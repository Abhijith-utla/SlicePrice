Great service, amazing food! 

Everytime I order from here the food is amazing. I tell all my friends about this place

5 stars
This restaurant has been around for 25+ years. Although ownership has changed, the food is still tasty and consistent. 

There are certain go-to dishes I would order from here, but really, all dishes are good choices depending on your preferences. This place still has 90's decor charm and the style is reminiscent of my childhood. The nostalgia hits hard, and I love the ability to revisit memory lane.

The service is quick, with a waitress coming around to refill waters and ensure all your needs are met. The dishes come in large portions, often enough for leftovers. The prices have increased due to economic inflation.

If you're looking for a no-frills Chinese restaurant with good food, large portions, and an easily accessible location, check out Little Hunan of Plano!

4 stars
First time trying this place. The food is reasonably priced, the staff are nice, and the food is decent. The Mongolian beef was tasty with the fried rice and the hot and sour soup was good. Unfortunately my lo mein lacked flavor and was under salted so it tasted pretty bland. Other than that, I'd be happy to try a new dish next time.

5 stars
The food is so good. The service was super fast . The ambiance was like your regular mom and pop restaurant.

I have been Loving this place for 30 years !!!  My daughter was eating the moo goo gai pan in a high chair and at 27 she still want to eat that for dinner.   Just not in a high chair.

5 stars
Food is always delicious in resteraunt and delivered.  The spicey garlic shrimp is exceptional!

5 stars
Food is yummy and very filling. The owner is super kind and this is the type of small business that should be supported! Family friendly and the inside is peaceful and allows you to enjoy a meal with some natural lighting too.

5 stars
My favorite Chinese food restaurant of all time. I grew up in Plano but live in Atlanta now. Every time I come back to visit, Little Hunan is a must-go. If you're looking for the best food, it doesn't get better than this place. The family that owns it are so nice and authentic. Give it a try. It's the best kept secret in DFW in my humble opinion.

4 stars
Their cashew chicken is delicious. Fast service. Authentic AF. 

Also their lunch special is pretty good.

In the quest for Friday night Chinese food, specifically hot and sour soup in Plano. 
This was excellent. The Hot and Sour was unreal...full of peas and very rich and hearty. The wonton soup was clean and delicious. The king shrimp was incredible, and the fried chicken was excellent. Of all things, the white rice was bland and overcooked.

5 stars
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The chicken and shrimp spring roll was fresh and chock full of meat.  The wonton soup is the best that I have eaten in a long time.  Ordered the garlic fried shrimp and spicy garlic shrimp.  Absolutely fantastic, plentiful, and fresh food.  Service is solid and food as well.

This will be my go to spot going forward

5 stars
This is still the best. 
I lived in the area from 99 to about 2010
This was our go to place. It made me so happy to see the same family running the restaurant.

Sting bean beef and chicken still the best.
Thank you

The menu could be more informative so first timers know exactly what vegetables are in the dishes.  Food service was very attentive and the restaurant was very clean.  We easily made two meals from our individual servings.

5 stars
The customer service is great. The food is amazing too. They have the right prices for a big family. I would recommend this restaurant for parties .

5 stars
Spicy Garlic Shrimp 
We good food for cheap! Definitely recommend to anyone in search of Chinese food

5 stars
Great family restaurant and fast service. My favorites are hot and sour soup and moo goo gai pan.

4 stars
This place is amazingly good, there schezuan beef has me still craving it weeks after I ate it. Definitely will be returning to try more of their delicious dishes

5 stars
Dinner special spicy fried chicken. It's good. Fast to go service.                          Great prices.

5 stars
Mapo tofu is my favorite here. Their portions are big. Called in for take out and they're straight to the point I appreciate how easy/fast it was. They accidentally mixed up my order with another person who already left with it, but they came back and it was fine. Just a good Chinese restaurant overall

2 stars
Flavorless. Great customer service but the food is a hard pass. Literally no flavor in the sauces. Four different dishes and not one was saved for leftovers. The Crab Rangoon had zero crab and should have been called onion Rangoon. Extremely disappointed. Will not eat here again.

5 stars
Listen. This place is REALLY good. I am Chinese so you better read up on this review. 

I came with my mom today. And here's the thing - there are NO chinese restaurants around town that we've found that appeases my mom. NONE. We came here for lunch, and as we ate, I took small glances at her and I saw her nodding, and saying "This is good."

MY MOM SAID THIS PLACE IS GOOD. SHE EVEN GAVE HER COMPLIMENTS TO OUR SERVER. 

If you're still hesitant because of the low star rating, well then I don't know what to tell you other than that you're definitely missing out on some really delicious authentic Chinese comfort food. It's alright though, it'll be your loss.

We only ordered two dishes today. Both were noodle dishes. And WE ALREADY KNOW WE'LL BE COMING BACK. THEY WERE DELICIOUS, and here's why:

The Lo mein - they didn't skimp out on the protein/toppings AT ALL. We ordered combo and there were lots of pieces of pork, shrimp, and chicken. YUM!! I'm craving it as I'm typing this! Even better is the fact that the food came out STEAMING HOT. THEY USED A WOK AND ITS OBVIOUS FROM THE AUTHENTIC TASTE AND FRESHNESS! THIS IS AS TRADITIONAL AS IT'LL GET FOLKS. 

The beef noodle soup - DELICIOUS!!! The meats were so tender and they didn't skimp out on the meats or bok choi either. Broth was simple and tasted clean. You're gonna tell me it'a tasteless?? Naw go get your tastebuds checked. 

Each dish tasted clean, fresh, and very authentic. The portions were HUGE! Even just between my mom and I, we were still able to pack half of each dish to go, allowing us to get 2 meals out of them. So worth it. And the meals here are so AFFORDABLE!!! Our total bill was less than $20.

Don't pass on this place. It's really really great. I apologize for the all caps because I really could not contain my excitement about how good this place is!

5 stars
The customer service is fast and the chicken noodle soup is so delicious omg. I never thought I would like it as much as I do. It's a lot of chicken in it as well. Enough for two days worth of food.

4 stars
This place has been here for years. Good food at good price. Don't expect anything fancy, just enjoy a reasonably priced meal. I would recommend.

5 stars
Little Hunan is simply the best I recommend the chicken fried rice, egg drop soup, wonton soup, and the sweet and sour chicken.

5 stars
Food is delicious and the servings are generous! The people there are friendly and helpful. Lots of options.

4 stars
The best chop suey hands down! Fast and affordable. Reminds me of the Chinese restaurant I grew up with.

4 stars
We did take out. A lot of food had dinner and 2 lunches out of the order.I didn't pick up but it was ready when my daughter did ans she said the were niced

5 stars
I am giving this place 5 stars. Walking in and the smell was so intense I knew I was going to love the food and god I was right. Fast friendly service and the price was perfect and had enough left over to take home. If you are questioning where to go for Chinese food around the area please drop by and enjoy some awesome food.

5 stars
I am always up to trying new mom and pop restaurants as I find them to offer the best food around.  Little Hunan was no exception.  First time in and was very impressed.  I dined with my wife and mother and we all loved what we ordered; the lemon chicken, Mongolian beef, happy family, beef egg foo young, egg drop soup and egg rolls.  It was a lot so we had food to take home for leftovers the next day.  The food is cooked fresh to order and immediately delivered to the table piping hot.  Staff was quick to check on us and provide us drink refills.  We will definitely be back!

5 stars
Their potstickers ad crab Rangoon are amazing. Every dish we've had has been great!Crab RangoonsPot Stickers

5 stars
Hubby wanted some General Tso's chicken and we wanted a spot to sit in and enjoy our food. Not the typical Chinese and who knew that wasn't a particularly easy request but so glad we found this spot. Typical Chinese American food but so good! We were so happy to find a quick delish spot that you can sit in and enjoy. Also so love a place run by family. Makes it even more important to share experiences at great spots.

4 stars
The owners are super nice and it's so cute that they have pictures of their children on the wall. I have to say their food is pretty authentic as someone who grew up eating this cuisine. Obviously they have the American Chinese dishes but they also have a lot of traditional dishes. Service is fast and very much no fuss, which I prefer. The only thing is their hot and sour soup is a bit weird in terms of the toppings. It's not bad, just a bit odd.

4 stars
One of my favorite places to go to for fried bean curd & vegetables. Veggies and sauce are fresh and cooked perfectly. Rice was done well too, would recommend.

5 stars
Everything's pretty good. It's your standard American Chinese spot, but it's one of the better ones around

1 stars
This is the worse Chinese food I have ever had. I was served 4 WINGGETS for $5.50. Not even the whole wing. Coming to Texas from New York I was truly disappointed. Food has no flavor. The food was horrible to say the least. I guess I can only have Chinese food when I visit home. What a disappointment.

4 stars
I always forget about this place, I guess its the out of site out of mind location, However, I did remember it when we had company and wanted chinese food delivered, When is the last time you had chinese delivered? Exactly! Litterally everything we ordered was fantastic. this is not your average americanized chinese you commonly find in every neighborhood. Its well prepared, flavorful and nice portions, The price is right also. dont hesitate to stop in for a bite or even if you dare, call for delivery!

5 stars
If you're looking for 50's Chinese dishes, and we were, this is the place!  It's clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious! The sizzling rice soup tasted just like some of our favorite places in from the past!

5 stars
This is our go to when we are in the area.  In fact, we plan trips to Allen around lunchtime, so we can eat here.  Everything we've tried is amazing, and we always try to get Hot & Sour soup to take home.  Blow the soup before eating, because it is very hot.  I cannot say enough good things about this place.

5 stars
Still a great place for Chinese. Dining room is now back. Order to go often here. Place has been in this shopping center for a long time and across the street from pep boys

5 stars
I have been coming here for over 15 years! It's been a family favorite! The staff is always friendly and personable! I love coming here and talking with everyone! 

I love that my husband can eat some of his favorite traditional Chinese dishes and I can have my shredded pork and garlic sauce! I'm also a big fan of their soups! If you have a cold or need something to warm your soul I could suggest the chicken noodle soup! It's so delicious! 

If you're in the area stop by and try this restaurant!!!

5 stars
Delicious authentic food, I especially love their Chop Suey - absolutely a must try for everyone!

4 stars
I have been coming to this place my whole life. Like actually, they have been open for my whole 22 years of living! The owners are so friendly and have known me and my family since I was little.

I love the food because it's more authentic than others places. I always get the same thing when I come here, but I rarely get tired of eating it. I always the the green beans with chicken, pork dish with shredded tofu, tofu and vegetables dish,  and hot and sour soup. The prices are reasonable and portions are hefty. 

It's a super casual place, but the owners are just the nicest and dish out some good Chinese food.

4 stars
Decided to try this place since it's right around the corner from us so ordered some takeout. Nice little spot and not very busy just yet. (There was no one there when I went around 6:45). They had the food prepared in the timeframe they said and it was still hot when I got home. The food was super fresh and flavorful. Overall pleasantly surprised and would try it again and maybe sit eat in to enjoy it more.

5 stars
I come to this small restaurant for affordable, fast, fresh and flavorful comfort food. I usually have the potstickers and chicken chop suey. I love the fresh tastes and textures of the vegetables and meats, and the portions are very generous. I always plan to take some home, but always finish everything!

5 stars
BEST Hunan/Chinese Cuisine I've ever had. Like y'all, that egg drop soup is LITERALLY the most flavorful, fresh, home cooked soup I've tried. The dishes I've tried are always so incredible! Lots of flavor in their dishes. Tastes very fresh. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Legit tastes homemade. Typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere but the food is ten times better than the generic crap we see way too often! I drive from Dallas, about 30 minutes, out of my way to eat here.

3 stars
I came for lunch on a weekday, but decided to not get the lunch special. Had a small sweet and sour soup, fish filet in black bean sauce, and spicy fried chicken. It came with either fried or white rice. The rice portion is pretty decent. The fish filet was really good and good portions. The spicy fried chicken was a little too saucy and not enough meat. The sauce was drowning the meat, and it was more of a soup. The hot and sour soup had big chunks of veggies that I wish were chopped smaller. Overall the food itself was pretty good and the price was average. If you're looking to get the best value definitely go with the lunch special. The food here is not quite Panda Express, but it's no where near an authentic Chinese restaurant. It's a classic American Chinese place, but the lack of authentic options is what makes it a 3 star for me.

1 stars
Food was tasteless. definitely don't order the pork Lo mein it was horrible. Egg rolls didn't have any meat. Sesame chicken and general tso's had no flavor they messed up my order and gave me the wrong soup crab rangoons are burnt. And when I asked for duck sauce for the egg rolls they told me they had the red sauce but didn't offer duck sauce. Will not be going back

5 stars
Have been going to this same restaurant for over 15 years. Delicious food, family run, and good prices, make this place a hole in the wall gem everyone should try at least once!

If you're looking for the best food, it doesn't get better than this place. The family that owns it are so nice and authentic. Give it a try. It's the best kept secret in DFW in my humble opinion.

Their cashew chicken is delicious. Fast service. Authentic AF. 

Also their lunch special is pretty good.

In the quest for Friday night Chinese food, specifically hot and sour soup in Plano. 
This was excellent. The Hot and Sour was unreal...full of peas and very rich and hearty. The wonton soup was clean and delicious. The king shrimp was incredible, and the fried chicken was excellent. Of all things, the white rice was bland and overcooked.

5 stars
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The chicken and shrimp spring roll was fresh and chock full of meat.  The wonton soup is the best that I have eaten in a long time.  Ordered the garlic fried shrimp and spicy garlic shrimp.  Absolutely fantastic, plentiful, and fresh food.  Service is solid and food as well.

This will be my go to spot going forward

5 stars
This is still the best. 
I lived in the area from 99 to about 2010
This was our go to place. It made me so happy to see the same family running the restaurant.

Sting bean beef and chicken still the best.
Thank you

The menu could be more informative so first timers know exactly what vegetables are in the dishes.  Food service was very attentive and the restaurant was very clean.  We easily made two meals from our individual servings.

5 stars
The customer service is great. The food is amazing too. They have the right prices for a big family. I would recommend this restaurant for parties .

Spicy Garlic Shrimp 
We good food for cheap! Definitely recommend to anyone in search of Chinese food

5 stars
Great family restaurant and fast service. My favorites are hot and sour soup and moo goo gai pan.

4 stars
This place is amazingly good, there schezuan beef has me still craving it weeks after I ate it. Definitely will be returning to try more of their delicious dishes

5 stars
Dinner special spicy fried chicken. It's good. Fast to go service.                          Great prices.

5 stars
Mapo tofu is my favorite here. Their portions are big. Called in for take out and they're straight to the point I appreciate how easy/fast it was. They accidentally mixed up my order with another person who already left with it, but they came back and it was fine. Just a good Chinese restaurant overall

2 stars
Flavorless. Great customer service but the food is a hard pass. Literally no flavor in the sauces. Four different dishes and not one was saved for leftovers. The Crab Rangoon had zero crab and should have been called onion Rangoon. Extremely disappointed. Will not eat here again.

5 stars
Listen. This place is REALLY good. I am Chinese so you better read up on this review. 

I came with my mom today. And here's the thing - there are NO chinese restaurants around town that we've found that appeases my mom. NONE. We came here for lunch, and as we ate, I took small glances at her and I saw her nodding, and saying "This is good."

MY MOM SAID THIS PLACE IS GOOD. SHE EVEN GAVE HER COMPLIMENTS TO OUR SERVER. 

If you're still hesitant because of the low star rating, well then I don't know what to tell you other than that you're definitely missing out on some really delicious authentic Chinese comfort food. It's alright though, it'll be your loss.

We only ordered two dishes today. Both were noodle dishes. And WE ALREADY KNOW WE'LL BE COMING BACK. THEY WERE DELICIOUS, and here's why:

The Lo mein - they didn't skimp out on the protein/toppings AT ALL. We ordered combo and there were lots of pieces of pork, shrimp, and chicken. YUM!! I'm craving it as I'm typing this! Even better is the fact that the food came out STEAMING HOT. THEY USED A WOK AND ITS OBVIOUS FROM THE AUTHENTIC TASTE AND FRESHNESS! THIS IS AS TRADITIONAL AS IT'LL GET FOLKS. 

The beef noodle soup - DELICIOUS!!! The meats were so tender and they didn't skimp out on the meats or bok choi either. Broth was simple and tasted clean. You're gonna tell me it'a tasteless?? Naw go get your tastebuds checked. 

Each dish tasted clean, fresh, and very authentic. The portions were HUGE! Even just between my mom and I, we were still able to pack half of each dish to go, allowing us to get 2 meals out of them. So worth it. And the meals here are so AFFORDABLE!!! Our total bill was less than $20.

Don't pass on this place. It's really really great. I apologize for the all caps because I really could not contain my excitement about how good this place is!

5 stars
The customer service is fast and the chicken noodle soup is so delicious omg. I never thought I would like it as much as I do. It's a lot of chicken in it as well. Enough for two days worth of food.

4 stars
This place has been here for years. Good food at good price. Don't expect anything fancy, just enjoy a reasonably priced meal. I would recommend.

5 stars
Little Hunan is simply the best I recommend the chicken fried rice, egg drop soup, wonton soup, and the sweet and sour chicken.

5 stars
Food is delicious and the servings are generous! The people there are friendly and helpful. Lots of options.

4 stars
The best chop suey hands down! Fast and affordable. Reminds me of the Chinese restaurant I grew up with.

4 stars
We did take out. A lot of food had dinner and 2 lunches out of the order.I didn't pick up but it was ready when my daughter did ans she said the were niced

5 stars
I am giving this place 5 stars. Walking in and the smell was so intense I knew I was going to love the food and god I was right. Fast friendly service and the price was perfect and had enough left over to take home. If you are questioning where to go for Chinese food around the area please drop by and enjoy some awesome food.

5 stars
I am always up to trying new mom and pop restaurants as I find them to offer the best food around.  Little Hunan was no exception.  First time in and was very impressed.  I dined with my wife and mother and we all loved what we ordered; the lemon chicken, Mongolian beef, happy family, beef egg foo young, egg drop soup and egg rolls.  It was a lot so we had food to take home for leftovers the next day.  The food is cooked fresh to order and immediately delivered to the table piping hot.  Staff was quick to check on us and provide us drink refills.  We will definitely be back!

5 stars
Their potstickers ad crab Rangoon are amazing. Every dish we've had has been great!Crab RangoonsPot Stickers

5 stars
Hubby wanted some General Tso's chicken and we wanted a spot to sit in and enjoy our food. Not the typical Chinese and who knew that wasn't a particularly easy request but so glad we found this spot. Typical Chinese American food but so good! We were so happy to find a quick delish spot that you can sit in and enjoy. Also so love a place run by family. Makes it even more important to share experiences at great spots.

4 stars
The owners are super nice and it's so cute that they have pictures of their children on the wall. I have to say their food is pretty authentic as someone who grew up eating this cuisine. Obviously they have the American Chinese dishes but they also have a lot of traditional dishes. Service is fast and very much no fuss, which I prefer. The only thing is their hot and sour soup is a bit weird in terms of the toppings. It's not bad, just a bit odd.

4 stars
One of my favorite places to go to for fried bean curd & vegetables. Veggies and sauce are fresh and cooked perfectly. Rice was done well too, would recommend.

5 stars
Everything's pretty good. It's your standard American Chinese spot, but it's one of the better ones around

1 stars
This is the worse Chinese food I have ever had. I was served 4 WINGGETS for $5.50. Not even the whole wing. Coming to Texas from New York I was truly disappointed. Food has no flavor. The food was horrible to say the least. I guess I can only have Chinese food when I visit home. What a disappointment.

4 stars
I always forget about this place, I guess its the out of site out of mind location, However, I did remember it when we had company and wanted chinese food delivered, When is the last time you had chinese delivered? Exactly! Litterally everything we ordered was fantastic. this is not your average americanized chinese you commonly find in every neighborhood. Its well prepared, flavorful and nice portions, The price is right also. dont hesitate to stop in for a bite or even if you dare, call for delivery!

5 stars
If you're looking for 50's Chinese dishes, and we were, this is the place!  It's clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious! The sizzling rice soup tasted just like some of our favorite places in from the past!

5 stars
This is our go to when we are in the area.  In fact, we plan trips to Allen around lunchtime, so we can eat here.  Everything we've tried is amazing, and we always try to get Hot & Sour soup to take home.  Blow the soup before eating, because it is very hot.  I cannot say enough good things about this place.

5 stars
Still a great place for Chinese. Dining room is now back. Order to go often here. Place has been in this shopping center for a long time and across the street from pep boys

5 stars
I have been coming here for over 15 years! It's been a family favorite! The staff is always friendly and personable! I love coming here and talking with everyone! 

I love that my husband can eat some of his favorite traditional Chinese dishes and I can have my shredded pork and garlic sauce! I'm also a big fan of their soups! If you have a cold or need something to warm your soul I could suggest the chicken noodle soup! It's so delicious! 

If you're in the area stop by and try this restaurant!!!

5 stars
Delicious authentic food, I especially love their Chop Suey - absolutely a must try for everyone!

4 stars
I have been coming to this place my whole life. Like actually, they have been open for my whole 22 years of living! The owners are so friendly and have known me and my family since I was little.

I love the food because it's more authentic than others places. I always get the same thing when I come here, but I rarely get tired of eating it. I always the the green beans with chicken, pork dish with shredded tofu, tofu and vegetables dish,  and hot and sour soup. The prices are reasonable and portions are hefty. 

It's a super casual place, but the owners are just the nicest and dish out some good Chinese food.

4 stars
Decided to try this place since it's right around the corner from us so ordered some takeout. Nice little spot and not very busy just yet. (There was no one there when I went around 6:45). They had the food prepared in the timeframe they said and it was still hot when I got home. The food was super fresh and flavorful. Overall pleasantly surprised and would try it again and maybe sit eat in to enjoy it more.

5 stars
I come to this small restaurant for affordable, fast, fresh and flavorful comfort food. I usually have the potstickers and chicken chop suey. I love the fresh tastes and textures of the vegetables and meats, and the portions are very generous. I always plan to take some home, but always finish everything!

5 stars
BEST Hunan/Chinese Cuisine I've ever had. Like y'all, that egg drop soup is LITERALLY the most flavorful, fresh, home cooked soup I've tried. The dishes I've tried are always so incredible! Lots of flavor in their dishes. Tastes very fresh. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Legit tastes homemade. Typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere but the food is ten times better than the generic crap we see way too often! I drive from Dallas, about 30 minutes, out of my way to eat here.

3 stars
I came for lunch on a weekday, but decided to not get the lunch special. Had a small sweet and sour soup, fish filet in black bean sauce, and spicy fried chicken. It came with either fried or white rice. The rice portion is pretty decent. The fish filet was really good and good portions. The spicy fried chicken was a little too saucy and not enough meat. The sauce was drowning the meat, and it was more of a soup. The hot and sour soup had big chunks of veggies that I wish were chopped smaller. Overall the food itself was pretty good and the price was average. If you're looking to get the best value definitely go with the lunch special. The food here is not quite Panda Express, but it's no where near an authentic Chinese restaurant. It's a classic American Chinese place, but the lack of authentic options is what makes it a 3 star for me.

1 stars
Food was tasteless. definitely don't order the pork Lo mein it was horrible. Egg rolls didn't have any meat. Sesame chicken and general tso's had no flavor they messed up my order and gave me the wrong soup crab rangoons are burnt. And when I asked for duck sauce for the egg rolls they told me they had the red sauce but didn't offer duck sauce. Will not be going back

5 stars
Have been going to this same restaurant for over 15 years. Delicious food, family run, and good prices, make this place a hole in the wall gem everyone should try at least once!

2 stars
Large portions, and thought they followed good hygiene protocol, but most recent order had hair in it. Won't be going back.

5 stars
Great service, amazing food! 

Everytime I order from here the food is amazing. I tell all my friends about this place

5 stars
This restaurant has been around for 25+ years. Although ownership has changed, the food is still tasty and consistent. 

There are certain go-to dishes I would order from here, but really, all dishes are good choices depending on your preferences. This place still has 90's decor charm and the style is reminiscent of my childhood. The nostalgia hits hard, and I love the ability to revisit memory lane.

The service is quick, with a waitress coming around to refill waters and ensure all your needs are met. The dishes come in large portions, often enough for leftovers. The prices have increased due to economic inflation.

If you're looking for a no-frills Chinese restaurant with good food, large portions, and an easily accessible location, check out Little Hunan of Plano!

4 stars
First time trying this place. The food is reasonably priced, the staff are nice, and the food is decent. The Mongolian beef was tasty with the fried rice and the hot and sour soup was good. Unfortunately my lo mein lacked flavor and was under salted so it tasted pretty bland. Other than that, I'd be happy to try a new dish next time.

This place is amazingly good, there schezuan beef has me still craving it weeks after I ate it. Definitely will be returning to try more of their delicious dishes

5 stars
Dinner special spicy fried chicken. It's good. Fast to go service.                          Great prices.

5 stars
Mapo tofu is my favorite here. Their portions are big. Called in for take out and they're straight to the point I appreciate how easy/fast it was. They accidentally mixed up my order with another person who already left with it, but they came back and it was fine. Just a good Chinese restaurant overall

2 stars
Flavorless. Great customer service but the food is a hard pass. Literally no flavor in the sauces. Four different dishes and not one was saved for leftovers. The Crab Rangoon had zero crab and should have been called onion Rangoon. Extremely disappointed. Will not eat here again.

Listen. This place is REALLY good. I am Chinese so you better read up on this review. 

I came with my mom today. And here's the thing - there are NO chinese restaurants around town that we've found that appeases my mom. NONE. We came here for lunch, and as we ate, I took small glances at her and I saw her nodding, and saying "This is good."

MY MOM SAID THIS PLACE IS GOOD. SHE EVEN GAVE HER COMPLIMENTS TO OUR SERVER. 

If you're still hesitant because of the low star rating, well then I don't know what to tell you other than that you're definitely missing out on some really delicious authentic Chinese comfort food. It's alright though, it'll be your loss.

We only ordered two dishes today. Both were noodle dishes. And WE ALREADY KNOW WE'LL BE COMING BACK. THEY WERE DELICIOUS, and here's why:

The Lo mein - they didn't skimp out on the protein/toppings AT ALL. We ordered combo and there were lots of pieces of pork, shrimp, and chicken. YUM!! I'm craving it as I'm typing this! Even better is the fact that the food came out STEAMING HOT. THEY USED A WOK AND ITS OBVIOUS FROM THE AUTHENTIC TASTE AND FRESHNESS! THIS IS AS TRADITIONAL AS IT'LL GET FOLKS. 

The beef noodle soup - DELICIOUS!!! The meats were so tender and they didn't skimp out on the meats or bok choi either. Broth was simple and tasted clean. You're gonna tell me it'a tasteless?? Naw go get your tastebuds checked. 

Each dish tasted clean, fresh, and very authentic. The portions were HUGE! Even just between my mom and I, we were still able to pack half of each dish to go, allowing us to get 2 meals out of them. So worth it. And the meals here are so AFFORDABLE!!! Our total bill was less than $20.

Don't pass on this place. It's really really great. I apologize for the all caps because I really could not contain my excitement about how good this place is!

5 stars
The customer service is fast and the chicken noodle soup is so delicious omg. I never thought I would like it as much as I do. It's a lot of chicken in it as well. Enough for two days worth of food.

4 stars
This place has been here for years. Good food at good price. Don't expect anything fancy, just enjoy a reasonably priced meal. I would recommend.

5 stars
Little Hunan is simply the best I recommend the chicken fried rice, egg drop soup, wonton soup, and the sweet and sour chicken.

5 stars
Food is delicious and the servings are generous! The people there are friendly and helpful. Lots of options.

4 stars
The best chop suey hands down! Fast and affordable. Reminds me of the Chinese restaurant I grew up with.

4 stars
We did take out. A lot of food had dinner and 2 lunches out of the order.I didn't pick up but it was ready when my daughter did ans she said the were niced

5 stars
I am giving this place 5 stars. Walking in and the smell was so intense I knew I was going to love the food and god I was right. Fast friendly service and the price was perfect and had enough left over to take home. If you are questioning where to go for Chinese food around the area please drop by and enjoy some awesome food.

5 stars
I am always up to trying new mom and pop restaurants as I find them to offer the best food around.  Little Hunan was no exception.  First time in and was very impressed.  I dined with my wife and mother and we all loved what we ordered; the lemon chicken, Mongolian beef, happy family, beef egg foo young, egg drop soup and egg rolls.  It was a lot so we had food to take home for leftovers the next day.  The food is cooked fresh to order and immediately delivered to the table piping hot.  Staff was quick to check on us and provide us drink refills.  We will definitely be back!

5 stars
Their potstickers ad crab Rangoon are amazing. Every dish we've had has been great!Crab RangoonsPot Stickers

Hubby wanted some General Tso's chicken and we wanted a spot to sit in and enjoy our food. Not the typical Chinese and who knew that wasn't a particularly easy request but so glad we found this spot. Typical Chinese American food but so good! We were so happy to find a quick delish spot that you can sit in and enjoy. Also so love a place run by family. Makes it even more important to share experiences at great spots.

4 stars
The owners are super nice and it's so cute that they have pictures of their children on the wall. I have to say their food is pretty authentic as someone who grew up eating this cuisine. Obviously they have the American Chinese dishes but they also have a lot of traditional dishes. Service is fast and very much no fuss, which I prefer. The only thing is their hot and sour soup is a bit weird in terms of the toppings. It's not bad, just a bit odd.

4 stars
One of my favorite places to go to for fried bean curd & vegetables. Veggies and sauce are fresh and cooked perfectly. Rice was done well too, would recommend.

5 stars
Everything's pretty good. It's your standard American Chinese spot, but it's one of the better ones around

1 stars
This is the worse Chinese food I have ever had. I was served 4 WINGGETS for $5.50. Not even the whole wing. Coming to Texas from New York I was truly disappointed. Food has no flavor. The food was horrible to say the least. I guess I can only have Chinese food when I visit home. What a disappointment.

4 stars
I always forget about this place, I guess its the out of site out of mind location, However, I did remember it when we had company and wanted chinese food delivered, When is the last time you had chinese delivered? Exactly! Litterally everything we ordered was fantastic. this is not your average americanized chinese you commonly find in every neighborhood. Its well prepared, flavorful and nice portions, The price is right also. dont hesitate to stop in for a bite or even if you dare, call for delivery!

5 stars
If you're looking for 50's Chinese dishes, and we were, this is the place!  It's clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious! The sizzling rice soup tasted just like some of our favorite places in from the past!

5 stars
This is our go to when we are in the area.  In fact, we plan trips to Allen around lunchtime, so we can eat here.  Everything we've tried is amazing, and we always try to get Hot & Sour soup to take home.  Blow the soup before eating, because it is very hot.  I cannot say enough good things about this place.

5 stars
Still a great place for Chinese. Dining room is now back. Order to go often here. Place has been in this shopping center for a long time and across the street from pep boys

5 stars
I have been coming here for over 15 years! It's been a family favorite! The staff is always friendly and personable! I love coming here and talking with everyone! 

I love that my husband can eat some of his favorite traditional Chinese dishes and I can have my shredded pork and garlic sauce! I'm also a big fan of their soups! If you have a cold or need something to warm your soul I could suggest the chicken noodle soup! It's so delicious! 

If you're in the area stop by and try this restaurant!!!

5 stars
Delicious authentic food, I especially love their Chop Suey - absolutely a must try for everyone!

4 stars
I have been coming to this place my whole life. Like actually, they have been open for my whole 22 years of living! The owners are so friendly and have known me and my family since I was little.

I love the food because it's more authentic than others places. I always get the same thing when I come here, but I rarely get tired of eating it. I always the the green beans with chicken, pork dish with shredded tofu, tofu and vegetables dish,  and hot and sour soup. The prices are reasonable and portions are hefty. 

It's a super casual place, but the owners are just the nicest and dish out some good Chinese food.

4 stars
Decided to try this place since it's right around the corner from us so ordered some takeout. Nice little spot and not very busy just yet. (There was no one there when I went around 6:45). They had the food prepared in the timeframe they said and it was still hot when I got home. The food was super fresh and flavorful. Overall pleasantly surprised and would try it again and maybe sit eat in to enjoy it more.

5 stars
I come to this small restaurant for affordable, fast, fresh and flavorful comfort food. I usually have the potstickers and chicken chop suey. I love the fresh tastes and textures of the vegetables and meats, and the portions are very generous. I always plan to take some home, but always finish everything!

5 stars
BEST Hunan/Chinese Cuisine I've ever had. Like y'all, that egg drop soup is LITERALLY the most flavorful, fresh, home cooked soup I've tried. The dishes I've tried are always so incredible! Lots of flavor in their dishes. Tastes very fresh. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Legit tastes homemade. Typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere but the food is ten times better than the generic crap we see way too often! I drive from Dallas, about 30 minutes, out of my way to eat here.

3 stars
I came for lunch on a weekday, but decided to not get the lunch special. Had a small sweet and sour soup, fish filet in black bean sauce, and spicy fried chicken. It came with either fried or white rice. The rice portion is pretty decent. The fish filet was really good and good portions. The spicy fried chicken was a little too saucy and not enough meat. The sauce was drowning the meat, and it was more of a soup. The hot and sour soup had big chunks of veggies that I wish were chopped smaller. Overall the food itself was pretty good and the price was average. If you're looking to get the best value definitely go with the lunch special. The food here is not quite Panda Express, but it's no where near an authentic Chinese restaurant. It's a classic American Chinese place, but the lack of authentic options is what makes it a 3 star for me.

1 stars
Food was tasteless. definitely don't order the pork Lo mein it was horrible. Egg rolls didn't have any meat. Sesame chicken and general tso's had no flavor they messed up my order and gave me the wrong soup crab rangoons are burnt. And when I asked for duck sauce for the egg rolls they told me they had the red sauce but didn't offer duck sauce. Will not be going back

5 stars
Have been going to this same restaurant for over 15 years. Delicious food, family run, and good prices, make this place a hole in the wall gem everyone should try at least once!

2 stars
Large portions, and thought they followed good hygiene protocol, but most recent order had hair in it. Won't be going back.

5 stars
Great service, amazing food! 

Everytime I order from here the food is amazing. I tell all my friends about this place

5 stars
This restaurant has been around for 25+ years. Although ownership has changed, the food is still tasty and consistent. 

There are certain go-to dishes I would order from here, but really, all dishes are good choices depending on your preferences. This place still has 90's decor charm and the style is reminiscent of my childhood. The nostalgia hits hard, and I love the ability to revisit memory lane.

The service is quick, with a waitress coming around to refill waters and ensure all your needs are met. The dishes come in large portions, often enough for leftovers. The prices have increased due to economic inflation.

If you're looking for a no-frills Chinese restaurant with good food, large portions, and an easily accessible location, check out Little Hunan of Plano!

4 stars
First time trying this place. The food is reasonably priced, the staff are nice, and the food is decent. The Mongolian beef was tasty with the fried rice and the hot and sour soup was good. Unfortunately my lo mein lacked flavor and was under salted so it tasted pretty bland. Other than that, I'd be happy to try a new dish next time.

5 stars
The food is so good. The service was super fast . The ambiance was like your regular mom and pop restaurant.

5 stars
I have been Loving this place for 30 years !!!  My daughter was eating the moo goo gai pan in a high chair and at 27 she still want to eat that for dinner.   Just not in a high chair.

5 stars
Food is always delicious in resteraunt and delivered.  The spicey garlic shrimp is exceptional!

5 stars
Food is yummy and very filling. The owner is super kind and this is the type of small business that should be supported! Family friendly and the inside is peaceful and allows you to enjoy a meal with some natural lighting too.

5 stars
My favorite Chinese food restaurant of all time. I grew up in Plano but live in Atlanta now. Every time I come back to visit, Little Hunan is a must-go. If you're looking for the best food, it doesn't get better than this place. The family that owns it are so nice and authentic. Give it a try. It's the best kept secret in DFW in my humble opinion.

4 stars
Their cashew chicken is delicious. Fast service. Authentic AF. 

Also their lunch special is pretty good.

4 stars
In the quest for Friday night Chinese food, specifically hot and sour soup in Plano. 
This was excellent. The Hot and Sour was unreal...full of peas and very rich and hearty. The wonton soup was clean and delicious. The king shrimp was incredible, and the fried chicken was excellent. Of all things, the white rice was bland and overcooked.

5 stars
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The chicken and shrimp spring roll was fresh and chock full of meat.  The wonton soup is the best that I have eaten in a long time.  Ordered the garlic fried shrimp and spicy garlic shrimp.  Absolutely fantastic, plentiful, and fresh food.  Service is solid and food as well.

This will be my go to spot going forward

5 stars
This is still the best. 
I lived in the area from 99 to about 2010
This was our go to place. It made me so happy to see the same family running the restaurant.

Sting bean beef and chicken still the best.
Thank you

Even better is the fact that the food came out STEAMING HOT. THEY USED A WOK AND ITS OBVIOUS FROM THE AUTHENTIC TASTE AND FRESHNESS! THIS IS AS TRADITIONAL AS IT'LL GET FOLKS. 

The beef noodle soup - DELICIOUS!!! The meats were so tender and they didn't skimp out on the meats or bok choi either. Broth was simple and tasted clean. You're gonna tell me it'a tasteless?? Naw go get your tastebuds checked. 

Each dish tasted clean, fresh, and very authentic. The portions were HUGE! Even just between my mom and I, we were still able to pack half of each dish to go, allowing us to get 2 meals out of them. So worth it. And the meals here are so AFFORDABLE!!! Our total bill was less than $20.

Don't pass on this place. It's really really great. I apologize for the all caps because I really could not contain my excitement about how good this place is!

The customer service is fast and the chicken noodle soup is so delicious omg. I never thought I would like it as much as I do. It's a lot of chicken in it as well. Enough for two days worth of food.

4 stars
This place has been here for years. Good food at good price. Don't expect anything fancy, just enjoy a reasonably priced meal. I would recommend.

Little Hunan is simply the best I recommend the chicken fried rice, egg drop soup, wonton soup, and the sweet and sour chicken.

5 stars
Food is delicious and the servings are generous! The people there are friendly and helpful. Lots of options.

The best chop suey hands down! Fast and affordable. Reminds me of the Chinese restaurant I grew up with.

4 stars
We did take out. A lot of food had dinner and 2 lunches out of the order.I didn't pick up but it was ready when my daughter did ans she said the were niced

5 stars
I am giving this place 5 stars. Walking in and the smell was so intense I knew I was going to love the food and god I was right. Fast friendly service and the price was perfect and had enough left over to take home. If you are questioning where to go for Chinese food around the area please drop by and enjoy some awesome food.

5 stars
I am always up to trying new mom and pop restaurants as I find them to offer the best food around.  Little Hunan was no exception.  First time in and was very impressed.  I dined with my wife and mother and we all loved what we ordered; the lemon chicken, Mongolian beef, happy family, beef egg foo young, egg drop soup and egg rolls.  It was a lot so we had food to take home for leftovers the next day.  The food is cooked fresh to order and immediately delivered to the table piping hot.  Staff was quick to check on us and provide us drink refills.  We will definitely be back!

5 stars
Their potstickers ad crab Rangoon are amazing. Every dish we've had has been great!Crab RangoonsPot Stickers

Hubby wanted some General Tso's chicken and we wanted a spot to sit in and enjoy our food. Not the typical Chinese and who knew that wasn't a particularly easy request but so glad we found this spot. Typical Chinese American food but so good! We were so happy to find a quick delish spot that you can sit in and enjoy. Also so love a place run by family. Makes it even more important to share experiences at great spots.

4 stars
The owners are super nice and it's so cute that they have pictures of their children on the wall. I have to say their food is pretty authentic as someone who grew up eating this cuisine. Obviously they have the American Chinese dishes but they also have a lot of traditional dishes. Service is fast and very much no fuss, which I prefer. The only thing is their hot and sour soup is a bit weird in terms of the toppings. It's not bad, just a bit odd.

4 stars
One of my favorite places to go to for fried bean curd & vegetables. Veggies and sauce are fresh and cooked perfectly. Rice was done well too, would recommend.

5 stars
Everything's pretty good. It's your standard American Chinese spot, but it's one of the better ones around

1 stars
This is the worse Chinese food I have ever had. I was served 4 WINGGETS for $5.50. Not even the whole wing. Coming to Texas from New York I was truly disappointed. Food has no flavor. The food was horrible to say the least. I guess I can only have Chinese food when I visit home. What a disappointment.

4 stars
I always forget about this place, I guess its the out of site out of mind location, However, I did remember it when we had company and wanted chinese food delivered, When is the last time you had chinese delivered? Exactly! Litterally everything we ordered was fantastic. this is not your average americanized chinese you commonly find in every neighborhood. Its well prepared, flavorful and nice portions, The price is right also. dont hesitate to stop in for a bite or even if you dare, call for delivery!

5 stars
If you're looking for 50's Chinese dishes, and we were, this is the place!  It's clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious! The sizzling rice soup tasted just like some of our favorite places in from the past!

5 stars
This is our go to when we are in the area.  In fact, we plan trips to Allen around lunchtime, so we can eat here.  Everything we've tried is amazing, and we always try to get Hot & Sour soup to take home.  Blow the soup before eating, because it is very hot.  I cannot say enough good things about this place.

5 stars
Still a great place for Chinese. Dining room is now back. Order to go often here. Place has been in this shopping center for a long time and across the street from pep boys

5 stars
I have been coming here for over 15 years! It's been a family favorite! The staff is always friendly and personable! I love coming here and talking with everyone! 

I love that my husband can eat some of his favorite traditional Chinese dishes and I can have my shredded pork and garlic sauce! I'm also a big fan of their soups! If you have a cold or need something to warm your soul I could suggest the chicken noodle soup! It's so delicious! 

If you're in the area stop by and try this restaurant!!!

5 stars
Delicious authentic food, I especially love their Chop Suey - absolutely a must try for everyone!

4 stars
I have been coming to this place my whole life. Like actually, they have been open for my whole 22 years of living! The owners are so friendly and have known me and my family since I was little.

I love the food because it's more authentic than others places. I always get the same thing when I come here, but I rarely get tired of eating it. I always the the green beans with chicken, pork dish with shredded tofu, tofu and vegetables dish,  and hot and sour soup. The prices are reasonable and portions are hefty. 

It's a super casual place, but the owners are just the nicest and dish out some good Chinese food.

4 stars
Decided to try this place since it's right around the corner from us so ordered some takeout. Nice little spot and not very busy just yet. (There was no one there when I went around 6:45). They had the food prepared in the timeframe they said and it was still hot when I got home. The food was super fresh and flavorful. Overall pleasantly surprised and would try it again and maybe sit eat in to enjoy it more.

5 stars
I come to this small restaurant for affordable, fast, fresh and flavorful comfort food. I usually have the potstickers and chicken chop suey. I love the fresh tastes and textures of the vegetables and meats, and the portions are very generous. I always plan to take some home, but always finish everything!

5 stars
BEST Hunan/Chinese Cuisine I've ever had. Like y'all, that egg drop soup is LITERALLY the most flavorful, fresh, home cooked soup I've tried. The dishes I've tried are always so incredible! Lots of flavor in their dishes. Tastes very fresh. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Legit tastes homemade. Typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere but the food is ten times better than the generic crap we see way too often! I drive from Dallas, about 30 minutes, out of my way to eat here.

3 stars
I came for lunch on a weekday, but decided to not get the lunch special. Had a small sweet and sour soup, fish filet in black bean sauce, and spicy fried chicken. It came with either fried or white rice. The rice portion is pretty decent. The fish filet was really good and good portions. The spicy fried chicken was a little too saucy and not enough meat. The sauce was drowning the meat, and it was more of a soup. The hot and sour soup had big chunks of veggies that I wish were chopped smaller. Overall the food itself was pretty good and the price was average. If you're looking to get the best value definitely go with the lunch special. The food here is not quite Panda Express, but it's no where near an authentic Chinese restaurant. It's a classic American Chinese place, but the lack of authentic options is what makes it a 3 star for me.

1 stars
Food was tasteless. definitely don't order the pork Lo mein it was horrible. Egg rolls didn't have any meat. Sesame chicken and general tso's had no flavor they messed up my order and gave me the wrong soup crab rangoons are burnt. And when I asked for duck sauce for the egg rolls they told me they had the red sauce but didn't offer duck sauce. Will not be going back

5 stars
Have been going to this same restaurant for over 15 years. Delicious food, family run, and good prices, make this place a hole in the wall gem everyone should try at least once!

2 stars
Large portions, and thought they followed good hygiene protocol, but most recent order had hair in it. Won't be going back.

5 stars
Great service, amazing food! 

Everytime I order from here the food is amazing. I tell all my friends about this place

5 stars
This restaurant has been around for 25+ years. Although ownership has changed, the food is still tasty and consistent. 

There are certain go-to dishes I would order from here, but really, all dishes are good choices depending on your preferences. This place still has 90's decor charm and the style is reminiscent of my childhood. The nostalgia hits hard, and I love the ability to revisit memory lane.

The service is quick, with a waitress coming around to refill waters and ensure all your needs are met. The dishes come in large portions, often enough for leftovers. The prices have increased due to economic inflation.

If you're looking for a no-frills Chinese restaurant with good food, large portions, and an easily accessible location, check out Little Hunan of Plano!

4 stars
First time trying this place. The food is reasonably priced, the staff are nice, and the food is decent. The Mongolian beef was tasty with the fried rice and the hot and sour soup was good. Unfortunately my lo mein lacked flavor and was under salted so it tasted pretty bland. Other than that, I'd be happy to try a new dish next time.

5 stars
The food is so good. The service was super fast . The ambiance was like your regular mom and pop restaurant.

5 stars
I have been Loving this place for 30 years !!!  My daughter was eating the moo goo gai pan in a high chair and at 27 she still want to eat that for dinner.   Just not in a high chair.

5 stars
Food is always delicious in resteraunt and delivered.  The spicey garlic shrimp is exceptional!

5 stars
Food is yummy and very filling. The owner is super kind and this is the type of small business that should be supported! Family friendly and the inside is peaceful and allows you to enjoy a meal with some natural lighting too.

5 stars
My favorite Chinese food restaurant of all time. I grew up in Plano but live in Atlanta now. Every time I come back to visit, Little Hunan is a must-go. If you're looking for the best food, it doesn't get better than this place. The family that owns it are so nice and authentic. Give it a try. It's the best kept secret in DFW in my humble opinion.

4 stars
Their cashew chicken is delicious. Fast service. Authentic AF. 

Also their lunch special is pretty good.

4 stars
In the quest for Friday night Chinese food, specifically hot and sour soup in Plano. 
This was excellent. The Hot and Sour was unreal...full of peas and very rich and hearty. The wonton soup was clean and delicious. The king shrimp was incredible, and the fried chicken was excellent. Of all things, the white rice was bland and overcooked.

5 stars
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The chicken and shrimp spring roll was fresh and chock full of meat.  The wonton soup is the best that I have eaten in a long time.  Ordered the garlic fried shrimp and spicy garlic shrimp.  Absolutely fantastic, plentiful, and fresh food.  Service is solid and food as well.

This will be my go to spot going forward

5 stars
This is still the best. 
I lived in the area from 99 to about 2010
This was our go to place. It made me so happy to see the same family running the restaurant.

Sting bean beef and chicken still the best.
Thank you

The menu could be more informative so first timers know exactly what vegetables are in the dishes.  Food service was very attentive and the restaurant was very clean.  We easily made two meals from our individual servings.

Dinner special spicy fried chicken. It's good. Fast to go service.                          Great prices.

Mapo tofu is my favorite here. Their portions are big. Called in for take out and they're straight to the point I appreciate how easy/fast it was. They accidentally mixed up my order with another person who already left with it, but they came back and it was fine. Just a good Chinese restaurant overall

2 stars
Flavorless. Great customer service but the food is a hard pass. Literally no flavor in the sauces. Four different dishes and not one was saved for leftovers. The Crab Rangoon had zero crab and should have been called onion Rangoon. Extremely disappointed. Will not eat here again.

5 stars
Listen. This place is REALLY good. I am Chinese so you better read up on this review. 

I came with my mom today. And here's the thing - there are NO chinese restaurants around town that we've found that appeases my mom. NONE. We came here for lunch, and as we ate, I took small glances at her and I saw her nodding, and saying "This is good."

MY MOM SAID THIS PLACE IS GOOD. SHE EVEN GAVE HER COMPLIMENTS TO OUR SERVER. 

If you're still hesitant because of the low star rating, well then I don't know what to tell you other than that you're definitely missing out on some really delicious authentic Chinese comfort food. It's alright though, it'll be your loss.

I am giving this place 5 stars. Walking in and the smell was so intense I knew I was going to love the food and god I was right. Fast friendly service and the price was perfect and had enough left over to take home. If you are questioning where to go for Chinese food around the area please drop by and enjoy some awesome food.

I am always up to trying new mom and pop restaurants as I find them to offer the best food around.  Little Hunan was no exception.  First time in and was very impressed.  I dined with my wife and mother and we all loved what we ordered; the lemon chicken, Mongolian beef, happy family, beef egg foo young, egg drop soup and egg rolls.  It was a lot so we had food to take home for leftovers the next day.  The food is cooked fresh to order and immediately delivered to the table piping hot.  Staff was quick to check on us and provide us drink refills.  We will definitely be back!

Hubby wanted some General Tso's chicken and we wanted a spot to sit in and enjoy our food. Not the typical Chinese and who knew that wasn't a particularly easy request but so glad we found this spot. Typical Chinese American food but so good! We were so happy to find a quick delish spot that you can sit in and enjoy. Also so love a place run by family. Makes it even more important to share experiences at great spots.

4 stars
The owners are super nice and it's so cute that they have pictures of their children on the wall. I have to say their food is pretty authentic as someone who grew up eating this cuisine. Obviously they have the American Chinese dishes but they also have a lot of traditional dishes. Service is fast and very much no fuss, which I prefer. The only thing is their hot and sour soup is a bit weird in terms of the toppings. It's not bad, just a bit odd.

4 stars
One of my favorite places to go to for fried bean curd & vegetables. Veggies and sauce are fresh and cooked perfectly. Rice was done well too, would recommend.

5 stars
Everything's pretty good. It's your standard American Chinese spot, but it's one of the better ones around

This is the worse Chinese food I have ever had. I was served 4 WINGGETS for $5.50. Not even the whole wing. Coming to Texas from New York I was truly disappointed. Food has no flavor. The food was horrible to say the least. I guess I can only have Chinese food when I visit home. What a disappointment.

4 stars
I always forget about this place, I guess its the out of site out of mind location, However, I did remember it when we had company and wanted chinese food delivered, When is the last time you had chinese delivered? Exactly! Litterally everything we ordered was fantastic. this is not your average americanized chinese you commonly find in every neighborhood. Its well prepared, flavorful and nice portions, The price is right also. dont hesitate to stop in for a bite or even if you dare, call for delivery!

5 stars
If you're looking for 50's Chinese dishes, and we were, this is the place!  It's clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious! The sizzling rice soup tasted just like some of our favorite places in from the past!

5 stars
This is our go to when we are in the area.  In fact, we plan trips to Allen around lunchtime, so we can eat here.  Everything we've tried is amazing, and we always try to get Hot & Sour soup to take home.  Blow the soup before eating, because it is very hot.  I cannot say enough good things about this place.

5 stars
Still a great place for Chinese. Dining room is now back. Order to go often here. Place has been in this shopping center for a long time and across the street from pep boys

5 stars
I have been coming here for over 15 years! It's been a family favorite! The staff is always friendly and personable! I love coming here and talking with everyone! 

I love that my husband can eat some of his favorite traditional Chinese dishes and I can have my shredded pork and garlic sauce! I'm also a big fan of their soups! If you have a cold or need something to warm your soul I could suggest the chicken noodle soup! It's so delicious! 

If you're in the area stop by and try this restaurant!!!

5 stars
Delicious authentic food, I especially love their Chop Suey - absolutely a must try for everyone!

4 stars
I have been coming to this place my whole life. Like actually, they have been open for my whole 22 years of living! The owners are so friendly and have known me and my family since I was little.

I love the food because it's more authentic than others places. I always get the same thing when I come here, but I rarely get tired of eating it. I always the the green beans with chicken, pork dish with shredded tofu, tofu and vegetables dish,  and hot and sour soup. The prices are reasonable and portions are hefty. 

It's a super casual place, but the owners are just the nicest and dish out some good Chinese food.

4 stars
Decided to try this place since it's right around the corner from us so ordered some takeout. Nice little spot and not very busy just yet. (There was no one there when I went around 6:45). They had the food prepared in the timeframe they said and it was still hot when I got home. The food was super fresh and flavorful. Overall pleasantly surprised and would try it again and maybe sit eat in to enjoy it more.

5 stars
I come to this small restaurant for affordable, fast, fresh and flavorful comfort food. I usually have the potstickers and chicken chop suey. I love the fresh tastes and textures of the vegetables and meats, and the portions are very generous. I always plan to take some home, but always finish everything!

5 stars
BEST Hunan/Chinese Cuisine I've ever had. Like y'all, that egg drop soup is LITERALLY the most flavorful, fresh, home cooked soup I've tried. The dishes I've tried are always so incredible! Lots of flavor in their dishes. Tastes very fresh. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Legit tastes homemade. Typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere but the food is ten times better than the generic crap we see way too often! I drive from Dallas, about 30 minutes, out of my way to eat here.

3 stars
I came for lunch on a weekday, but decided to not get the lunch special. Had a small sweet and sour soup, fish filet in black bean sauce, and spicy fried chicken. It came with either fried or white rice. The rice portion is pretty decent. The fish filet was really good and good portions. The spicy fried chicken was a little too saucy and not enough meat. The sauce was drowning the meat, and it was more of a soup. The hot and sour soup had big chunks of veggies that I wish were chopped smaller. Overall the food itself was pretty good and the price was average. If you're looking to get the best value definitely go with the lunch special. The food here is not quite Panda Express, but it's no where near an authentic Chinese restaurant. It's a classic American Chinese place, but the lack of authentic options is what makes it a 3 star for me.

1 stars
Food was tasteless. definitely don't order the pork Lo mein it was horrible. Egg rolls didn't have any meat. Sesame chicken and general tso's had no flavor they messed up my order and gave me the wrong soup crab rangoons are burnt. And when I asked for duck sauce for the egg rolls they told me they had the red sauce but didn't offer duck sauce. Will not be going back

5 stars
Have been going to this same restaurant for over 15 years. Delicious food, family run, and good prices, make this place a hole in the wall gem everyone should try at least once!

Large portions, and thought they followed good hygiene protocol, but most recent order had hair in it. Won't be going back.

5 stars
Great service, amazing food! 

Everytime I order from here the food is amazing. I tell all my friends about this place

5 stars
This restaurant has been around for 25+ years. Although ownership has changed, the food is still tasty and consistent. 

There are certain go-to dishes I would order from here, but really, all dishes are good choices depending on your preferences. This place still has 90's decor charm and the style is reminiscent of my childhood. The nostalgia hits hard, and I love the ability to revisit memory lane.

The service is quick, with a waitress coming around to refill waters and ensure all your needs are met. The dishes come in large portions, often enough for leftovers. The prices have increased due to economic inflation.

If you're looking for a no-frills Chinese restaurant with good food, large portions, and an easily accessible location, check out Little Hunan of Plano!

4 stars
First time trying this place. The food is reasonably priced, the staff are nice, and the food is decent. The Mongolian beef was tasty with the fried rice and the hot and sour soup was good. Unfortunately my lo mein lacked flavor and was under salted so it tasted pretty bland. Other than that, I'd be happy to try a new dish next time.

5 stars
The food is so good. The service was super fast . The ambiance was like your regular mom and pop restaurant.

I have been Loving this place for 30 years !!!  My daughter was eating the moo goo gai pan in a high chair and at 27 she still want to eat that for dinner.   Just not in a high chair.

Food is always delicious in resteraunt and delivered.  The spicey garlic shrimp is exceptional!

5 stars
Food is yummy and very filling. The owner is super kind and this is the type of small business that should be supported! Family friendly and the inside is peaceful and allows you to enjoy a meal with some natural lighting too.

5 stars
My favorite Chinese food restaurant of all time. I grew up in Plano but live in Atlanta now. Every time I come back to visit, Little Hunan is a must-go. If you're looking for the best food, it doesn't get better than this place. The family that owns it are so nice and authentic. Give it a try. It's the best kept secret in DFW in my humble opinion.

4 stars
Their cashew chicken is delicious. Fast service. Authentic AF. 

Also their lunch special is pretty good.

4 stars
In the quest for Friday night Chinese food, specifically hot and sour soup in Plano. 
This was excellent. The Hot and Sour was unreal...full of peas and very rich and hearty. The wonton soup was clean and delicious. The king shrimp was incredible, and the fried chicken was excellent. Of all things, the white rice was bland and overcooked.

5 stars
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The chicken and shrimp spring roll was fresh and chock full of meat.  The wonton soup is the best that I have eaten in a long time.  Ordered the garlic fried shrimp and spicy garlic shrimp.  Absolutely fantastic, plentiful, and fresh food.  Service is solid and food as well.

This will be my go to spot going forward

5 stars
This is still the best. 
I lived in the area from 99 to about 2010
This was our go to place. It made me so happy to see the same family running the restaurant.

Sting bean beef and chicken still the best.
Thank you

The menu could be more informative so first timers know exactly what vegetables are in the dishes.  Food service was very attentive and the restaurant was very clean.  We easily made two meals from our individual servings.

Dinner special spicy fried chicken. It's good. Fast to go service.                          Great prices.

5 stars
Mapo tofu is my favorite here. Their portions are big. Called in for take out and they're straight to the point I appreciate how easy/fast it was. They accidentally mixed up my order with another person who already left with it, but they came back and it was fine. Just a good Chinese restaurant overall

2 stars
Flavorless. Great customer service but the food is a hard pass. Literally no flavor in the sauces. Four different dishes and not one was saved for leftovers. The Crab Rangoon had zero crab and should have been called onion Rangoon. Extremely disappointed. Will not eat here again.

5 stars
Listen. This place is REALLY good. I am Chinese so you better read up on this review. 

I came with my mom today. And here's the thing - there are NO chinese restaurants around town that we've found that appeases my mom. NONE. We came here for lunch, and as we ate, I took small glances at her and I saw her nodding, and saying "This is good."

MY MOM SAID THIS PLACE IS GOOD. SHE EVEN GAVE HER COMPLIMENTS TO OUR SERVER. 

If you're still hesitant because of the low star rating, well then I don't know what to tell you other than that you're definitely missing out on some really delicious authentic Chinese comfort food. It's alright though, it'll be your loss.

We only ordered two dishes today. Both were noodle dishes. And WE ALREADY KNOW WE'LL BE COMING BACK. THEY WERE DELICIOUS, and here's why:

The Lo mein - they didn't skimp out on the protein/toppings AT ALL. We ordered combo and there were lots of pieces of pork, shrimp, and chicken. YUM!! I'm craving it as I'm typing this! Even better is the fact that the food came out STEAMING HOT. THEY USED A WOK AND ITS OBVIOUS FROM THE AUTHENTIC TASTE AND FRESHNESS! THIS IS AS TRADITIONAL AS IT'LL GET FOLKS. 

The beef noodle soup - DELICIOUS!!! The meats were so tender and they didn't skimp out on the meats or bok choi either. Broth was simple and tasted clean. You're gonna tell me it'a tasteless?? Naw go get your tastebuds checked. 

Each dish tasted clean, fresh, and very authentic. The portions were HUGE! Even just between my mom and I, we were still able to pack half of each dish to go, allowing us to get 2 meals out of them. So worth it. And the meals here are so AFFORDABLE!!! Our total bill was less than $20.

Don't pass on this place. It's really really great. I apologize for the all caps because I really could not contain my excitement about how good this place is!

5 stars
The customer service is fast and the chicken noodle soup is so delicious omg. I never thought I would like it as much as I do. It's a lot of chicken in it as well. Enough for two days worth of food.
