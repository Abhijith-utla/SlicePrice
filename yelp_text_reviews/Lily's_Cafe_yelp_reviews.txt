Once again I found my self trying to go somewhere that didn't work out.
So now I'm on the hunt for something reasonably close by - and I settled on Lily's Cafe.
The food was excellent. 
The service was great. Very attentive.
It's  kind of a small place with a cool vibe.
Definitely will return when back in that area.

This place is not marketed properly. It's marketed as a breakfast/brunch spot but it's more like a Mexican Restaurant that happens to serve food at breakfast time. 

The atmosphere was not uplifting like a breakfast spot should be, it was drab and empty (there were hardly any other patrons dining). The service was friendly but that's about the only good thing here.

The food was not very good. My Dad thought his Breakfast Tacos were just okay. My Tamal Con Elote was incredibly dry and bland (no filling or sauce, just a bland and cold queso dip on the side). 

This place doesn't even serve Iced Coffee or Dairy-Free Options. Considering I had to go to Scooters' afterwards to grab a coffee, and I left starving, I won't be back.

5 stars
Visited Lily's Cafe for the 1st time and was pleasantly surprised!. Great service and the food was fresh, delicious and well worth the money. This is a gem of a place in Plano and can't wait to visit again. The waffles were just the right amount of crisp, the biscuits and gravy were on point and the pancakes were some of the best we ever had.

5 stars
Family-feel restaurant. Service was prompt, and the food was very good. We happened to find it on Yelp and decide to try it. We loved it.

Stopped by for breakfast, first time trying Guatemalan food. The food was very flavorful, attentive service. Highly recommend!

I love this place and the food is so good! It's very unassuming inside and out. I'd come back for sure. First time I came here I had breakfast food and this time I chose other items.

The very best chicken enchiladas I have ever had. And believe me, I've had a lot. Try it.

Lily's for Dinner!!!!!  

Lily's cafe has been a neighborhood gem for breakfast and lunch. They have added a dinner menu and bar. So happy to see!  Take a look at the great reviews and check out the new menu!!

5 stars
We love Lily's for brunch.  The food is consistently good and so is the service.  The Guatemalan breakfast is my preference.  Love the Huevos Rancheros.  The menu is extensive and they now serve alcoholic beverages.  It is light and bright since they remodeled.  It's not fancy, but it is comfortable and good food.

4 stars
Tried it for the first time and it happens to be the grand re-opening.  We were interested in the Guatemalan dishes.  We really enjoyed the plantains and the beans.  The amount of sausage was surprisingly small. But overall the food was good and eaten.   Inside is new and clean.

4 stars
Recently redecorated. New chairs, booths, tables. Bright and welcoming. Expanded hours to include dinner. Menu has more Latin American items. 
Recent visit, service was attentive from Ludin. Food was good and fairly priced. My daughter-in-law from MX and my son love this place. We will go back.

5 stars
After the owner replied to me imploring me to give them another try, I returned. Twice!

Still excellent food. I once again had the plate with Guatemalan chorizo with peppers and onions, queso fresco, Guatemalan cream, black beans, homemade tortillas, eggs, and avocado. Amazing. I also tried the Mexican style chorizo and eggs, black beans, with potatoes requested crispy and YES they did them right. Mom tried a Very Berry Cinnamon French Toast combo (yum) and a West Coast Benedict - excellent benedict sauce and gorgeous avocado and eggs. Everything so good.

And these other two times the service was outstanding. No issues with wait times, attentiveness, or forgetting what we needed. This is definitely going to be a regular brunch spot with mom.

5 stars
Don't overlook this hidden gem in Plano. We have been here many times for breakfast and it never fails to impress. Tonight we decided to give it a try for dinner since they are now open till 9pm. My son chose his normal breakfast order over French toast. The consistency didn't fail with the fluffy French toast and his plate was quickly cleared. My husband chose camarones costa sur. The shrimp were nice and large and perfectly cooked. I chose the empanadas, it came with a nice pickled cabbage salad. The dough was amazing!!! The servers are always so friendly and we leave feeling like we have been at a family member's house.

5 stars
This place is a gem! The food is so,so good!!
I just don't understand how it's so over looked. The people that own it are awesome the food is the best and the prices are very reasonable.

First visit to Lily's Cafe for their grand re-opening and I loved all things about it! Food was delicious and a good portion-size; restaurant environment is welcoming and the staff was very kind. With a refresh to their interior and brand image, Lily's Cafe is definitely worth a try!

Amazing food excellent service. Been redone. Nice, but I miss the old feel. Carne asada is perfect

5 stars
We were there for a weekday breakfast. Place wasn't busy. We were promptly seated.

We ordered the berry french toast with sausage on the side and Huevos Racheros (Guatemala) .

Both of them were amazing. Loved the french toast with syrup and sides were good as well. My wife loved the Huevos Rancheros as well. The beans were vegetarian and tasted really good!

5 stars
We went for a good old fashioned Latin-inspired breakfast. I had a Mexican dish, my friend had a Guatemalan breakfast. Both were delicious with generous portions. Recommend!

5 stars
Love how nice and cozy it was and that they had a menu for the Guatemalan authentic breakfast and then a menu for regular breakfast. The food tasted really good and I would go back again!

Food is amazing. 
Amazing service that we got. My parents are from Guatemala and they love the food and the tamales de elote.

5 stars
Found them randomly looking for breakfast and I'm glad I did! Nice traditional breakfast menu with Guatemalan dishes as well. The huevos con salchichones was delicious, the sausages were nice and salty and paired well with the eggs and sweet plantains. The highlight for me were the thick house-made tortillas, almost as thick as an arepa and delicious. Nice quaint place with awesome, quick service.

5 stars
This place is AWESOME! Service was wonderful and the food is INSANELY good! My husband and I were looking for a good breakfast place and boy did we find it! Needless to say, we will be coming back for lunch and dinner!

Came here to try a Guatemalan brunch. The place is clean, service was fast and staff were polite. We ordered Mollete and Huevos con Salchichones. These dishes are delicious! Coffee refills were offered. Would consider coming back to try  other dishes and their cocktails. I recommend this place.

5 stars

Everything has gone well went 3 times and has never disappointed. From appetizers,drinks, and service highly recommend.

Nice unassuming place to grab breakfast or lunch.  The pancakes were good and my husband said his mug as were similar to how his grandma made them.  Servers were friendly and kept the coffee cup full.  
If you are not a fan of wind chimes, then beware, there is one that is attached to the door and chimes each time someone enters or exits.

2 stars
We ate here tonight and were the only patrons aside from a woman and 2 kids who appeared to be either related to the waiter or were friends or a girlfriend. Service was slow considering we were the only ones there. My chili relleno was ok , but the poblano pepper seemed soggy. The price was steep considering the small amount of food. My husband's enchiladas were average. The waiter got on his phone and ignored us for at least 10 minutes. We were finished and waiting on our check. The woman's kids got rowdier as time passed and were allowed to run everywhere in the restaurant squealing and making a lot of noise. No effort was made to stop their antics. It felt like we were in a kindergarten class. The waiter got off his phone and came to our table finally. He left with my husband's credit card. Again, he was more interested in the woman than bringing our credit card back to us. They became interested in something on her phone. I don't know how they stay in business if every night goes this way. We won't return.

4 stars
Good migas.  Efficient service. Coffee wasn't great.  Cinnamon french toast was very good too. Would love to come back

3 stars
We finally had a free day so we took the car to the shop to get serviced and decided to try this place out as we hadn't had breakfast yet.

First, I'll start off with the CON(s).

-Wait time was very long to get serviced.  Granted, there seemed to have been some miscommunication between the hostess and the lone waitress (and also the manager?).  Anyway, the hostess was superb in handling all she could handle.  The waitress, at least to me, was anything but.  Didn't even give our table any attention and waited other tables with a smile and jovial conversation.  We saw tables (plural, at least 3 or 4) come in AFTER us and finish getting their food and eating BEFORE us.

The PROs.

-Food was okay and not overpriced.
-The hostess was and maintained very courteous attitude and repeatedly apologized for the wait.

Takeaways and advice.  I've worked in the restaurant business for at least 5 years in the early parts of my career.  I've done it all (kitchen, cashier, waiter, bus service, stocking, etc).  We tried this place because the 4.5 stars but clearly it seems that there's a bunch of loyalist reviewers or maybe even friends/family of the business giving high marks.  That or maybe there was change of ownership at some point.  Whatever case it may be, you've got to do better.  Hire more staff.  Maybe, as the supposed manager of this place, ask if we've been helped or not as a preemptive strike against any miscommunication and you might find that it actually will clarify things splendidly.

1 stars
Wow. I will not ever go back. '0' if that were a
an option.  Why? Because Lily said not to.  
We had Lily as our waitress. She did a wonderful job. She was right on top of everything. No complaints. Seated us immediately, in great seats, brought our drinks and food right away. The food was delicious. Neither of us had any complaints. I tried a dish off the menu insert called Tamal con Elote. My friend had Huevos Rancheros with hash browns 
So what's the problem you ask?  Actually the same as on our last visit and then some! When we paid they mixed up our checks, put my check on her credit card and vice versa so what happened this time? ...? 
My credit card was charged for her meal. This time she paid cash to help her keep them separate. So that didn't help Another problem, my bill was $8.81. Hers was $12.94. She should have received $7.06. ( She received $7).  Then my card was charged $12.94. Wow.
If Lily had simply said 'I'm so sorry, let me fix that! I don't know how I did that again' or something along those lines then I would be giving 5 stars and would have left a nice tip.instead. She made a scene- saying she didn't mess them up, we must have.  (Right, that's what happened when we read our bills) We reminded her that this happened to us before, that's the reason one of us paid cash this time. She continued ranting she did no wrong by raising her voice at my friend and telling her if she posts on google that she better not say she messed it up.  Yada yada yada. Then tells us she is Lily and she doesn't want us to ever come back

Bottomless coffee.

Food was awesome. Second time visiting. First was so so but this time was much better. The lighting was perfect for my husband and I and the food was better than State and Allen. They remind me of each other 
Server was Michael. Spoke kind of low but was overall kind. French toasts was a bit too dark but the carmelized sugar was perfect ! Cranberry mimosa was the perfect finish. 
Definitely recommend!

5 stars
Wow!! A plus service! Tex-Mex Breakfast all day!  Friendly people!  Even if you don't like Tex-Mex, they American traditional plates too.  
I'm very impressed by the genuine nature of the waiter, and knew a lot about the ingredients in the dishes.  
I'll definitely be back to try more dishes and after I walk next door to mudleaf

My girlfriend and I moved to Plano almost 6 years ago. We've been coming to Lily's cafe once every couple months ever since. We order off the Guatemalan food menu regularly. The food has been consistently good. The service has always been good. We will definitely continue to make Lily's a regular breakfast spot for us!

5 stars
I ordered the American skillet and it was delicious and filling. The coffee was great as well as the service. Will make this our go to breakfast place for sure. Big menu with a lot of options.

I ordered the huevos rancheros Guatemalan style. Two over medium eggs served with a red chile sauce that had a bit of heat with some peppers and sour cream on the side. It also came with refried black beans, a piece of queso fresco and some Guatemalan style homemade tortillas. It was delicious and very filling! Very quick service and the coffee was fantastic!

5 stars

Simply Delicious.

I got the coupon with the news that the dine-in reopened, I came to have brunch on Saturday. People sparsely seated by wait staffs who wore face masks but there's more of a help than a hindrance getting orders from and serving food to the clientele. 

In this homey restaurant, table covered with flower printed vinyls, old enough plates, dingy light fixtures, weird table located, but the food was good enough even though very plain dishes such as hash brown and breakfast burritos, and coffee. I am not sure that I was too excited because it was my first dine-in experience in several months, or the food was truly delicious but, I had a great time with my daughter.

1 stars
I went in for breakfast and I was finishing my coffee I brought with me from Panera. We waited over 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. The owner would not serve us and asked us to leave. I was prepared to order food and beverages from her establishment. That was extremely rude. I have never had a problem anywhere else finishing a coffee while I waited to be served. I will never eat there again. I guess my money wasn't good enough. The worst customer service ever!!

1 stars
Been here a few times. Service has typically been slow and food was just "meh." Atmosphere is dark and dingy. Anytime our gang suggests Lily's, I either try to get everyone to go somewhere else, or I pass if they're insistent. 

Won't be back

In this homey restaurant, table covered with flower printed vinyls, old enough plates, dingy light fixtures, weird table located, but the food was good enough even though very plain dishes such as hash brown and breakfast burritos, and coffee. I am not sure that I was too excited because it was my first dine-in experience in several months, or the food was truly delicious but, I had a great time with my daughter.

I went in for breakfast and I was finishing my coffee I brought with me from Panera. We waited over 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. The owner would not serve us and asked us to leave. I was prepared to order food and beverages from her establishment. That was extremely rude. I have never had a problem anywhere else finishing a coffee while I waited to be served. I will never eat there again. I guess my money wasn't good enough. The worst customer service ever!!

1 stars
Been here a few times. Service has typically been slow and food was just "meh." Atmosphere is dark and dingy. Anytime our gang suggests Lily's, I either try to get everyone to go somewhere else, or I pass if they're insistent. 

Won't be back

5 stars
Once again I found my self trying to go somewhere that didn't work out.
So now I'm on the hunt for something reasonably close by - and I settled on Lily's Cafe.
The food was excellent. 
The service was great. Very attentive.
It's  kind of a small place with a cool vibe.
Definitely will return when back in that area.

This place is not marketed properly. It's marketed as a breakfast/brunch spot but it's more like a Mexican Restaurant that happens to serve food at breakfast time. 

The atmosphere was not uplifting like a breakfast spot should be, it was drab and empty (there were hardly any other patrons dining). The service was friendly but that's about the only good thing here.

The food was not very good. My Dad thought his Breakfast Tacos were just okay. My Tamal Con Elote was incredibly dry and bland (no filling or sauce, just a bland and cold queso dip on the side). 

This place doesn't even serve Iced Coffee or Dairy-Free Options. Considering I had to go to Scooters' afterwards to grab a coffee, and I left starving, I won't be back.

5 stars
Visited Lily's Cafe for the 1st time and was pleasantly surprised!. Great service and the food was fresh, delicious and well worth the money. This is a gem of a place in Plano and can't wait to visit again. The waffles were just the right amount of crisp, the biscuits and gravy were on point and the pancakes were some of the best we ever had.

5 stars
Family-feel restaurant. Service was prompt, and the food was very good. We happened to find it on Yelp and decide to try it. We loved it.

Stopped by for breakfast, first time trying Guatemalan food. The food was very flavorful, attentive service. Highly recommend!

I love this place and the food is so good! It's very unassuming inside and out. I'd come back for sure. First time I came here I had breakfast food and this time I chose other items.

The very best chicken enchiladas I have ever had. And believe me, I've had a lot. Try it.

Lily's for Dinner!!!!!  

Lily's cafe has been a neighborhood gem for breakfast and lunch. They have added a dinner menu and bar. So happy to see!  Take a look at the great reviews and check out the new menu!!

5 stars
We love Lily's for brunch.  The food is consistently good and so is the service.  The Guatemalan breakfast is my preference.  Love the Huevos Rancheros.  The menu is extensive and they now serve alcoholic beverages.  It is light and bright since they remodeled.  It's not fancy, but it is comfortable and good food.

4 stars
Tried it for the first time and it happens to be the grand re-opening.  We were interested in the Guatemalan dishes.  We really enjoyed the plantains and the beans.  The amount of sausage was surprisingly small. But overall the food was good and eaten.   Inside is new and clean.

4 stars
Recently redecorated. New chairs, booths, tables. Bright and welcoming. Expanded hours to include dinner. Menu has more Latin American items. 
Recent visit, service was attentive from Ludin. Food was good and fairly priced. My daughter-in-law from MX and my son love this place. We will go back.

5 stars
After the owner replied to me imploring me to give them another try, I returned. Twice!

Still excellent food. I once again had the plate with Guatemalan chorizo with peppers and onions, queso fresco, Guatemalan cream, black beans, homemade tortillas, eggs, and avocado. Amazing. I also tried the Mexican style chorizo and eggs, black beans, with potatoes requested crispy and YES they did them right. Mom tried a Very Berry Cinnamon French Toast combo (yum) and a West Coast Benedict - excellent benedict sauce and gorgeous avocado and eggs. Everything so good.

And these other two times the service was outstanding. No issues with wait times, attentiveness, or forgetting what we needed. This is definitely going to be a regular brunch spot with mom.

5 stars
Don't overlook this hidden gem in Plano. We have been here many times for breakfast and it never fails to impress. Tonight we decided to give it a try for dinner since they are now open till 9pm. My son chose his normal breakfast order over French toast. The consistency didn't fail with the fluffy French toast and his plate was quickly cleared. My husband chose camarones costa sur. The shrimp were nice and large and perfectly cooked. I chose the empanadas, it came with a nice pickled cabbage salad. The dough was amazing!!! The servers are always so friendly and we leave feeling like we have been at a family member's house.

5 stars
This place is a gem! The food is so,so good!!
I just don't understand how it's so over looked. The people that own it are awesome the food is the best and the prices are very reasonable.

First visit to Lily's Cafe for their grand re-opening and I loved all things about it! Food was delicious and a good portion-size; restaurant environment is welcoming and the staff was very kind. With a refresh to their interior and brand image, Lily's Cafe is definitely worth a try!

5 stars
Amazing food excellent service. Been redone. Nice, but I miss the old feel. Carne asada is perfect

5 stars
We were there for a weekday breakfast. Place wasn't busy. We were promptly seated.

We ordered the berry french toast with sausage on the side and Huevos Racheros (Guatemala) .

Both of them were amazing. Loved the french toast with syrup and sides were good as well. My wife loved the Huevos Rancheros as well. The beans were vegetarian and tasted really good!

5 stars
We went for a good old fashioned Latin-inspired breakfast. I had a Mexican dish, my friend had a Guatemalan breakfast. Both were delicious with generous portions. Recommend!

5 stars
Love how nice and cozy it was and that they had a menu for the Guatemalan authentic breakfast and then a menu for regular breakfast. The food tasted really good and I would go back again!

Favorite breakfast spot in Plano. Always good food and good service. 10/10. Their biscuits are amazing.

Food is amazing. 
Amazing service that we got. My parents are from Guatemala and they love the food and the tamales de elote.

5 stars
Found them randomly looking for breakfast and I'm glad I did! Nice traditional breakfast menu with Guatemalan dishes as well. The huevos con salchichones was delicious, the sausages were nice and salty and paired well with the eggs and sweet plantains. The highlight for me were the thick house-made tortillas, almost as thick as an arepa and delicious. Nice quaint place with awesome, quick service.

5 stars
This place is AWESOME! Service was wonderful and the food is INSANELY good! My husband and I were looking for a good breakfast place and boy did we find it! Needless to say, we will be coming back for lunch and dinner!

5 stars
Came here to try a Guatemalan brunch. The place is clean, service was fast and staff were polite. We ordered Mollete and Huevos con Salchichones. These dishes are delicious! Coffee refills were offered. Would consider coming back to try  other dishes and their cocktails. I recommend this place.

5 stars
Great little hidden gem.  Food is delicious, we went for breakfast but will be going back for dinner.  Server was quick and friendly.  This place is a 10 out of 10

5 stars
The food was delicious, the service was great. Everyone enjoyed the meal. Our table ordered a mixture of breakfast and lunch, and we each enjoyed our meal so much. I loved that my favorite breakfast came with some of my favorite extras that I had never thought to add.  It was delicious!

Everything has gone well went 3 times and has never disappointed. From appetizers,drinks, and service highly recommend.

Great Guatemalan food!  What a surprise!  I got the Guatemalan version of huevos ranchers and my son got the the traditional.  Both were great!

4 stars
Nice unassuming place to grab breakfast or lunch.  The pancakes were good and my husband said his mug as were similar to how his grandma made them.  Servers were friendly and kept the coffee cup full.  
If you are not a fan of wind chimes, then beware, there is one that is attached to the door and chimes each time someone enters or exits.

Delicious breakfast and great service!  I love trying new diners/cafes. I'll definitely go back! Ordered huevos rancheros and they were delicious!

We ate here tonight and were the only patrons aside from a woman and 2 kids who appeared to be either related to the waiter or were friends or a girlfriend. Service was slow considering we were the only ones there. My chili relleno was ok , but the poblano pepper seemed soggy. The price was steep considering the small amount of food. My husband's enchiladas were average. The waiter got on his phone and ignored us for at least 10 minutes. We were finished and waiting on our check. The woman's kids got rowdier as time passed and were allowed to run everywhere in the restaurant squealing and making a lot of noise. No effort was made to stop their antics. It felt like we were in a kindergarten class. The waiter got off his phone and came to our table finally. He left with my husband's credit card. Again, he was more interested in the woman than bringing our credit card back to us. They became interested in something on her phone. I don't know how they stay in business if every night goes this way. We won't return.

4 stars
Good migas.  Efficient service. Coffee wasn't great.  Cinnamon french toast was very good too. Would love to come back

3 stars
We finally had a free day so we took the car to the shop to get serviced and decided to try this place out as we hadn't had breakfast yet.

First, I'll start off with the CON(s).

-Wait time was very long to get serviced.  Granted, there seemed to have been some miscommunication between the hostess and the lone waitress (and also the manager?).  Anyway, the hostess was superb in handling all she could handle.  The waitress, at least to me, was anything but.  Didn't even give our table any attention and waited other tables with a smile and jovial conversation.  We saw tables (plural, at least 3 or 4) come in AFTER us and finish getting their food and eating BEFORE us.

The PROs.

-Food was okay and not overpriced.
-The hostess was and maintained very courteous attitude and repeatedly apologized for the wait.

Takeaways and advice.  I've worked in the restaurant business for at least 5 years in the early parts of my career.  I've done it all (kitchen, cashier, waiter, bus service, stocking, etc).  We tried this place because the 4.5 stars but clearly it seems that there's a bunch of loyalist reviewers or maybe even friends/family of the business giving high marks.  That or maybe there was change of ownership at some point.  Whatever case it may be, you've got to do better.  Hire more staff.  Maybe, as the supposed manager of this place, ask if we've been helped or not as a preemptive strike against any miscommunication and you might find that it actually will clarify things splendidly.

1 stars
Wow. I will not ever go back. '0' if that were a
an option.  Why? Because Lily said not to.  
We had Lily as our waitress. She did a wonderful job. She was right on top of everything. No complaints. Seated us immediately, in great seats, brought our drinks and food right away. The food was delicious. Neither of us had any complaints. I tried a dish off the menu insert called Tamal con Elote. My friend had Huevos Rancheros with hash browns 
So what's the problem you ask?  Actually the same as on our last visit and then some! When we paid they mixed up our checks, put my check on her credit card and vice versa so what happened this time? ...? 
My credit card was charged for her meal. This time she paid cash to help her keep them separate. So that didn't help Another problem, my bill was $8.81. Hers was $12.94. She should have received $7.06. ( She received $7).  Then my card was charged $12.94. Wow.
If Lily had simply said 'I'm so sorry, let me fix that! I don't know how I did that again' or something along those lines then I would be giving 5 stars and would have left a nice tip.instead. She made a scene- saying she didn't mess them up, we must have.  (Right, that's what happened when we read our bills) We reminded her that this happened to us before, that's the reason one of us paid cash this time. She continued ranting she did no wrong by raising her voice at my friend and telling her if she posts on google that she better not say she messed it up.  Yada yada yada. Then tells us she is Lily and she doesn't want us to ever come back

Bottomless coffee.

Food was awesome. Second time visiting. First was so so but this time was much better. The lighting was perfect for my husband and I and the food was better than State and Allen. They remind me of each other 
Server was Michael. Spoke kind of low but was overall kind. French toasts was a bit too dark but the carmelized sugar was perfect ! Cranberry mimosa was the perfect finish. 
Definitely recommend!

5 stars
Wow!! A plus service! Tex-Mex Breakfast all day!  Friendly people!  Even if you don't like Tex-Mex, they American traditional plates too.  
I'm very impressed by the genuine nature of the waiter, and knew a lot about the ingredients in the dishes.  
I'll definitely be back to try more dishes and after I walk next door to mudleaf

My girlfriend and I moved to Plano almost 6 years ago. We've been coming to Lily's cafe once every couple months ever since. We order off the Guatemalan food menu regularly. The food has been consistently good. The service has always been good. We will definitely continue to make Lily's a regular breakfast spot for us!

5 stars
I ordered the American skillet and it was delicious and filling. The coffee was great as well as the service. Will make this our go to breakfast place for sure. Big menu with a lot of options.

I ordered the huevos rancheros Guatemalan style. Two over medium eggs served with a red chile sauce that had a bit of heat with some peppers and sour cream on the side. It also came with refried black beans, a piece of queso fresco and some Guatemalan style homemade tortillas. It was delicious and very filling! Very quick service and the coffee was fantastic!

5 stars
This place was delicious! We had the platanos fritos which I highly recommend. We both ordered our meals off of the authentic dish menu and were not disappointed. I can't wait to try more next time.

Wow, what a little gem of a place! We came for breakfast, but we want to come back and try the Guatemalan food. The service was friendly and welcoming, and the breakfast we all ordered was delicious!

I try to avoid leaving bad reviews but todays experience was especially bad that kinda ruined our Sunday. The poor rating is mostly because of the service. Our waiter was inattentive, didn't provide our order as we requested and didn't even refill our coffees. The food was below average as well. It's sad but we won't be coming back to this place again.

Got there at 2:25 sign says open till 3:00. They were closed! Made a special effort and rushed to get there they decided to close early.

Simply Delicious.

I got the coupon with the news that the dine-in reopened, I came to have brunch on Saturday. People sparsely seated by wait staffs who wore face masks but there's more of a help than a hindrance getting orders from and serving food to the clientele. 

In this homey restaurant, table covered with flower printed vinyls, old enough plates, dingy light fixtures, weird table located, but the food was good enough even though very plain dishes such as hash brown and breakfast burritos, and coffee. I am not sure that I was too excited because it was my first dine-in experience in several months, or the food was truly delicious but, I had a great time with my daughter.

This place was delicious! We had the platanos fritos which I highly recommend. We both ordered our meals off of the authentic dish menu and were not disappointed. I can't wait to try more next time.

Wow, what a little gem of a place! We came for breakfast, but we want to come back and try the Guatemalan food. The service was friendly and welcoming, and the breakfast we all ordered was delicious!

I try to avoid leaving bad reviews but todays experience was especially bad that kinda ruined our Sunday. The poor rating is mostly because of the service. Our waiter was inattentive, didn't provide our order as we requested and didn't even refill our coffees. The food was below average as well. It's sad but we won't be coming back to this place again.

Simply Delicious.

I got the coupon with the news that the dine-in reopened, I came to have brunch on Saturday. People sparsely seated by wait staffs who wore face masks but there's more of a help than a hindrance getting orders from and serving food to the clientele. 

In this homey restaurant, table covered with flower printed vinyls, old enough plates, dingy light fixtures, weird table located, but the food was good enough even though very plain dishes such as hash brown and breakfast burritos, and coffee. I am not sure that I was too excited because it was my first dine-in experience in several months, or the food was truly delicious but, I had a great time with my daughter.

1 stars
I went in for breakfast and I was finishing my coffee I brought with me from Panera. We waited over 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. The owner would not serve us and asked us to leave. I was prepared to order food and beverages from her establishment. That was extremely rude. I have never had a problem anywhere else finishing a coffee while I waited to be served. I will never eat there again. I guess my money wasn't good enough. The worst customer service ever!!

1 stars
Been here a few times. Service has typically been slow and food was just "meh." Atmosphere is dark and dingy. Anytime our gang suggests Lily's, I either try to get everyone to go somewhere else, or I pass if they're insistent. 

Won't be back

5 stars
Once again I found my self trying to go somewhere that didn't work out.
So now I'm on the hunt for something reasonably close by - and I settled on Lily's Cafe.
The food was excellent. 
The service was great. Very attentive.
It's  kind of a small place with a cool vibe.
Definitely will return when back in that area.

2 stars
This place is not marketed properly. It's marketed as a breakfast/brunch spot but it's more like a Mexican Restaurant that happens to serve food at breakfast time. 

The atmosphere was not uplifting like a breakfast spot should be, it was drab and empty (there were hardly any other patrons dining). The service was friendly but that's about the only good thing here.

The food was not very good. My Dad thought his Breakfast Tacos were just okay. My Tamal Con Elote was incredibly dry and bland (no filling or sauce, just a bland and cold queso dip on the side). 

This place doesn't even serve Iced Coffee or Dairy-Free Options. Considering I had to go to Scooters' afterwards to grab a coffee, and I left starving, I won't be back.

5 stars
Visited Lily's Cafe for the 1st time and was pleasantly surprised!. Great service and the food was fresh, delicious and well worth the money. This is a gem of a place in Plano and can't wait to visit again. The waffles were just the right amount of crisp, the biscuits and gravy were on point and the pancakes were some of the best we ever had.

5 stars
Family-feel restaurant. Service was prompt, and the food was very good. We happened to find it on Yelp and decide to try it. We loved it.

Stopped by for breakfast, first time trying Guatemalan food. The food was very flavorful, attentive service. Highly recommend!

I love this place and the food is so good! It's very unassuming inside and out. I'd come back for sure. First time I came here I had breakfast food and this time I chose other items.

The very best chicken enchiladas I have ever had. And believe me, I've had a lot. Try it.

Lily's for Dinner!!!!!  

Lily's cafe has been a neighborhood gem for breakfast and lunch. They have added a dinner menu and bar. So happy to see!  Take a look at the great reviews and check out the new menu!!

5 stars
We love Lily's for brunch.  The food is consistently good and so is the service.  The Guatemalan breakfast is my preference.  Love the Huevos Rancheros.  The menu is extensive and they now serve alcoholic beverages.  It is light and bright since they remodeled.  It's not fancy, but it is comfortable and good food.

4 stars
Tried it for the first time and it happens to be the grand re-opening.  We were interested in the Guatemalan dishes.  We really enjoyed the plantains and the beans.  The amount of sausage was surprisingly small. But overall the food was good and eaten.   Inside is new and clean.

4 stars
Recently redecorated. New chairs, booths, tables. Bright and welcoming. Expanded hours to include dinner. Menu has more Latin American items. 
Recent visit, service was attentive from Ludin. Food was good and fairly priced. My daughter-in-law from MX and my son love this place. We will go back.

5 stars
After the owner replied to me imploring me to give them another try, I returned. Twice!

Still excellent food. I once again had the plate with Guatemalan chorizo with peppers and onions, queso fresco, Guatemalan cream, black beans, homemade tortillas, eggs, and avocado. Amazing. I also tried the Mexican style chorizo and eggs, black beans, with potatoes requested crispy and YES they did them right. Mom tried a Very Berry Cinnamon French Toast combo (yum) and a West Coast Benedict - excellent benedict sauce and gorgeous avocado and eggs. Everything so good.

And these other two times the service was outstanding. No issues with wait times, attentiveness, or forgetting what we needed. This is definitely going to be a regular brunch spot with mom.

5 stars
Don't overlook this hidden gem in Plano. We have been here many times for breakfast and it never fails to impress. Tonight we decided to give it a try for dinner since they are now open till 9pm. My son chose his normal breakfast order over French toast. The consistency didn't fail with the fluffy French toast and his plate was quickly cleared. My husband chose camarones costa sur. The shrimp were nice and large and perfectly cooked. I chose the empanadas, it came with a nice pickled cabbage salad. The dough was amazing!!! The servers are always so friendly and we leave feeling like we have been at a family member's house.

5 stars
This place is a gem! The food is so,so good!!
I just don't understand how it's so over looked. The people that own it are awesome the food is the best and the prices are very reasonable.

First visit to Lily's Cafe for their grand re-opening and I loved all things about it! Food was delicious and a good portion-size; restaurant environment is welcoming and the staff was very kind. With a refresh to their interior and brand image, Lily's Cafe is definitely worth a try!

Amazing food excellent service. Been redone. Nice, but I miss the old feel. Carne asada is perfect

5 stars
We were there for a weekday breakfast. Place wasn't busy. We were promptly seated.

We ordered the berry french toast with sausage on the side and Huevos Racheros (Guatemala) .

Both of them were amazing. Loved the french toast with syrup and sides were good as well. My wife loved the Huevos Rancheros as well. The beans were vegetarian and tasted really good!

5 stars
We went for a good old fashioned Latin-inspired breakfast. I had a Mexican dish, my friend had a Guatemalan breakfast. Both were delicious with generous portions. Recommend!

5 stars
Love how nice and cozy it was and that they had a menu for the Guatemalan authentic breakfast and then a menu for regular breakfast. The food tasted really good and I would go back again!

Food is amazing. 
Amazing service that we got. My parents are from Guatemala and they love the food and the tamales de elote.

5 stars
Found them randomly looking for breakfast and I'm glad I did! Nice traditional breakfast menu with Guatemalan dishes as well. The huevos con salchichones was delicious, the sausages were nice and salty and paired well with the eggs and sweet plantains. The highlight for me were the thick house-made tortillas, almost as thick as an arepa and delicious. Nice quaint place with awesome, quick service.

5 stars
This place is AWESOME! Service was wonderful and the food is INSANELY good! My husband and I were looking for a good breakfast place and boy did we find it! Needless to say, we will be coming back for lunch and dinner!

Came here to try a Guatemalan brunch. The place is clean, service was fast and staff were polite. We ordered Mollete and Huevos con Salchichones. These dishes are delicious! Coffee refills were offered. Would consider coming back to try  other dishes and their cocktails. I recommend this place.

5 stars

Everything has gone well went 3 times and has never disappointed. From appetizers,drinks, and service highly recommend.

Nice unassuming place to grab breakfast or lunch.  The pancakes were good and my husband said his mug as were similar to how his grandma made them.  Servers were friendly and kept the coffee cup full.  
If you are not a fan of wind chimes, then beware, there is one that is attached to the door and chimes each time someone enters or exits.

We ate here tonight and were the only patrons aside from a woman and 2 kids who appeared to be either related to the waiter or were friends or a girlfriend. Service was slow considering we were the only ones there. My chili relleno was ok , but the poblano pepper seemed soggy. The price was steep considering the small amount of food. My husband's enchiladas were average. The waiter got on his phone and ignored us for at least 10 minutes. We were finished and waiting on our check. The woman's kids got rowdier as time passed and were allowed to run everywhere in the restaurant squealing and making a lot of noise. No effort was made to stop their antics. It felt like we were in a kindergarten class. The waiter got off his phone and came to our table finally. He left with my husband's credit card. Again, he was more interested in the woman than bringing our credit card back to us. They became interested in something on her phone. I don't know how they stay in business if every night goes this way. We won't return.

4 stars
Good migas.  Efficient service. Coffee wasn't great.  Cinnamon french toast was very good too. Would love to come back

3 stars
We finally had a free day so we took the car to the shop to get serviced and decided to try this place out as we hadn't had breakfast yet.

First, I'll start off with the CON(s).

-Wait time was very long to get serviced.  Granted, there seemed to have been some miscommunication between the hostess and the lone waitress (and also the manager?).  Anyway, the hostess was superb in handling all she could handle.  The waitress, at least to me, was anything but.  Didn't even give our table any attention and waited other tables with a smile and jovial conversation.  We saw tables (plural, at least 3 or 4) come in AFTER us and finish getting their food and eating BEFORE us.

The PROs.

-Food was okay and not overpriced.
-The hostess was and maintained very courteous attitude and repeatedly apologized for the wait.

Takeaways and advice.  I've worked in the restaurant business for at least 5 years in the early parts of my career.  I've done it all (kitchen, cashier, waiter, bus service, stocking, etc).  We tried this place because the 4.5 stars but clearly it seems that there's a bunch of loyalist reviewers or maybe even friends/family of the business giving high marks.  That or maybe there was change of ownership at some point.  Whatever case it may be, you've got to do better.  Hire more staff.  Maybe, as the supposed manager of this place, ask if we've been helped or not as a preemptive strike against any miscommunication and you might find that it actually will clarify things splendidly.

1 stars
Wow. I will not ever go back. '0' if that were a
an option.  Why? Because Lily said not to.  
We had Lily as our waitress. She did a wonderful job. She was right on top of everything. No complaints. Seated us immediately, in great seats, brought our drinks and food right away. The food was delicious. Neither of us had any complaints. I tried a dish off the menu insert called Tamal con Elote. My friend had Huevos Rancheros with hash browns 
So what's the problem you ask?  Actually the same as on our last visit and then some! When we paid they mixed up our checks, put my check on her credit card and vice versa so what happened this time? ...? 
My credit card was charged for her meal. This time she paid cash to help her keep them separate. So that didn't help Another problem, my bill was $8.81. Hers was $12.94. She should have received $7.06. ( She received $7).  Then my card was charged $12.94. Wow.
If Lily had simply said 'I'm so sorry, let me fix that! I don't know how I did that again' or something along those lines then I would be giving 5 stars and would have left a nice tip.instead. She made a scene- saying she didn't mess them up, we must have.  (Right, that's what happened when we read our bills) We reminded her that this happened to us before, that's the reason one of us paid cash this time. She continued ranting she did no wrong by raising her voice at my friend and telling her if she posts on google that she better not say she messed it up.  Yada yada yada. Then tells us she is Lily and she doesn't want us to ever come back

Food was awesome. Second time visiting. First was so so but this time was much better. The lighting was perfect for my husband and I and the food was better than State and Allen. They remind me of each other 
Server was Michael. Spoke kind of low but was overall kind. French toasts was a bit too dark but the carmelized sugar was perfect ! Cranberry mimosa was the perfect finish. 
Definitely recommend!

5 stars
Wow!! A plus service! Tex-Mex Breakfast all day!  Friendly people!  Even if you don't like Tex-Mex, they American traditional plates too.  
I'm very impressed by the genuine nature of the waiter, and knew a lot about the ingredients in the dishes.  
I'll definitely be back to try more dishes and after I walk next door to mudleaf

My girlfriend and I moved to Plano almost 6 years ago. We've been coming to Lily's cafe once every couple months ever since. We order off the Guatemalan food menu regularly. The food has been consistently good. The service has always been good. We will definitely continue to make Lily's a regular breakfast spot for us!

5 stars
I ordered the American skillet and it was delicious and filling. The coffee was great as well as the service. Will make this our go to breakfast place for sure. Big menu with a lot of options.

I ordered the huevos rancheros Guatemalan style. Two over medium eggs served with a red chile sauce that had a bit of heat with some peppers and sour cream on the side. It also came with refried black beans, a piece of queso fresco and some Guatemalan style homemade tortillas. It was delicious and very filling! Very quick service and the coffee was fantastic!

Simply Delicious.

I got the coupon with the news that the dine-in reopened, I came to have brunch on Saturday. People sparsely seated by wait staffs who wore face masks but there's more of a help than a hindrance getting orders from and serving food to the clientele. 

In this homey restaurant, table covered with flower printed vinyls, old enough plates, dingy light fixtures, weird table located, but the food was good enough even though very plain dishes such as hash brown and breakfast burritos, and coffee. I am not sure that I was too excited because it was my first dine-in experience in several months, or the food was truly delicious but, I had a great time with my daughter.

Wow!! A plus service! Tex-Mex Breakfast all day!  Friendly people!  Even if you don't like Tex-Mex, they American traditional plates too.  
I'm very impressed by the genuine nature of the waiter, and knew a lot about the ingredients in the dishes.  
I'll definitely be back to try more dishes and after I walk next door to mudleaf

My girlfriend and I moved to Plano almost 6 years ago. We've been coming to Lily's cafe once every couple months ever since. We order off the Guatemalan food menu regularly. The food has been consistently good. The service has always been good. We will definitely continue to make Lily's a regular breakfast spot for us!

5 stars
I ordered the American skillet and it was delicious and filling. The coffee was great as well as the service. Will make this our go to breakfast place for sure. Big menu with a lot of options.

5 stars
I ordered the huevos rancheros Guatemalan style. Two over medium eggs served with a red chile sauce that had a bit of heat with some peppers and sour cream on the side. It also came with refried black beans, a piece of queso fresco and some Guatemalan style homemade tortillas. It was delicious and very filling! Very quick service and the coffee was fantastic!

5 stars
This place was delicious! We had the platanos fritos which I highly recommend. We both ordered our meals off of the authentic dish menu and were not disappointed. I can't wait to try more next time.

5 stars
Wow, what a little gem of a place! We came for breakfast, but we want to come back and try the Guatemalan food. The service was friendly and welcoming, and the breakfast we all ordered was delicious!

I try to avoid leaving bad reviews but todays experience was especially bad that kinda ruined our Sunday. The poor rating is mostly because of the service. Our waiter was inattentive, didn't provide our order as we requested and didn't even refill our coffees. The food was below average as well. It's sad but we won't be coming back to this place again.

Got there at 2:25 sign says open till 3:00. They were closed! Made a special effort and rushed to get there they decided to close early.

Simply Delicious.

I got the coupon with the news that the dine-in reopened, I came to have brunch on Saturday. People sparsely seated by wait staffs who wore face masks but there's more of a help than a hindrance getting orders from and serving food to the clientele. 

In this homey restaurant, table covered with flower printed vinyls, old enough plates, dingy light fixtures, weird table located, but the food was good enough even though very plain dishes such as hash brown and breakfast burritos, and coffee. I am not sure that I was too excited because it was my first dine-in experience in several months, or the food was truly delicious but, I had a great time with my daughter.

1 stars
I went in for breakfast and I was finishing my coffee I brought with me from Panera. We waited over 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. The owner would not serve us and asked us to leave. I was prepared to order food and beverages from her establishment. That was extremely rude. I have never had a problem anywhere else finishing a coffee while I waited to be served. I will never eat there again. I guess my money wasn't good enough. The worst customer service ever!!

1 stars
Been here a few times. Service has typically been slow and food was just "meh." Atmosphere is dark and dingy. Anytime our gang suggests Lily's, I either try to get everyone to go somewhere else, or I pass if they're insistent. 

Won't be back

5 stars
Once again I found my self trying to go somewhere that didn't work out.
So now I'm on the hunt for something reasonably close by - and I settled on Lily's Cafe.
The food was excellent. 
The service was great. Very attentive.
It's  kind of a small place with a cool vibe.
Definitely will return when back in that area.

2 stars
This place is not marketed properly. It's marketed as a breakfast/brunch spot but it's more like a Mexican Restaurant that happens to serve food at breakfast time. 

The atmosphere was not uplifting like a breakfast spot should be, it was drab and empty (there were hardly any other patrons dining). The service was friendly but that's about the only good thing here.

The food was not very good. My Dad thought his Breakfast Tacos were just okay. My Tamal Con Elote was incredibly dry and bland (no filling or sauce, just a bland and cold queso dip on the side). 

This place doesn't even serve Iced Coffee or Dairy-Free Options. Considering I had to go to Scooters' afterwards to grab a coffee, and I left starving, I won't be back.

5 stars
Visited Lily's Cafe for the 1st time and was pleasantly surprised!. Great service and the food was fresh, delicious and well worth the money. This is a gem of a place in Plano and can't wait to visit again. The waffles were just the right amount of crisp, the biscuits and gravy were on point and the pancakes were some of the best we ever had.

5 stars
Family-feel restaurant. Service was prompt, and the food was very good. We happened to find it on Yelp and decide to try it. We loved it.

Lily's for Dinner!!!!!  

Lily's cafe has been a neighborhood gem for breakfast and lunch. They have added a dinner menu and bar. So happy to see!  Take a look at the great reviews and check out the new menu!!

5 stars
We love Lily's for brunch.  The food is consistently good and so is the service.  The Guatemalan breakfast is my preference.  Love the Huevos Rancheros.  The menu is extensive and they now serve alcoholic beverages.  It is light and bright since they remodeled.  It's not fancy, but it is comfortable and good food.

4 stars
Tried it for the first time and it happens to be the grand re-opening.  We were interested in the Guatemalan dishes.  We really enjoyed the plantains and the beans.  The amount of sausage was surprisingly small. But overall the food was good and eaten.   Inside is new and clean.

4 stars
Recently redecorated. New chairs, booths, tables. Bright and welcoming. Expanded hours to include dinner. Menu has more Latin American items. 
Recent visit, service was attentive from Ludin. Food was good and fairly priced. My daughter-in-law from MX and my son love this place. We will go back.

5 stars
After the owner replied to me imploring me to give them another try, I returned. Twice!

Still excellent food. I once again had the plate with Guatemalan chorizo with peppers and onions, queso fresco, Guatemalan cream, black beans, homemade tortillas, eggs, and avocado. Amazing. I also tried the Mexican style chorizo and eggs, black beans, with potatoes requested crispy and YES they did them right. Mom tried a Very Berry Cinnamon French Toast combo (yum) and a West Coast Benedict - excellent benedict sauce and gorgeous avocado and eggs. Everything so good.

And these other two times the service was outstanding. No issues with wait times, attentiveness, or forgetting what we needed. This is definitely going to be a regular brunch spot with mom.

5 stars
Don't overlook this hidden gem in Plano. We have been here many times for breakfast and it never fails to impress. Tonight we decided to give it a try for dinner since they are now open till 9pm. My son chose his normal breakfast order over French toast. The consistency didn't fail with the fluffy French toast and his plate was quickly cleared. My husband chose camarones costa sur. The shrimp were nice and large and perfectly cooked. I chose the empanadas, it came with a nice pickled cabbage salad. The dough was amazing!!! The servers are always so friendly and we leave feeling like we have been at a family member's house.

5 stars
This place is a gem! The food is so,so good!!
I just don't understand how it's so over looked. The people that own it are awesome the food is the best and the prices are very reasonable.

First visit to Lily's Cafe for their grand re-opening and I loved all things about it! Food was delicious and a good portion-size; restaurant environment is welcoming and the staff was very kind. With a refresh to their interior and brand image, Lily's Cafe is definitely worth a try!

Amazing food excellent service. Been redone. Nice, but I miss the old feel. Carne asada is perfect

5 stars
We were there for a weekday breakfast. Place wasn't busy. We were promptly seated.

We ordered the berry french toast with sausage on the side and Huevos Racheros (Guatemala) .

Both of them were amazing. Loved the french toast with syrup and sides were good as well. My wife loved the Huevos Rancheros as well. The beans were vegetarian and tasted really good!

5 stars
We went for a good old fashioned Latin-inspired breakfast. I had a Mexican dish, my friend had a Guatemalan breakfast. Both were delicious with generous portions. Recommend!

5 stars
Love how nice and cozy it was and that they had a menu for the Guatemalan authentic breakfast and then a menu for regular breakfast. The food tasted really good and I would go back again!

Food is amazing. 
Amazing service that we got. My parents are from Guatemala and they love the food and the tamales de elote.

5 stars
Found them randomly looking for breakfast and I'm glad I did! Nice traditional breakfast menu with Guatemalan dishes as well. The huevos con salchichones was delicious, the sausages were nice and salty and paired well with the eggs and sweet plantains. The highlight for me were the thick house-made tortillas, almost as thick as an arepa and delicious. Nice quaint place with awesome, quick service.

5 stars
This place is AWESOME! Service was wonderful and the food is INSANELY good! My husband and I were looking for a good breakfast place and boy did we find it! Needless to say, we will be coming back for lunch and dinner!

Came here to try a Guatemalan brunch. The place is clean, service was fast and staff were polite. We ordered Mollete and Huevos con Salchichones. These dishes are delicious! Coffee refills were offered. Would consider coming back to try  other dishes and their cocktails. I recommend this place.

Nice unassuming place to grab breakfast or lunch.  The pancakes were good and my husband said his mug as were similar to how his grandma made them.  Servers were friendly and kept the coffee cup full.  
If you are not a fan of wind chimes, then beware, there is one that is attached to the door and chimes each time someone enters or exits.

We ate here tonight and were the only patrons aside from a woman and 2 kids who appeared to be either related to the waiter or were friends or a girlfriend. Service was slow considering we were the only ones there. My chili relleno was ok , but the poblano pepper seemed soggy. The price was steep considering the small amount of food. My husband's enchiladas were average. The waiter got on his phone and ignored us for at least 10 minutes. We were finished and waiting on our check. The woman's kids got rowdier as time passed and were allowed to run everywhere in the restaurant squealing and making a lot of noise. No effort was made to stop their antics. It felt like we were in a kindergarten class. The waiter got off his phone and came to our table finally. He left with my husband's credit card. Again, he was more interested in the woman than bringing our credit card back to us. They became interested in something on her phone. I don't know how they stay in business if every night goes this way. We won't return.

4 stars
Good migas.  Efficient service. Coffee wasn't great.  Cinnamon french toast was very good too. Would love to come back

We finally had a free day so we took the car to the shop to get serviced and decided to try this place out as we hadn't had breakfast yet.

First, I'll start off with the CON(s).

-Wait time was very long to get serviced.  Granted, there seemed to have been some miscommunication between the hostess and the lone waitress (and also the manager?).  Anyway, the hostess was superb in handling all she could handle.  The waitress, at least to me, was anything but.  Didn't even give our table any attention and waited other tables with a smile and jovial conversation.  We saw tables (plural, at least 3 or 4) come in AFTER us and finish getting their food and eating BEFORE us.

The PROs.

-Food was okay and not overpriced.
-The hostess was and maintained very courteous attitude and repeatedly apologized for the wait.

Takeaways and advice.  I've worked in the restaurant business for at least 5 years in the early parts of my career.  I've done it all (kitchen, cashier, waiter, bus service, stocking, etc).  We tried this place because the 4.5 stars but clearly it seems that there's a bunch of loyalist reviewers or maybe even friends/family of the business giving high marks.  That or maybe there was change of ownership at some point.  Whatever case it may be, you've got to do better.  Hire more staff.  Maybe, as the supposed manager of this place, ask if we've been helped or not as a preemptive strike against any miscommunication and you might find that it actually will clarify things splendidly.

1 stars
Wow. I will not ever go back. '0' if that were a
an option.  Why? Because Lily said not to.  
We had Lily as our waitress. She did a wonderful job. She was right on top of everything. No complaints. Seated us immediately, in great seats, brought our drinks and food right away. The food was delicious. Neither of us had any complaints. I tried a dish off the menu insert called Tamal con Elote. My friend had Huevos Rancheros with hash browns 
So what's the problem you ask?  Actually the same as on our last visit and then some! When we paid they mixed up our checks, put my check on her credit card and vice versa so what happened this time? ...? 
My credit card was charged for her meal. This time she paid cash to help her keep them separate. So that didn't help Another problem, my bill was $8.81. Hers was $12.94. She should have received $7.06. ( She received $7).  Then my card was charged $12.94. Wow.
If Lily had simply said 'I'm so sorry, let me fix that! I don't know how I did that again' or something along those lines then I would be giving 5 stars and would have left a nice tip.instead. She made a scene- saying she didn't mess them up, we must have.  (Right, that's what happened when we read our bills) We reminded her that this happened to us before, that's the reason one of us paid cash this time. She continued ranting she did no wrong by raising her voice at my friend and telling her if she posts on google that she better not say she messed it up.  Yada yada yada. Then tells us she is Lily and she doesn't want us to ever come back

Bottomless coffee.

Food was awesome. Second time visiting. First was so so but this time was much better. The lighting was perfect for my husband and I and the food was better than State and Allen. They remind me of each other 
Server was Michael. Spoke kind of low but was overall kind. French toasts was a bit too dark but the carmelized sugar was perfect ! Cranberry mimosa was the perfect finish. 
Definitely recommend!

She made a scene- saying she didn't mess them up, we must have.  (Right, that's what happened when we read our bills) We reminded her that this happened to us before, that's the reason one of us paid cash this time. She continued ranting she did no wrong by raising her voice at my friend and telling her if she posts on google that she better not say she messed it up.  Yada yada yada. Then tells us she is Lily and she doesn't want us to ever come back

Good breakfast burritos.

Bottomless coffee.

Try the elote!

Food was awesome. Second time visiting. First was so so but this time was much better. The lighting was perfect for my husband and I and the food was better than State and Allen. They remind me of each other 
Server was Michael. Spoke kind of low but was overall kind. French toasts was a bit too dark but the carmelized sugar was perfect ! Cranberry mimosa was the perfect finish. 
Definitely recommend!

5 stars
Wow!! A plus service! Tex-Mex Breakfast all day!  Friendly people!  Even if you don't like Tex-Mex, they American traditional plates too.  
I'm very impressed by the genuine nature of the waiter, and knew a lot about the ingredients in the dishes.  
I'll definitely be back to try more dishes and after I walk next door to mudleaf

My girlfriend and I moved to Plano almost 6 years ago. We've been coming to Lily's cafe once every couple months ever since. We order off the Guatemalan food menu regularly. The food has been consistently good. The service has always been good. We will definitely continue to make Lily's a regular breakfast spot for us!

5 stars
I ordered the American skillet and it was delicious and filling. The coffee was great as well as the service. Will make this our go to breakfast place for sure. Big menu with a lot of options.

5 stars
I ordered the huevos rancheros Guatemalan style. Two over medium eggs served with a red chile sauce that had a bit of heat with some peppers and sour cream on the side. It also came with refried black beans, a piece of queso fresco and some Guatemalan style homemade tortillas. It was delicious and very filling! Very quick service and the coffee was fantastic!

5 stars
This place was delicious! We had the platanos fritos which I highly recommend. We both ordered our meals off of the authentic dish menu and were not disappointed. I can't wait to try more next time.

5 stars
Wow, what a little gem of a place! We came for breakfast, but we want to come back and try the Guatemalan food. The service was friendly and welcoming, and the breakfast we all ordered was delicious!

2 stars
I try to avoid leaving bad reviews but todays experience was especially bad that kinda ruined our Sunday. The poor rating is mostly because of the service. Our waiter was inattentive, didn't provide our order as we requested and didn't even refill our coffees. The food was below average as well. It's sad but we won't be coming back to this place again.

Got there at 2:25 sign says open till 3:00. They were closed! Made a special effort and rushed to get there they decided to close early.

5 stars
Simply Delicious.

I got the coupon with the news that the dine-in reopened, I came to have brunch on Saturday. People sparsely seated by wait staffs who wore face masks but there's more of a help than a hindrance getting orders from and serving food to the clientele. 

In this homey restaurant, table covered with flower printed vinyls, old enough plates, dingy light fixtures, weird table located, but the food was good enough even though very plain dishes such as hash brown and breakfast burritos, and coffee. I am not sure that I was too excited because it was my first dine-in experience in several months, or the food was truly delicious but, I had a great time with my daughter.

1 stars
I went in for breakfast and I was finishing my coffee I brought with me from Panera. We waited over 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. The owner would not serve us and asked us to leave. I was prepared to order food and beverages from her establishment. That was extremely rude. I have never had a problem anywhere else finishing a coffee while I waited to be served. I will never eat there again. I guess my money wasn't good enough. The worst customer service ever!!

1 stars
Been here a few times. Service has typically been slow and food was just "meh." Atmosphere is dark and dingy. Anytime our gang suggests Lily's, I either try to get everyone to go somewhere else, or I pass if they're insistent. 

Won't be back

5 stars
Once again I found my self trying to go somewhere that didn't work out.
So now I'm on the hunt for something reasonably close by - and I settled on Lily's Cafe.
The food was excellent. 
The service was great. Very attentive.
It's  kind of a small place with a cool vibe.
Definitely will return when back in that area.

2 stars
This place is not marketed properly. It's marketed as a breakfast/brunch spot but it's more like a Mexican Restaurant that happens to serve food at breakfast time. 

The atmosphere was not uplifting like a breakfast spot should be, it was drab and empty (there were hardly any other patrons dining). The service was friendly but that's about the only good thing here.

The food was not very good. My Dad thought his Breakfast Tacos were just okay. My Tamal Con Elote was incredibly dry and bland (no filling or sauce, just a bland and cold queso dip on the side). 

This place doesn't even serve Iced Coffee or Dairy-Free Options. Considering I had to go to Scooters' afterwards to grab a coffee, and I left starving, I won't be back.

5 stars
Visited Lily's Cafe for the 1st time and was pleasantly surprised!. Great service and the food was fresh, delicious and well worth the money. This is a gem of a place in Plano and can't wait to visit again. The waffles were just the right amount of crisp, the biscuits and gravy were on point and the pancakes were some of the best we ever had.

5 stars
Family-feel restaurant. Service was prompt, and the food was very good. We happened to find it on Yelp and decide to try it. We loved it.

Lily's for Dinner!!!!!  

Lily's cafe has been a neighborhood gem for breakfast and lunch. They have added a dinner menu and bar. So happy to see!  Take a look at the great reviews and check out the new menu!!

5 stars
We love Lily's for brunch.  The food is consistently good and so is the service.  The Guatemalan breakfast is my preference.  Love the Huevos Rancheros.  The menu is extensive and they now serve alcoholic beverages.  It is light and bright since they remodeled.  It's not fancy, but it is comfortable and good food.

4 stars
Tried it for the first time and it happens to be the grand re-opening.  We were interested in the Guatemalan dishes.  We really enjoyed the plantains and the beans.  The amount of sausage was surprisingly small. But overall the food was good and eaten.   Inside is new and clean.

4 stars
Recently redecorated. New chairs, booths, tables. Bright and welcoming. Expanded hours to include dinner. Menu has more Latin American items. 
Recent visit, service was attentive from Ludin. Food was good and fairly priced. My daughter-in-law from MX and my son love this place. We will go back.

5 stars
After the owner replied to me imploring me to give them another try, I returned. Twice!

Still excellent food. I once again had the plate with Guatemalan chorizo with peppers and onions, queso fresco, Guatemalan cream, black beans, homemade tortillas, eggs, and avocado. Amazing. I also tried the Mexican style chorizo and eggs, black beans, with potatoes requested crispy and YES they did them right. Mom tried a Very Berry Cinnamon French Toast combo (yum) and a West Coast Benedict - excellent benedict sauce and gorgeous avocado and eggs. Everything so good.

And these other two times the service was outstanding. No issues with wait times, attentiveness, or forgetting what we needed. This is definitely going to be a regular brunch spot with mom.

5 stars
Don't overlook this hidden gem in Plano. We have been here many times for breakfast and it never fails to impress. Tonight we decided to give it a try for dinner since they are now open till 9pm. My son chose his normal breakfast order over French toast. The consistency didn't fail with the fluffy French toast and his plate was quickly cleared. My husband chose camarones costa sur. The shrimp were nice and large and perfectly cooked. I chose the empanadas, it came with a nice pickled cabbage salad. The dough was amazing!!! The servers are always so friendly and we leave feeling like we have been at a family member's house.

5 stars
This place is a gem! The food is so,so good!!
I just don't understand how it's so over looked. The people that own it are awesome the food is the best and the prices are very reasonable.

First visit to Lily's Cafe for their grand re-opening and I loved all things about it! Food was delicious and a good portion-size; restaurant environment is welcoming and the staff was very kind. With a refresh to their interior and brand image, Lily's Cafe is definitely worth a try!

Amazing food excellent service. Been redone. Nice, but I miss the old feel. Carne asada is perfect

5 stars
We were there for a weekday breakfast. Place wasn't busy. We were promptly seated.

We ordered the berry french toast with sausage on the side and Huevos Racheros (Guatemala) .

Both of them were amazing. Loved the french toast with syrup and sides were good as well. My wife loved the Huevos Rancheros as well. The beans were vegetarian and tasted really good!

5 stars
We went for a good old fashioned Latin-inspired breakfast. I had a Mexican dish, my friend had a Guatemalan breakfast. Both were delicious with generous portions. Recommend!

5 stars
Love how nice and cozy it was and that they had a menu for the Guatemalan authentic breakfast and then a menu for regular breakfast. The food tasted really good and I would go back again!

Food is amazing. 
Amazing service that we got. My parents are from Guatemala and they love the food and the tamales de elote.

5 stars
Found them randomly looking for breakfast and I'm glad I did! Nice traditional breakfast menu with Guatemalan dishes as well. The huevos con salchichones was delicious, the sausages were nice and salty and paired well with the eggs and sweet plantains. The highlight for me were the thick house-made tortillas, almost as thick as an arepa and delicious. Nice quaint place with awesome, quick service.

5 stars
This place is AWESOME! Service was wonderful and the food is INSANELY good! My husband and I were looking for a good breakfast place and boy did we find it! Needless to say, we will be coming back for lunch and dinner!

5 stars
Came here to try a Guatemalan brunch. The place is clean, service was fast and staff were polite. We ordered Mollete and Huevos con Salchichones. These dishes are delicious! Coffee refills were offered. Would consider coming back to try  other dishes and their cocktails. I recommend this place.

Nice unassuming place to grab breakfast or lunch.  The pancakes were good and my husband said his mug as were similar to how his grandma made them.  Servers were friendly and kept the coffee cup full.  
If you are not a fan of wind chimes, then beware, there is one that is attached to the door and chimes each time someone enters or exits.

We ate here tonight and were the only patrons aside from a woman and 2 kids who appeared to be either related to the waiter or were friends or a girlfriend. Service was slow considering we were the only ones there. My chili relleno was ok , but the poblano pepper seemed soggy. The price was steep considering the small amount of food. My husband's enchiladas were average. The waiter got on his phone and ignored us for at least 10 minutes. We were finished and waiting on our check. The woman's kids got rowdier as time passed and were allowed to run everywhere in the restaurant squealing and making a lot of noise. No effort was made to stop their antics. It felt like we were in a kindergarten class. The waiter got off his phone and came to our table finally. He left with my husband's credit card. Again, he was more interested in the woman than bringing our credit card back to us. They became interested in something on her phone. I don't know how they stay in business if every night goes this way. We won't return.

4 stars
Good migas.  Efficient service. Coffee wasn't great.  Cinnamon french toast was very good too. Would love to come back

We finally had a free day so we took the car to the shop to get serviced and decided to try this place out as we hadn't had breakfast yet.

First, I'll start off with the CON(s).

-Wait time was very long to get serviced.  Granted, there seemed to have been some miscommunication between the hostess and the lone waitress (and also the manager?).  Anyway, the hostess was superb in handling all she could handle.  The waitress, at least to me, was anything but.  Didn't even give our table any attention and waited other tables with a smile and jovial conversation.  We saw tables (plural, at least 3 or 4) come in AFTER us and finish getting their food and eating BEFORE us.

The PROs.

-Food was okay and not overpriced.
-The hostess was and maintained very courteous attitude and repeatedly apologized for the wait.

Takeaways and advice.  I've worked in the restaurant business for at least 5 years in the early parts of my career.  I've done it all (kitchen, cashier, waiter, bus service, stocking, etc).  We tried this place because the 4.5 stars but clearly it seems that there's a bunch of loyalist reviewers or maybe even friends/family of the business giving high marks.  That or maybe there was change of ownership at some point.  Whatever case it may be, you've got to do better.  Hire more staff.  Maybe, as the supposed manager of this place, ask if we've been helped or not as a preemptive strike against any miscommunication and you might find that it actually will clarify things splendidly.

1 stars
Wow. I will not ever go back. '0' if that were a
an option.  Why? Because Lily said not to.  
We had Lily as our waitress. She did a wonderful job. She was right on top of everything. No complaints. Seated us immediately, in great seats, brought our drinks and food right away. The food was delicious. Neither of us had any complaints. I tried a dish off the menu insert called Tamal con Elote. My friend had Huevos Rancheros with hash browns 
So what's the problem you ask?  Actually the same as on our last visit and then some! When we paid they mixed up our checks, put my check on her credit card and vice versa so what happened this time? ...? 
My credit card was charged for her meal. This time she paid cash to help her keep them separate. So that didn't help Another problem, my bill was $8.81. Hers was $12.94. She should have received $7.06. ( She received $7).  Then my card was charged $12.94. Wow.
If Lily had simply said 'I'm so sorry, let me fix that! I don't know how I did that again' or something along those lines then I would be giving 5 stars and would have left a nice tip.instead. She made a scene- saying she didn't mess them up, we must have.

That or maybe there was change of ownership at some point.  Whatever case it may be, you've got to do better.  Hire more staff.  Maybe, as the supposed manager of this place, ask if we've been helped or not as a preemptive strike against any miscommunication and you might find that it actually will clarify things splendidly.

Wow. I will not ever go back. '0' if that were a
an option.  Why? Because Lily said not to.  
We had Lily as our waitress. She did a wonderful job. She was right on top of everything. No complaints. Seated us immediately, in great seats, brought our drinks and food right away. The food was delicious. Neither of us had any complaints. I tried a dish off the menu insert called Tamal con Elote. My friend had Huevos Rancheros with hash browns 
So what's the problem you ask?  Actually the same as on our last visit and then some! When we paid they mixed up our checks, put my check on her credit card and vice versa so what happened this time? ...? 
My credit card was charged for her meal. This time she paid cash to help her keep them separate. So that didn't help Another problem, my bill was $8.81. Hers was $12.94. She should have received $7.06. ( She received $7).  Then my card was charged $12.94. Wow.
If Lily had simply said 'I'm so sorry, let me fix that! I don't know how I did that again' or something along those lines then I would be giving 5 stars and would have left a nice tip.instead. She made a scene- saying she didn't mess them up, we must have.  (Right, that's what happened when we read our bills) We reminded her that this happened to us before, that's the reason one of us paid cash this time. She continued ranting she did no wrong by raising her voice at my friend and telling her if she posts on google that she better not say she messed it up.  Yada yada yada. Then tells us she is Lily and she doesn't want us to ever come back

Food was awesome. Second time visiting. First was so so but this time was much better. The lighting was perfect for my husband and I and the food was better than State and Allen. They remind me of each other 
Server was Michael. Spoke kind of low but was overall kind. French toasts was a bit too dark but the carmelized sugar was perfect ! Cranberry mimosa was the perfect finish. 
Definitely recommend!

Wow!! A plus service! Tex-Mex Breakfast all day!  Friendly people!  Even if you don't like Tex-Mex, they American traditional plates too.  
I'm very impressed by the genuine nature of the waiter, and knew a lot about the ingredients in the dishes.  
I'll definitely be back to try more dishes and after I walk next door to mudleaf

My girlfriend and I moved to Plano almost 6 years ago. We've been coming to Lily's cafe once every couple months ever since. We order off the Guatemalan food menu regularly. The food has been consistently good. The service has always been good. We will definitely continue to make Lily's a regular breakfast spot for us!

I ordered the American skillet and it was delicious and filling. The coffee was great as well as the service. Will make this our go to breakfast place for sure. Big menu with a lot of options.

I ordered the huevos rancheros Guatemalan style. Two over medium eggs served with a red chile sauce that had a bit of heat with some peppers and sour cream on the side. It also came with refried black beans, a piece of queso fresco and some Guatemalan style homemade tortillas. It was delicious and very filling! Very quick service and the coffee was fantastic!

This place was delicious! We had the platanos fritos which I highly recommend. We both ordered our meals off of the authentic dish menu and were not disappointed. I can't wait to try more next time.

Wow, what a little gem of a place! We came for breakfast, but we want to come back and try the Guatemalan food. The service was friendly and welcoming, and the breakfast we all ordered was delicious!

I try to avoid leaving bad reviews but todays experience was especially bad that kinda ruined our Sunday. The poor rating is mostly because of the service. Our waiter was inattentive, didn't provide our order as we requested and didn't even refill our coffees. The food was below average as well. It's sad but we won't be coming back to this place again.

Simply Delicious.

I got the coupon with the news that the dine-in reopened, I came to have brunch on Saturday. People sparsely seated by wait staffs who wore face masks but there's more of a help than a hindrance getting orders from and serving food to the clientele. 

In this homey restaurant, table covered with flower printed vinyls, old enough plates, dingy light fixtures, weird table located, but the food was good enough even though very plain dishes such as hash brown and breakfast burritos, and coffee. I am not sure that I was too excited because it was my first dine-in experience in several months, or the food was truly delicious but, I had a great time with my daughter.

I went in for breakfast and I was finishing my coffee I brought with me from Panera. We waited over 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. The owner would not serve us and asked us to leave. I was prepared to order food and beverages from her establishment. That was extremely rude. I have never had a problem anywhere else finishing a coffee while I waited to be served. I will never eat there again. I guess my money wasn't good enough. The worst customer service ever!!

Been here a few times. Service has typically been slow and food was just "meh." Atmosphere is dark and dingy. Anytime our gang suggests Lily's, I either try to get everyone to go somewhere else, or I pass if they're insistent. 

Won't be back
