Amazing food - great service - ambiance very welcoming. The two arcade machines gave me nostalgic memories and the whole family enjoyed them. 

Food is always amazing.  We ordered fried chicken medium spice. It was amazing and flavorful reminds me of desi fried chicken back home.

 The kids loved the chicken tenders. Medium and mild spice. Adding the the bread underneath is genius!!! It absorbed the oil and No complaints from kids about oily fingers. 

The wild wild wings is the show stopper. I have never had these flavors before.  It's a nice balance of spice. They were gone so fast. 

The chicken smashburger!!! wow just wow never thought a cheese burger in chicken patty can be soo good!!!! So unique!!! It's definitely a hidden gem ... 

Overalll 10 out of 10!!!! With such good food I'm Surprised Sal's isn't a more known place. Definitely better than other overhyped Nashville places!! 

Sorry no pictures. The food is devoured so quick.

great place & one of my favorite chicken sandwich in Dallas

Sal's is located in a complex with other restaurants, so they have a lot of parking. The ambiance is casual, and can have a couple of medium-sized groups with one or two large groups. The staff are helpful, and the menu is the fried chicken, chicken sandwich, loaded fries, etc. We got the zinger sandwich (medium level), the loaded fries with the comeback sauce, 2 piece fried chicken, and the chicken cheese skewer platter. 

First off, I absolutely loved the zinger sandwich! I've had it twice now, and I loved it both times. It has the delicious comeback sauce, juicy chicken, some crunch from the cabbage, but not too much - it's awesome! 

The loaded fries are also super yummy! The fries aren't soggy with oil, it's super saucy, and the fried chicken pieces are juicy! I also like that they give pickles on the side. If I'm feeling for some loaded fried chicken fries, I'd come here. 

The 2 piece fried chicken was also good, the chicken was moist inside and went well with the garlic sauce they gave with it. The breading did need a little more seasoning I felt, and the breading did separate from the chicken on some places.

The platter's rice was flavorful and fluffy - two things I always look for in the rice! They also have a delicious cilantro and what taste like yogurt sauce on the side, which was good, too. The chicken kebab was moist and flavorful, too. When it first came to the table, it was cheesy, which went well with the kebab, but when I'd started cooking down, it got kinda tough (the cheese). I've heard people say when you reheat it at home it gets soft again, but didn't try that. 

Also, I love that they have a great selection of sauces; my favorite is their comeback sauce. 

Overall, I'll be back to have their food again!

Sal's is a decent hot chicken spot in Plano. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was solid, but nothing overly special. There are better options in the Dallas area. The chicken was flavorful and crispy and the medium spice level had a nice kick to it. The bun, however got a bit too soggy because the sauce was too thin. The Mac and cheese was not bad and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. Sal's is a good option for hot chicken and will satisfy the craving, but does not rank in the elite tier of hot chicken restaurants in Dallas.

4 stars
Very hot and fresh and delicious. Every bite was crispy and mouthwatering . Would definitely go again

5 stars
Hot chicken spots are found all over the place in the Dallas area.  This is my son and daughter in law's favorite.  We all tried something different and it was delicious.  I tried the medium spice that was almost too hot for me they all did the spicy  and my wife could have had the super spicy she said.  The fries were seasoned and cooked nicely. We have waffle and chicken, I had the waffle sandwich, and sin and wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  It was all terrific my waffle, chicken and slaw combined perfectly and add wing a little syrup to cut the heat is genius.   This family ran business was impeccably clean and service was great.
4.5 for the food, 5 service, and will definitely come back next time we are visiting.  This is the kids "Friday chicken" spot and I can see why.

1 stars
PLS DONT GO HERE the loaded fries are WAYYYY TOO good I am genuinely addicted, idk what they mix in their sauce how they make their chicken so tasty or how their fries are so flavor full but yet soo CRUNCHY and don't even get me started on the coleslaw, I used to hate coleslaw but they some how make it sooo good, i Repeat do not get the loaded fries you will be addicted.

4 stars
I stopped by Sal's this past Friday and ordered the chicken salad (medium heat) and maaaaan! I'm hooked, so hooked I had to try again to see if it was just my imagination, so I ordered the salad and the 4 piece chicken, both medium heat and yeah, it's confirmed.  It's damn good.   Good Job to the peeps at Sal's.

4 stars
Posting again cause we went here again and we just love the sandwiches here! This time, however, we tried the loaded fries which were BOMB!! 
Service was quick and food was amazing just like before!

I love it so much, I drive 27 miles at lunch time to pick it up. Amazing service, delicious food, and the inside of the establishment is cozy.

The chicken tenders were large, but they had more of a panko breading.  I ordered the medium heat level, but I could not decern any spiciness at all.
The french fries were plentiful but flavorless.

4 stars
Came here recently with family visiting us from out of town. It's been a while since we last came here since it's not exactly close.  The food was good so it was nice to see that they've maintained that level of quality. Since we had a big group we got to try a bunch of different things. Fried chicken is really good. Club sandwich is nice but not the Karachi style that I was hoping for. Loaded fries were loaded and Hot chicken sandwich is good as well.

So combine this with keds ice cream adjacent and you have a killer one-two meal combo.

1 stars
They put bread under my three jumbo chicken tenders and i hate bread! Service is slow and takes a long time.

5 stars
Amazing food! The waffles and tender sliders had jalapeño mixed in to make for an amazing sweet and savory bite. The staff is awesome, letting us sample the newer skewers and giving us complementary chai!

4 stars
Service was good and the food was amazing. I had a mild chicken sandwich with fries. It was fresh and tasty. 

Felt a bit grimy as most fried food places do.

5 stars
Omg I went to this spot a third time. That sweet and hot spice mix is sooo addictive. Super clean establishment. Food was so fresh, fully Halal. Cant beat chicken quality and flavor. Will be back again and again

5 stars
Wow what a hidden gem! My friends and I came here after realising pho texas is closed. I love myself a good chicken and waffle and this is definitely one of the better ones I've had!!

Service was fast even though we had about 12 of us walk in at the same time. All of their menu items were great. I would definitely come here again.

5 stars
Ordered through DoorDash and was very pleasantly surprised. Large portion size and so good. We will definitely recommend to others and be back.

3 stars
The service was good here. The hot chicken sandwich was the hot level, but to me it was not terribly hot imo.  The fries were good.  

For a combo at $13.99 I just didn't like the soda cup being small.  The meal price seemed a little high.

4 stars
We were not to be denied. A few days ago went to another hot chicken place but that one is permanently closed now. So rescheduled to come here to try it out. One of three hot chicken places nearby the rest in Dallas/Richardson. Check out photos of interior and food. We got serviced promptly and lots of it. We brought some home as leftovers. Just a few things keep it from 5 stars; no sweetner for ice tea, skimpy napkins (takes too many to clean up), not much for interior decoration. If not ready for hot chicken start with no spice or mild. It takes some getting used to impact on taste buds.

5 stars
Best chicken I've ever eaten, Halal too.Very crispy and moist, delicious sides, comes with a variety of sauces.Choose you spice level upon ordering. Great variety on the menu chicken, sandwiches, chicken & waffles. The staff are very attentive and courteous. I've ordered a 4 piece on several visits, and they often bonus me with 5 pieces

5 stars
Flavorful fried chicken and great ambiance inside with kids play zone . Loved the food and service . For food reviews follow @as.clicks on instagram

5 stars
Been coming here for over a year now and have never been disappointed. The chicken is great, the slaw is great, and the fries are great. One thing to note is that their medium spicy level is more than adequate if you're not experienced in spice.

3 stars
Sorry had to leave because it smells like Sal's hot *ss  in there. The ambience is poor, nothing even close to Hot Chicks Nashville Hot Chicken. And don't make your customers wait while you talk on the phone, that's just being unappreciative.

5 stars
I ordered the 3 tender with fries - hot. Wow. It was very very good. The spice level was great and there was a great sweetness flavor. The fries were hot and crispy, the sauce was delicious as well! The service was great, friendly, and it took a bit to get the food, but it was very fresh so I don't care. It was clearly made when I ordered it and not just sitting under a lamp. 

I will be back, best Nashville Hot Chicken I have had in a long time!

5 stars
Not sure what "authentic" chicken tenders are supposed to taste like, but if these aren't authentic, I like my chicken tenders inauthentic. 

I got the mild ones and they're exactly as described; not very spicy but definitely full of flavor. The chicken was falling apart without me even having to use my knife, and it was very very juicy (see picture for proof). The sauce is very similar to canes sauce but seems to have more of a ketchup/mayonnaise base; it paired very well with the chicken.

Mac and cheese seems to maybe be made using Velveeta cheese (might be wrong). Not the best I've had but still very good. If I could have changed one thing I would have rather had melted cheese on top rather than the bread crumbs.   

The fries were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall this is probably one of the best halal chicken tenders places I've been to. I even tried it on a full stomach and was still very impressed. I look forward to going back and trying the spicy flavors.

5 stars
Came back to see if the place was still great.  Sandwich and fries still made to order.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had it spiced hot.  Fries were perfect too. Try this place!!

4 stars
Came for a weekday lunch. I got the standard Nashville Hot Sandwich (#1). It was delcious. I got Medium Spicy - level 3 of 5 - and it was indeed very spicy. I'm happy to know a place that actually makes them spicy, DFW tends to be very tame on these.

I subtracted one star because the staff lacked any enthusiasm and was very silent. The cash register girl barely spoke and seemed to hide out of sight when no one was waiting to pay. The man who brought me my food set it down without a word, not checking if I needed anything. 

I'm pleased enough by the food I'll come back, but it's disappointing they don't bring a fun attitude too. The original Hattie B's in Nashville is really fun.

3 stars
Sal's hot chicken is located practically next door to Popeye's and across the street from Raising Cane's so I'm very curious how well they do.

I had the chicken n waffles medium heat. Surprisingly the medium heat chicken had a dry powder coat and didn't look at wet and sticky as seen in the photos. That said, it was moist inside so I found it acceptable and medium seemed like an accurate description of the spice level.

It comes with one of the house comeback sauce which is a mayo and Worstershire blend similar to Cane's sauce or whatever other tangy pink blend that most restaurants tend to name after themselves. The sauce was fine but they only give you one for two big chicken strips and a second one is really needed. They charge 50 cents each which is always so offputting to me. I opted to try the honey mustard which is also mayo based as it often unfortunately is--honey mustard dressing is the most misleading named product since Grape Nuts, often containing neither mustard nor honey. Anyway both sauces were typical and adequate but average.

Ketchup bottles are on all the tables and they let you use as much ketchup as you want despite it not being any cheaper than the other condiments we've decided as a society to regress and allow to be treated as a premium. What wasn't on the table was salt and pepper so if you want your fries salty, you're out of luck here. That said, the fries weren't bad anyway but I strain to believe there's no salt in the building.

The waffles are cheddar jalapeño and frankly I wish they weren't. I haven't had hot chicken n waffles in Nashville, Tennessee so I can't speak to the authenticity of these decisions, but subjectively speaking, the cheddar was undetectable and the jalapeño flavor clashed with the chicken's spicy coating. I prefer my waffles to contrast with the chicken and normal or even sourdough would be preferable there. The included maple syrup was fine.

I felt this combo also needed one more thing. I've usually had hot chicken served with dill pickles so I was surprised there weren't any included. I see now on the menu they come with them on the chicken tenders only meals but not with the waffles and that's an odd decision. Also it looks like they don't given you much even then. Again I'm reminded of this awful trend of being selfish what used to be free unlimited condiments everywhere. They're still self serve at Dickey's. It's not like there's a cucumber shortage.

I see Coleslaw on the menu but I can't imagine it's worth the $4 they charge for it. Raising Cane's throw a slaw in their combo boxes. Feels like it should have been included here as well. Then also offer a mac and cheese for $4 and a dessert waffle for $7 and that all just seems overpriced to me when the chicken and waffle combo was already $13 in March 2024 prices and $2 more for a drink. I'm not even a boomer, y'all, but this stuff adds up.

So overall it's average. Popeyes is a better deal. Cane's is still more food for the money. But it's enough different that you might pick it sometimes anyway. If they let you have unlimited sauces and pickles and added slaw to the combos I would promote them. Unfortunately, I imagine that ship has sailed.

5 stars
Boy oh boy, was this delicious! We decided just to split an order of the loaded fries - and they were LOADED!! Crispy, delicious fries covered with their hot chicken, vinegar slaw, comeback sauce, and pickles. Oh my gosh, it was so good!! I'm looking forward to going back sometime for trying other things on the menu......but........I'm going to probably have to order the fries again!!! Service was pretty quick!! This place is worth the stop!!!

4 stars
Honestly this place was absolutely delicious. 
Regarding the food itself- 10/10. One of the best hot chicken places we have eaten at. 

Their sauce is well worth the additional 49 cents each. The pickles are delish, and their chicken is perfect. Not too much, and not too little. 

I ordered 3 tenders + fries. The fries were delicious and the tenders were huge, I only ended up eating 2. Thankfully the meal came with a sauce but I would have bought an additional sauce had I known.  
The reason I give this spot a 4 instead of 5 was service. We said for drink we'd like water and didn't receive cups... also when you're exiting and it's a small place it's nice when you hear a "thank you" from the staff.

4 stars
Tried their chicken sandwhich and I have time say the flavor is there and the sandwhich is pretty big and filling. Only complaint is that I felt the chicken was dry. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for more of a Juicy and soft chicken instead of a dry one. I think if they can find a good way to brine the chicken then it could be really good. The location is okay but kind of hard to see at first if you don't know. The outside doesn't look too special at first but once you go in, it's different then what the outside looks. Located in a grocery store complex at the end of the corner. The Google maps may direct you to the opposite side so make sure you drive to the end and you will see it.

5 stars
Really impressed by their vast menu, tried a lot of items. Really loved the sandwich, fried chicken, BBQ wings, and loaded fries. Delicious food and amazing service!!!

5 stars
Have eaten here before and loved it so decided to return. Purchased the loaded fries and chicken and waffles. Great combination of flavors and textures. Food tasted fresh. Staff was polite and professional. The location has been remodeled since my last visit. Bathrooms were clean. Would return.

Amazing Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Was hot and crispy, slaw, sauce and pickles were amazing. Hot fries were very good also. Our favorite Nashville Hot Chicken is Howdys in Sugar Land Texas but this was just as good.

5 stars
Stunning presentation, perfectly crispy, taste on point, and great price! Definitely a place I'd come back to try the other sandwhiches. We got our 8 piece chicken to go, broiled them a couple hours later..... still PERFECT! See y'all soon!

5 stars
Delicious food and excellent service! I will definitely be coming back soon! I love the zinger sandwich!

5 stars
Sal's is a cozy spot with loads of flavor. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the Zinger was delightful as well. We were so satisfied that we couldn't even manage to try the Hot Chicken & Waffles!

5 stars
Delicious!!! I had the Waff-wich.. hands down it was amazing! 

It's huge, I could barely finish half of it. And I'm a big girl that hadn't eaten all day.. so yeah there's more than enough to share. 

Waffle was cooked perfectly, soft and not too crunchy. The chicken was crispy, tender, juicy and flavorful. You can't go wrong. 

The prices are definitely worth it considering all the food you're getting and how delicious everything was.

Please give this place a shot!!

1 stars
Ordered club sandwich.
This was the worst sandwich
It looked like a tuna sandwich
..Terrible taste...It made my stomach sick...Unfortunately we did take out and was extremely hungry...This should be taken seriously...Never again will we eat there...30$ for us to get sick

4 stars
I would post a photo of the sandwich but I ate it to fast it was delish! Better than anticipated... I Just happen to be in the area place looks relatively new and the sign is NOT impressive but the food was (that's what counts.. Got their signature Nashville Hot Chicken (medium heat) 
Bun was buttery brioche perfectly done, chicken was juicy and cooked just right, batter good crisp not burnt or over greased , the slaw and the sauce was very very good. Overall ingredients tasted fresh and very delicious. I don't really give 5 stars to any fast food place but I would give 4.5 to this place !!! I definitely will be back.

4 stars
This is a solid success story that demonstrates what focusing on what you're good at AND taking customer feedback can do for your restaurant. They're serving up clearly fresh food, with portions that are consistently worth it, and the only concern is when it's not hot enough.

Service here is solid, they cover their bases of knowing the menu, having recommendations and keeping the dining area clean. There has been reports in lapses by the management, but the regular employees keep this place running well. They'll even happily accommodate *reasonable* requests and alterations for you. 

I've tried their menu a few times now, so I certainly can I say I have the full breadth of it, and the chicken remains consistent across items and visits. My only concern is quite literally the spice level, not because of it's inadequacy, but because you literally don't get the same flavor if you order below a Hot. Even the fried chicken becomes a new experience just by asking for the Hot Rub applied on top. If they figured out a way to bring that flavor from their spicier offerings down to the less able of consumers, they'd have their 5 star in the bag.

Fresh out the fryer, this revamp of an admittedly weak Peri-Peri spot found it's groove by switching over to what was really selling, the fried chicken sandwiches. With some more time and heeded advice, I'm sure they'll climb to the top of the DFW Halal scene. If you're spice inclined, definitely check this one out!

2 stars
It smells like old grease , the fries taste like old grease . I ordered the loaded fries . The loaded fries was cold , the sauce was ok and chicken was crispy and warm . The bag which I received my food was greasy . The gloves she used to prepare my food she also used to bag my food. The container was greasy , the fries paper was greasy and the actual bag was greasy . The people were nice .

5 stars
Everything came out so fresh and crispy. You should definitely try the wings! Super juicy and flavorful.

4 stars
Good food, good service, and good clean restaurant. The choices are limited as in fried chicken either in a bun or without with different toppings and sauces.

Having said that the food is cooked fresh and served hot. We got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Loaded Fries. The Loaded Fries are fries on fresh coleslaw topped with chopped fried chicken topped with your choice of sauce. I opted for medium spicy and it still had some heat. The sauce had a good spicy-sweet flavor with a slight tangy flavor. 

Overall a good experience.

5 stars
Great flavor. Great spice. Fresh, juicy chicken tenders. Well crafted chicken sandwiches. Some of the best honey mustard and house sauce we've had. We will be back!

5 stars
Hot Chicken is a new trend and this is definitely a place to try! Sal's Nashville Hot Chicken is located in Plano, TX, corner location and plenty of parking space. The service was quick and our food came out hot and fresh! Very crispy and full of flavor. I had the medium tenders and the heat level was just perfect.  I love spicy food. We also tried the loaded fries and mild tenders. The mild is definitely mild. So if you can't take the heat but want a bit of a spicy kick to the food, mild is your heat level! Overall, very delicious and will be coming back to try the sandwiches! 

Side note: we accidentally messed up and ordered the wrong item. The manager/owner was very kind and gracious and happily corrected it. Wonderful service and staff were super kind!

5 stars
I have been coming here at least once a week since I learned of it about 2 months ago. It's so consistently good every single time. Super spicy and flavorful in the best ways. Highly recommend!!! 

The one thing that will drive me away from places I frequent is inconsistency. THANK YOU for being consistent! Your food is delicious!

3 stars
We came here on a weeknight and tried the waffwich and loaded fries. The waffwich was definitely better and more flavorful. They make the waffles fresh, and I recommend eating that there or the waffles get soggy. We had the medium spice chicken on the waffwich and mild chicken on the loaded fries. The medium was pretty spicy...I'm scared to try the fiery hot. The loaded fries were lackluster and needed more tangier coleslaw and more sauce. Small suggestion for management: I recommend that the lady in the front put her hair in a net while handling other people's food.

5 stars
Ok, Sal's - nicely done. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars - the food is very good, I got the #1 chicken sandwich, fries and a drink combo. The sandwich was great - large piece of chicken, medium heat (just enough to taste it, not enough to regret it) - very surprised by the fries - they were excellent - light, fluffy, great balance between crispy and soft - and a large portion of them!

The kicker for me was the price - just a few dollars too high, but then again, isn't everything right now?! I thought about the chicken and waffles - I'll definitely try those next time. Couple next to me were back for the tenders - they love them! The loaded fries sounded great, but I was by myself and I think those would be best to split with others. 

Ok, so I changed it to 5 stars - I'm not going to let a couple dollars dictate the overall impression of this place - it's really, really good and you have to try it! Be careful of the heat - guy told me he got the hot last time and almost didn't live to regret it - so it's hot! 

Pretty decent lunch crowd for the location - there are so many other options on this Coit/Spring Creek corner - I hope Sal's makes it and keeps on offering a great Nashville Hot Chicken option - it's good.

Been coming here for over a year now and have never been disappointed. The chicken is great, the slaw is great, and the fries are great. One thing to note is that their medium spicy level is more than adequate if you're not experienced in spice.

Sorry had to leave because it smells like Sal's hot *ss  in there. The ambience is poor, nothing even close to Hot Chicks Nashville Hot Chicken. And don't make your customers wait while you talk on the phone, that's just being unappreciative.

I ordered the 3 tender with fries - hot. Wow. It was very very good. The spice level was great and there was a great sweetness flavor. The fries were hot and crispy, the sauce was delicious as well! The service was great, friendly, and it took a bit to get the food, but it was very fresh so I don't care. It was clearly made when I ordered it and not just sitting under a lamp. 

I will be back, best Nashville Hot Chicken I have had in a long time!

5 stars
Not sure what "authentic" chicken tenders are supposed to taste like, but if these aren't authentic, I like my chicken tenders inauthentic. 

I got the mild ones and they're exactly as described; not very spicy but definitely full of flavor. The chicken was falling apart without me even having to use my knife, and it was very very juicy (see picture for proof). The sauce is very similar to canes sauce but seems to have more of a ketchup/mayonnaise base; it paired very well with the chicken.

Mac and cheese seems to maybe be made using Velveeta cheese (might be wrong). Not the best I've had but still very good. If I could have changed one thing I would have rather had melted cheese on top rather than the bread crumbs.   

The fries were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall this is probably one of the best halal chicken tenders places I've been to. I even tried it on a full stomach and was still very impressed. I look forward to going back and trying the spicy flavors.

5 stars
Came back to see if the place was still great.  Sandwich and fries still made to order.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had it spiced hot.  Fries were perfect too. Try this place!!

Came for a weekday lunch. I got the standard Nashville Hot Sandwich (#1). It was delcious. I got Medium Spicy - level 3 of 5 - and it was indeed very spicy. I'm happy to know a place that actually makes them spicy, DFW tends to be very tame on these.

I subtracted one star because the staff lacked any enthusiasm and was very silent. The cash register girl barely spoke and seemed to hide out of sight when no one was waiting to pay. The man who brought me my food set it down without a word, not checking if I needed anything. 

I'm pleased enough by the food I'll come back, but it's disappointing they don't bring a fun attitude too. The original Hattie B's in Nashville is really fun.

Sal's hot chicken is located practically next door to Popeye's and across the street from Raising Cane's so I'm very curious how well they do.

I had the chicken n waffles medium heat. Surprisingly the medium heat chicken had a dry powder coat and didn't look at wet and sticky as seen in the photos. That said, it was moist inside so I found it acceptable and medium seemed like an accurate description of the spice level.

It comes with one of the house comeback sauce which is a mayo and Worstershire blend similar to Cane's sauce or whatever other tangy pink blend that most restaurants tend to name after themselves. The sauce was fine but they only give you one for two big chicken strips and a second one is really needed. They charge 50 cents each which is always so offputting to me. I opted to try the honey mustard which is also mayo based as it often unfortunately is--honey mustard dressing is the most misleading named product since Grape Nuts, often containing neither mustard nor honey. Anyway both sauces were typical and adequate but average.

Ketchup bottles are on all the tables and they let you use as much ketchup as you want despite it not being any cheaper than the other condiments we've decided as a society to regress and allow to be treated as a premium. What wasn't on the table was salt and pepper so if you want your fries salty, you're out of luck here. That said, the fries weren't bad anyway but I strain to believe there's no salt in the building.

The waffles are cheddar jalapeño and frankly I wish they weren't. I haven't had hot chicken n waffles in Nashville, Tennessee so I can't speak to the authenticity of these decisions, but subjectively speaking, the cheddar was undetectable and the jalapeño flavor clashed with the chicken's spicy coating. I prefer my waffles to contrast with the chicken and normal or even sourdough would be preferable there. The included maple syrup was fine.

I felt this combo also needed one more thing. I've usually had hot chicken served with dill pickles so I was surprised there weren't any included. I see now on the menu they come with them on the chicken tenders only meals but not with the waffles and that's an odd decision. Also it looks like they don't given you much even then. Again I'm reminded of this awful trend of being selfish what used to be free unlimited condiments everywhere. They're still self serve at Dickey's. It's not like there's a cucumber shortage.

I see Coleslaw on the menu but I can't imagine it's worth the $4 they charge for it. Raising Cane's throw a slaw in their combo boxes. Feels like it should have been included here as well. Then also offer a mac and cheese for $4 and a dessert waffle for $7 and that all just seems overpriced to me when the chicken and waffle combo was already $13 in March 2024 prices and $2 more for a drink. I'm not even a boomer, y'all, but this stuff adds up.

So overall it's average. Popeyes is a better deal. Cane's is still more food for the money. But it's enough different that you might pick it sometimes anyway. If they let you have unlimited sauces and pickles and added slaw to the combos I would promote them. Unfortunately, I imagine that ship has sailed.

Boy oh boy, was this delicious! We decided just to split an order of the loaded fries - and they were LOADED!! Crispy, delicious fries covered with their hot chicken, vinegar slaw, comeback sauce, and pickles. Oh my gosh, it was so good!! I'm looking forward to going back sometime for trying other things on the menu......but........I'm going to probably have to order the fries again!!! Service was pretty quick!! This place is worth the stop!!!

4 stars
Honestly this place was absolutely delicious. 
Regarding the food itself- 10/10. One of the best hot chicken places we have eaten at. 

Their sauce is well worth the additional 49 cents each. The pickles are delish, and their chicken is perfect. Not too much, and not too little. 

I ordered 3 tenders + fries. The fries were delicious and the tenders were huge, I only ended up eating 2. Thankfully the meal came with a sauce but I would have bought an additional sauce had I known.  
The reason I give this spot a 4 instead of 5 was service. We said for drink we'd like water and didn't receive cups... also when you're exiting and it's a small place it's nice when you hear a "thank you" from the staff.

4 stars
Tried their chicken sandwhich and I have time say the flavor is there and the sandwhich is pretty big and filling. Only complaint is that I felt the chicken was dry. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for more of a Juicy and soft chicken instead of a dry one. I think if they can find a good way to brine the chicken then it could be really good. The location is okay but kind of hard to see at first if you don't know. The outside doesn't look too special at first but once you go in, it's different then what the outside looks. Located in a grocery store complex at the end of the corner. The Google maps may direct you to the opposite side so make sure you drive to the end and you will see it.

Really impressed by their vast menu, tried a lot of items. Really loved the sandwich, fried chicken, BBQ wings, and loaded fries. Delicious food and amazing service!!!

Have eaten here before and loved it so decided to return. Purchased the loaded fries and chicken and waffles. Great combination of flavors and textures. Food tasted fresh. Staff was polite and professional. The location has been remodeled since my last visit. Bathrooms were clean. Would return.

5 stars
Amazing Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Was hot and crispy, slaw, sauce and pickles were amazing. Hot fries were very good also. Our favorite Nashville Hot Chicken is Howdys in Sugar Land Texas but this was just as good.

5 stars
Stunning presentation, perfectly crispy, taste on point, and great price! Definitely a place I'd come back to try the other sandwhiches. We got our 8 piece chicken to go, broiled them a couple hours later..... still PERFECT! See y'all soon!

5 stars
Delicious food and excellent service! I will definitely be coming back soon! I love the zinger sandwich!

5 stars
Sal's is a cozy spot with loads of flavor. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the Zinger was delightful as well. We were so satisfied that we couldn't even manage to try the Hot Chicken & Waffles!

5 stars
Delicious!!! I had the Waff-wich.. hands down it was amazing! 

It's huge, I could barely finish half of it. And I'm a big girl that hadn't eaten all day.. so yeah there's more than enough to share. 

Waffle was cooked perfectly, soft and not too crunchy. The chicken was crispy, tender, juicy and flavorful. You can't go wrong. 

The prices are definitely worth it considering all the food you're getting and how delicious everything was.

Please give this place a shot!!

1 stars
Ordered club sandwich.
This was the worst sandwich
It looked like a tuna sandwich
..Terrible taste...It made my stomach sick...Unfortunately we did take out and was extremely hungry...This should be taken seriously...Never again will we eat there...30$ for us to get sick

4 stars
I would post a photo of the sandwich but I ate it to fast it was delish! Better than anticipated... I Just happen to be in the area place looks relatively new and the sign is NOT impressive but the food was (that's what counts.. Got their signature Nashville Hot Chicken (medium heat) 
Bun was buttery brioche perfectly done, chicken was juicy and cooked just right, batter good crisp not burnt or over greased , the slaw and the sauce was very very good. Overall ingredients tasted fresh and very delicious. I don't really give 5 stars to any fast food place but I would give 4.5 to this place !!! I definitely will be back.

4 stars
This is a solid success story that demonstrates what focusing on what you're good at AND taking customer feedback can do for your restaurant. They're serving up clearly fresh food, with portions that are consistently worth it, and the only concern is when it's not hot enough.

Service here is solid, they cover their bases of knowing the menu, having recommendations and keeping the dining area clean. There has been reports in lapses by the management, but the regular employees keep this place running well. They'll even happily accommodate *reasonable* requests and alterations for you. 

I've tried their menu a few times now, so I certainly can I say I have the full breadth of it, and the chicken remains consistent across items and visits. My only concern is quite literally the spice level, not because of it's inadequacy, but because you literally don't get the same flavor if you order below a Hot. Even the fried chicken becomes a new experience just by asking for the Hot Rub applied on top. If they figured out a way to bring that flavor from their spicier offerings down to the less able of consumers, they'd have their 5 star in the bag.

Fresh out the fryer, this revamp of an admittedly weak Peri-Peri spot found it's groove by switching over to what was really selling, the fried chicken sandwiches. With some more time and heeded advice, I'm sure they'll climb to the top of the DFW Halal scene. If you're spice inclined, definitely check this one out!

2 stars
It smells like old grease , the fries taste like old grease . I ordered the loaded fries . The loaded fries was cold , the sauce was ok and chicken was crispy and warm . The bag which I received my food was greasy . The gloves she used to prepare my food she also used to bag my food. The container was greasy , the fries paper was greasy and the actual bag was greasy . The people were nice .

5 stars
Everything came out so fresh and crispy. You should definitely try the wings! Super juicy and flavorful.

4 stars
Good food, good service, and good clean restaurant. The choices are limited as in fried chicken either in a bun or without with different toppings and sauces.

Having said that the food is cooked fresh and served hot. We got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Loaded Fries. The Loaded Fries are fries on fresh coleslaw topped with chopped fried chicken topped with your choice of sauce. I opted for medium spicy and it still had some heat. The sauce had a good spicy-sweet flavor with a slight tangy flavor. 

Overall a good experience.

5 stars
Great flavor. Great spice. Fresh, juicy chicken tenders. Well crafted chicken sandwiches. Some of the best honey mustard and house sauce we've had. We will be back!

5 stars
Hot Chicken is a new trend and this is definitely a place to try! Sal's Nashville Hot Chicken is located in Plano, TX, corner location and plenty of parking space. The service was quick and our food came out hot and fresh! Very crispy and full of flavor. I had the medium tenders and the heat level was just perfect.  I love spicy food. We also tried the loaded fries and mild tenders. The mild is definitely mild. So if you can't take the heat but want a bit of a spicy kick to the food, mild is your heat level! Overall, very delicious and will be coming back to try the sandwiches! 

Side note: we accidentally messed up and ordered the wrong item. The manager/owner was very kind and gracious and happily corrected it. Wonderful service and staff were super kind!

5 stars
I have been coming here at least once a week since I learned of it about 2 months ago. It's so consistently good every single time. Super spicy and flavorful in the best ways. Highly recommend!!! 

The one thing that will drive me away from places I frequent is inconsistency. THANK YOU for being consistent! Your food is delicious!

3 stars
We came here on a weeknight and tried the waffwich and loaded fries. The waffwich was definitely better and more flavorful. They make the waffles fresh, and I recommend eating that there or the waffles get soggy. We had the medium spice chicken on the waffwich and mild chicken on the loaded fries. The medium was pretty spicy...I'm scared to try the fiery hot. The loaded fries were lackluster and needed more tangier coleslaw and more sauce. Small suggestion for management: I recommend that the lady in the front put her hair in a net while handling other people's food.

5 stars
Ok, Sal's - nicely done. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars - the food is very good, I got the #1 chicken sandwich, fries and a drink combo. The sandwich was great - large piece of chicken, medium heat (just enough to taste it, not enough to regret it) - very surprised by the fries - they were excellent - light, fluffy, great balance between crispy and soft - and a large portion of them!

The kicker for me was the price - just a few dollars too high, but then again, isn't everything right now?! I thought about the chicken and waffles - I'll definitely try those next time. Couple next to me were back for the tenders - they love them! The loaded fries sounded great, but I was by myself and I think those would be best to split with others. 

Ok, so I changed it to 5 stars - I'm not going to let a couple dollars dictate the overall impression of this place - it's really, really good and you have to try it! Be careful of the heat - guy told me he got the hot last time and almost didn't live to regret it - so it's hot! 

Pretty decent lunch crowd for the location - there are so many other options on this Coit/Spring Creek corner - I hope Sal's makes it and keeps on offering a great Nashville Hot Chicken option - it's good.

5 stars
Amazing food - great service - ambiance very welcoming. The two arcade machines gave me nostalgic memories and the whole family enjoyed them. 

Food is always amazing.  We ordered fried chicken medium spice. It was amazing and flavorful reminds me of desi fried chicken back home.

 The kids loved the chicken tenders. Medium and mild spice. Adding the the bread underneath is genius!!! It absorbed the oil and No complaints from kids about oily fingers. 

The wild wild wings is the show stopper. I have never had these flavors before.  It's a nice balance of spice. They were gone so fast. 

The chicken smashburger!!! wow just wow never thought a cheese burger in chicken patty can be soo good!!!! So unique!!! It's definitely a hidden gem ... 

Overalll 10 out of 10!!!! With such good food I'm Surprised Sal's isn't a more known place. Definitely better than other overhyped Nashville places!! 

Sorry no pictures. The food is devoured so quick.

5 stars
great place & one of my favorite chicken sandwich in Dallas

Sal's is located in a complex with other restaurants, so they have a lot of parking. The ambiance is casual, and can have a couple of medium-sized groups with one or two large groups. The staff are helpful, and the menu is the fried chicken, chicken sandwich, loaded fries, etc. We got the zinger sandwich (medium level), the loaded fries with the comeback sauce, 2 piece fried chicken, and the chicken cheese skewer platter. 

First off, I absolutely loved the zinger sandwich! I've had it twice now, and I loved it both times. It has the delicious comeback sauce, juicy chicken, some crunch from the cabbage, but not too much - it's awesome! 

The loaded fries are also super yummy! The fries aren't soggy with oil, it's super saucy, and the fried chicken pieces are juicy! I also like that they give pickles on the side. If I'm feeling for some loaded fried chicken fries, I'd come here. 

The 2 piece fried chicken was also good, the chicken was moist inside and went well with the garlic sauce they gave with it. The breading did need a little more seasoning I felt, and the breading did separate from the chicken on some places.

The platter's rice was flavorful and fluffy - two things I always look for in the rice! They also have a delicious cilantro and what taste like yogurt sauce on the side, which was good, too. The chicken kebab was moist and flavorful, too. When it first came to the table, it was cheesy, which went well with the kebab, but when I'd started cooking down, it got kinda tough (the cheese). I've heard people say when you reheat it at home it gets soft again, but didn't try that. 

Also, I love that they have a great selection of sauces; my favorite is their comeback sauce. 

Overall, I'll be back to have their food again!

4 stars
Sal's is a decent hot chicken spot in Plano. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was solid, but nothing overly special. There are better options in the Dallas area. The chicken was flavorful and crispy and the medium spice level had a nice kick to it. The bun, however got a bit too soggy because the sauce was too thin. The Mac and cheese was not bad and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. Sal's is a good option for hot chicken and will satisfy the craving, but does not rank in the elite tier of hot chicken restaurants in Dallas.

4 stars
Very hot and fresh and delicious. Every bite was crispy and mouthwatering . Would definitely go again

5 stars
Hot chicken spots are found all over the place in the Dallas area.  This is my son and daughter in law's favorite.  We all tried something different and it was delicious.  I tried the medium spice that was almost too hot for me they all did the spicy  and my wife could have had the super spicy she said.  The fries were seasoned and cooked nicely. We have waffle and chicken, I had the waffle sandwich, and sin and wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  It was all terrific my waffle, chicken and slaw combined perfectly and add wing a little syrup to cut the heat is genius.   This family ran business was impeccably clean and service was great.
4.5 for the food, 5 service, and will definitely come back next time we are visiting.  This is the kids "Friday chicken" spot and I can see why.

1 stars
PLS DONT GO HERE the loaded fries are WAYYYY TOO good I am genuinely addicted, idk what they mix in their sauce how they make their chicken so tasty or how their fries are so flavor full but yet soo CRUNCHY and don't even get me started on the coleslaw, I used to hate coleslaw but they some how make it sooo good, i Repeat do not get the loaded fries you will be addicted.

4 stars
I stopped by Sal's this past Friday and ordered the chicken salad (medium heat) and maaaaan! I'm hooked, so hooked I had to try again to see if it was just my imagination, so I ordered the salad and the 4 piece chicken, both medium heat and yeah, it's confirmed.  It's damn good.   Good Job to the peeps at Sal's.

The chicken tenders were large, but they had more of a panko breading.  I ordered the medium heat level, but I could not decern any spiciness at all.
The french fries were plentiful but flavorless.

Came here recently with family visiting us from out of town. It's been a while since we last came here since it's not exactly close.  The food was good so it was nice to see that they've maintained that level of quality. Since we had a big group we got to try a bunch of different things. Fried chicken is really good. Club sandwich is nice but not the Karachi style that I was hoping for. Loaded fries were loaded and Hot chicken sandwich is good as well.

So combine this with keds ice cream adjacent and you have a killer one-two meal combo.

They put bread under my three jumbo chicken tenders and i hate bread! Service is slow and takes a long time.

Amazing food! The waffles and tender sliders had jalapeño mixed in to make for an amazing sweet and savory bite. The staff is awesome, letting us sample the newer skewers and giving us complementary chai!

Service was good and the food was amazing. I had a mild chicken sandwich with fries. It was fresh and tasty. 

Felt a bit grimy as most fried food places do.

Omg I went to this spot a third time. That sweet and hot spice mix is sooo addictive. Super clean establishment. Food was so fresh, fully Halal. Cant beat chicken quality and flavor. Will be back again and again

Wow what a hidden gem! My friends and I came here after realising pho texas is closed. I love myself a good chicken and waffle and this is definitely one of the better ones I've had!!

Service was fast even though we had about 12 of us walk in at the same time. All of their menu items were great. I would definitely come here again.

5 stars
Ordered through DoorDash and was very pleasantly surprised. Large portion size and so good. We will definitely recommend to others and be back.

3 stars
The service was good here. The hot chicken sandwich was the hot level, but to me it was not terribly hot imo.  The fries were good.  

For a combo at $13.99 I just didn't like the soda cup being small.  The meal price seemed a little high.

4 stars
We were not to be denied. A few days ago went to another hot chicken place but that one is permanently closed now. So rescheduled to come here to try it out. One of three hot chicken places nearby the rest in Dallas/Richardson. Check out photos of interior and food. We got serviced promptly and lots of it. We brought some home as leftovers. Just a few things keep it from 5 stars; no sweetner for ice tea, skimpy napkins (takes too many to clean up), not much for interior decoration. If not ready for hot chicken start with no spice or mild. It takes some getting used to impact on taste buds.

Best chicken I've ever eaten, Halal too.Very crispy and moist, delicious sides, comes with a variety of sauces.Choose you spice level upon ordering.

Have eaten here before and loved it so decided to return. Purchased the loaded fries and chicken and waffles. Great combination of flavors and textures. Food tasted fresh. Staff was polite and professional. The location has been remodeled since my last visit. Bathrooms were clean. Would return.

Amazing Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Was hot and crispy, slaw, sauce and pickles were amazing. Hot fries were very good also. Our favorite Nashville Hot Chicken is Howdys in Sugar Land Texas but this was just as good.

5 stars
Stunning presentation, perfectly crispy, taste on point, and great price! Definitely a place I'd come back to try the other sandwhiches. We got our 8 piece chicken to go, broiled them a couple hours later..... still PERFECT! See y'all soon!

Delicious food and excellent service! I will definitely be coming back soon! I love the zinger sandwich!

Sal's is a cozy spot with loads of flavor. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the Zinger was delightful as well. We were so satisfied that we couldn't even manage to try the Hot Chicken & Waffles!

5 stars
Delicious!!! I had the Waff-wich.. hands down it was amazing! 

It's huge, I could barely finish half of it. And I'm a big girl that hadn't eaten all day.. so yeah there's more than enough to share. 

Waffle was cooked perfectly, soft and not too crunchy. The chicken was crispy, tender, juicy and flavorful. You can't go wrong. 

The prices are definitely worth it considering all the food you're getting and how delicious everything was.

Please give this place a shot!!

Ordered club sandwich.
This was the worst sandwich
It looked like a tuna sandwich
..Terrible taste...It made my stomach sick...Unfortunately we did take out and was extremely hungry...This should be taken seriously...Never again will we eat there...30$ for us to get sick

4 stars
I would post a photo of the sandwich but I ate it to fast it was delish! Better than anticipated... I Just happen to be in the area place looks relatively new and the sign is NOT impressive but the food was (that's what counts.. Got their signature Nashville Hot Chicken (medium heat) 
Bun was buttery brioche perfectly done, chicken was juicy and cooked just right, batter good crisp not burnt or over greased , the slaw and the sauce was very very good. Overall ingredients tasted fresh and very delicious. I don't really give 5 stars to any fast food place but I would give 4.5 to this place !!! I definitely will be back.

This is a solid success story that demonstrates what focusing on what you're good at AND taking customer feedback can do for your restaurant. They're serving up clearly fresh food, with portions that are consistently worth it, and the only concern is when it's not hot enough.

Service here is solid, they cover their bases of knowing the menu, having recommendations and keeping the dining area clean. There has been reports in lapses by the management, but the regular employees keep this place running well. They'll even happily accommodate *reasonable* requests and alterations for you. 

I've tried their menu a few times now, so I certainly can I say I have the full breadth of it, and the chicken remains consistent across items and visits. My only concern is quite literally the spice level, not because of it's inadequacy, but because you literally don't get the same flavor if you order below a Hot. Even the fried chicken becomes a new experience just by asking for the Hot Rub applied on top. If they figured out a way to bring that flavor from their spicier offerings down to the less able of consumers, they'd have their 5 star in the bag.

Fresh out the fryer, this revamp of an admittedly weak Peri-Peri spot found it's groove by switching over to what was really selling, the fried chicken sandwiches. With some more time and heeded advice, I'm sure they'll climb to the top of the DFW Halal scene. If you're spice inclined, definitely check this one out!

It smells like old grease , the fries taste like old grease . I ordered the loaded fries . The loaded fries was cold , the sauce was ok and chicken was crispy and warm . The bag which I received my food was greasy . The gloves she used to prepare my food she also used to bag my food. The container was greasy , the fries paper was greasy and the actual bag was greasy . The people were nice .

Everything came out so fresh and crispy. You should definitely try the wings! Super juicy and flavorful.

4 stars
Good food, good service, and good clean restaurant. The choices are limited as in fried chicken either in a bun or without with different toppings and sauces.

Having said that the food is cooked fresh and served hot. We got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Loaded Fries. The Loaded Fries are fries on fresh coleslaw topped with chopped fried chicken topped with your choice of sauce. I opted for medium spicy and it still had some heat. The sauce had a good spicy-sweet flavor with a slight tangy flavor. 

Overall a good experience.

5 stars
Great flavor. Great spice. Fresh, juicy chicken tenders. Well crafted chicken sandwiches. Some of the best honey mustard and house sauce we've had. We will be back!

5 stars
Hot Chicken is a new trend and this is definitely a place to try! Sal's Nashville Hot Chicken is located in Plano, TX, corner location and plenty of parking space. The service was quick and our food came out hot and fresh! Very crispy and full of flavor. I had the medium tenders and the heat level was just perfect.  I love spicy food. We also tried the loaded fries and mild tenders. The mild is definitely mild. So if you can't take the heat but want a bit of a spicy kick to the food, mild is your heat level! Overall, very delicious and will be coming back to try the sandwiches! 

Side note: we accidentally messed up and ordered the wrong item. The manager/owner was very kind and gracious and happily corrected it. Wonderful service and staff were super kind!

5 stars
I have been coming here at least once a week since I learned of it about 2 months ago. It's so consistently good every single time. Super spicy and flavorful in the best ways. Highly recommend!!! 

The one thing that will drive me away from places I frequent is inconsistency. THANK YOU for being consistent! Your food is delicious!

3 stars
We came here on a weeknight and tried the waffwich and loaded fries. The waffwich was definitely better and more flavorful. They make the waffles fresh, and I recommend eating that there or the waffles get soggy. We had the medium spice chicken on the waffwich and mild chicken on the loaded fries. The medium was pretty spicy...I'm scared to try the fiery hot. The loaded fries were lackluster and needed more tangier coleslaw and more sauce. Small suggestion for management: I recommend that the lady in the front put her hair in a net while handling other people's food.

5 stars
Ok, Sal's - nicely done. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars - the food is very good, I got the #1 chicken sandwich, fries and a drink combo. The sandwich was great - large piece of chicken, medium heat (just enough to taste it, not enough to regret it) - very surprised by the fries - they were excellent - light, fluffy, great balance between crispy and soft - and a large portion of them!

The kicker for me was the price - just a few dollars too high, but then again, isn't everything right now?! I thought about the chicken and waffles - I'll definitely try those next time. Couple next to me were back for the tenders - they love them! The loaded fries sounded great, but I was by myself and I think those would be best to split with others. 

Ok, so I changed it to 5 stars - I'm not going to let a couple dollars dictate the overall impression of this place - it's really, really good and you have to try it! Be careful of the heat - guy told me he got the hot last time and almost didn't live to regret it - so it's hot! 

Pretty decent lunch crowd for the location - there are so many other options on this Coit/Spring Creek corner - I hope Sal's makes it and keeps on offering a great Nashville Hot Chicken option - it's good.

5 stars
Amazing food - great service - ambiance very welcoming. The two arcade machines gave me nostalgic memories and the whole family enjoyed them. 

Food is always amazing.  We ordered fried chicken medium spice. It was amazing and flavorful reminds me of desi fried chicken back home.

 The kids loved the chicken tenders. Medium and mild spice. Adding the the bread underneath is genius!!! It absorbed the oil and No complaints from kids about oily fingers. 

The wild wild wings is the show stopper. I have never had these flavors before.  It's a nice balance of spice. They were gone so fast. 

The chicken smashburger!!! wow just wow never thought a cheese burger in chicken patty can be soo good!!!! So unique!!! It's definitely a hidden gem ... 

Overalll 10 out of 10!!!! With such good food I'm Surprised Sal's isn't a more known place. Definitely better than other overhyped Nashville places!! 

Sorry no pictures. The food is devoured so quick.

5 stars
great place & one of my favorite chicken sandwich in Dallas

Sal's is located in a complex with other restaurants, so they have a lot of parking. The ambiance is casual, and can have a couple of medium-sized groups with one or two large groups. The staff are helpful, and the menu is the fried chicken, chicken sandwich, loaded fries, etc. We got the zinger sandwich (medium level), the loaded fries with the comeback sauce, 2 piece fried chicken, and the chicken cheese skewer platter. 

First off, I absolutely loved the zinger sandwich! I've had it twice now, and I loved it both times. It has the delicious comeback sauce, juicy chicken, some crunch from the cabbage, but not too much - it's awesome! 

The loaded fries are also super yummy! The fries aren't soggy with oil, it's super saucy, and the fried chicken pieces are juicy! I also like that they give pickles on the side. If I'm feeling for some loaded fried chicken fries, I'd come here. 

The 2 piece fried chicken was also good, the chicken was moist inside and went well with the garlic sauce they gave with it. The breading did need a little more seasoning I felt, and the breading did separate from the chicken on some places.

The platter's rice was flavorful and fluffy - two things I always look for in the rice! They also have a delicious cilantro and what taste like yogurt sauce on the side, which was good, too. The chicken kebab was moist and flavorful, too. When it first came to the table, it was cheesy, which went well with the kebab, but when I'd started cooking down, it got kinda tough (the cheese). I've heard people say when you reheat it at home it gets soft again, but didn't try that. 

Also, I love that they have a great selection of sauces; my favorite is their comeback sauce. 

Overall, I'll be back to have their food again!

4 stars
Sal's is a decent hot chicken spot in Plano. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was solid, but nothing overly special. There are better options in the Dallas area. The chicken was flavorful and crispy and the medium spice level had a nice kick to it. The bun, however got a bit too soggy because the sauce was too thin. The Mac and cheese was not bad and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. Sal's is a good option for hot chicken and will satisfy the craving, but does not rank in the elite tier of hot chicken restaurants in Dallas.

4 stars
Very hot and fresh and delicious. Every bite was crispy and mouthwatering . Would definitely go again

5 stars
Hot chicken spots are found all over the place in the Dallas area.  This is my son and daughter in law's favorite.  We all tried something different and it was delicious.  I tried the medium spice that was almost too hot for me they all did the spicy  and my wife could have had the super spicy she said.  The fries were seasoned and cooked nicely. We have waffle and chicken, I had the waffle sandwich, and sin and wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  It was all terrific my waffle, chicken and slaw combined perfectly and add wing a little syrup to cut the heat is genius.   This family ran business was impeccably clean and service was great.
4.5 for the food, 5 service, and will definitely come back next time we are visiting.  This is the kids "Friday chicken" spot and I can see why.

1 stars
PLS DONT GO HERE the loaded fries are WAYYYY TOO good I am genuinely addicted, idk what they mix in their sauce how they make their chicken so tasty or how their fries are so flavor full but yet soo CRUNCHY and don't even get me started on the coleslaw, I used to hate coleslaw but they some how make it sooo good, i Repeat do not get the loaded fries you will be addicted.

4 stars
I stopped by Sal's this past Friday and ordered the chicken salad (medium heat) and maaaaan! I'm hooked, so hooked I had to try again to see if it was just my imagination, so I ordered the salad and the 4 piece chicken, both medium heat and yeah, it's confirmed.  It's damn good.   Good Job to the peeps at Sal's.

4 stars
Posting again cause we went here again and we just love the sandwiches here! This time, however, we tried the loaded fries which were BOMB!! 
Service was quick and food was amazing just like before!

I love it so much, I drive 27 miles at lunch time to pick it up. Amazing service, delicious food, and the inside of the establishment is cozy.

The chicken tenders were large, but they had more of a panko breading.  I ordered the medium heat level, but I could not decern any spiciness at all.
The french fries were plentiful but flavorless.

4 stars
Came here recently with family visiting us from out of town. It's been a while since we last came here since it's not exactly close.  The food was good so it was nice to see that they've maintained that level of quality. Since we had a big group we got to try a bunch of different things. Fried chicken is really good. Club sandwich is nice but not the Karachi style that I was hoping for. Loaded fries were loaded and Hot chicken sandwich is good as well.

So combine this with keds ice cream adjacent and you have a killer one-two meal combo.

1 stars
They put bread under my three jumbo chicken tenders and i hate bread! Service is slow and takes a long time.

5 stars
Amazing food! The waffles and tender sliders had jalapeño mixed in to make for an amazing sweet and savory bite. The staff is awesome, letting us sample the newer skewers and giving us complementary chai!

4 stars
Service was good and the food was amazing. I had a mild chicken sandwich with fries. It was fresh and tasty. 

Felt a bit grimy as most fried food places do.

5 stars
Omg I went to this spot a third time. That sweet and hot spice mix is sooo addictive. Super clean establishment. Food was so fresh, fully Halal. Cant beat chicken quality and flavor. Will be back again and again

5 stars
Wow what a hidden gem! My friends and I came here after realising pho texas is closed. I love myself a good chicken and waffle and this is definitely one of the better ones I've had!!

Service was fast even though we had about 12 of us walk in at the same time. All of their menu items were great. I would definitely come here again.

5 stars
Ordered through DoorDash and was very pleasantly surprised. Large portion size and so good. We will definitely recommend to others and be back.

3 stars
The service was good here. The hot chicken sandwich was the hot level, but to me it was not terribly hot imo.  The fries were good.  

For a combo at $13.99 I just didn't like the soda cup being small.  The meal price seemed a little high.

4 stars
We were not to be denied. A few days ago went to another hot chicken place but that one is permanently closed now. So rescheduled to come here to try it out. One of three hot chicken places nearby the rest in Dallas/Richardson. Check out photos of interior and food. We got serviced promptly and lots of it. We brought some home as leftovers. Just a few things keep it from 5 stars; no sweetner for ice tea, skimpy napkins (takes too many to clean up), not much for interior decoration. If not ready for hot chicken start with no spice or mild. It takes some getting used to impact on taste buds.

5 stars
Best chicken I've ever eaten, Halal too.Very crispy and moist, delicious sides, comes with a variety of sauces.Choose you spice level upon ordering. Great variety on the menu chicken, sandwiches, chicken & waffles. The staff are very attentive and courteous. I've ordered a 4 piece on several visits, and they often bonus me with 5 pieces

5 stars
Flavorful fried chicken and great ambiance inside with kids play zone . Loved the food and service . For food reviews follow @as.clicks on instagram

Been coming here for over a year now and have never been disappointed. The chicken is great, the slaw is great, and the fries are great. One thing to note is that their medium spicy level is more than adequate if you're not experienced in spice.

3 stars
Sorry had to leave because it smells like Sal's hot *ss  in there. The ambience is poor, nothing even close to Hot Chicks Nashville Hot Chicken. And don't make your customers wait while you talk on the phone, that's just being unappreciative.

5 stars
I ordered the 3 tender with fries - hot. Wow. It was very very good. The spice level was great and there was a great sweetness flavor. The fries were hot and crispy, the sauce was delicious as well! The service was great, friendly, and it took a bit to get the food, but it was very fresh so I don't care. It was clearly made when I ordered it and not just sitting under a lamp. 

I will be back, best Nashville Hot Chicken I have had in a long time!

5 stars
Not sure what "authentic" chicken tenders are supposed to taste like, but if these aren't authentic, I like my chicken tenders inauthentic. 

I got the mild ones and they're exactly as described; not very spicy but definitely full of flavor. The chicken was falling apart without me even having to use my knife, and it was very very juicy (see picture for proof). The sauce is very similar to canes sauce but seems to have more of a ketchup/mayonnaise base; it paired very well with the chicken.

Mac and cheese seems to maybe be made using Velveeta cheese (might be wrong). Not the best I've had but still very good. If I could have changed one thing I would have rather had melted cheese on top rather than the bread crumbs.   

The fries were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall this is probably one of the best halal chicken tenders places I've been to. I even tried it on a full stomach and was still very impressed. I look forward to going back and trying the spicy flavors.

5 stars
Came back to see if the place was still great.  Sandwich and fries still made to order.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had it spiced hot.  Fries were perfect too. Try this place!!

Came for a weekday lunch. I got the standard Nashville Hot Sandwich (#1). It was delcious. I got Medium Spicy - level 3 of 5 - and it was indeed very spicy. I'm happy to know a place that actually makes them spicy, DFW tends to be very tame on these.

I subtracted one star because the staff lacked any enthusiasm and was very silent. The cash register girl barely spoke and seemed to hide out of sight when no one was waiting to pay. The man who brought me my food set it down without a word, not checking if I needed anything. 

I'm pleased enough by the food I'll come back, but it's disappointing they don't bring a fun attitude too. The original Hattie B's in Nashville is really fun.

3 stars
Sal's hot chicken is located practically next door to Popeye's and across the street from Raising Cane's so I'm very curious how well they do.

I had the chicken n waffles medium heat. Surprisingly the medium heat chicken had a dry powder coat and didn't look at wet and sticky as seen in the photos. That said, it was moist inside so I found it acceptable and medium seemed like an accurate description of the spice level.

It comes with one of the house comeback sauce which is a mayo and Worstershire blend similar to Cane's sauce or whatever other tangy pink blend that most restaurants tend to name after themselves. The sauce was fine but they only give you one for two big chicken strips and a second one is really needed. They charge 50 cents each which is always so offputting to me. I opted to try the honey mustard which is also mayo based as it often unfortunately is--honey mustard dressing is the most misleading named product since Grape Nuts, often containing neither mustard nor honey. Anyway both sauces were typical and adequate but average.

Ketchup bottles are on all the tables and they let you use as much ketchup as you want despite it not being any cheaper than the other condiments we've decided as a society to regress and allow to be treated as a premium. What wasn't on the table was salt and pepper so if you want your fries salty, you're out of luck here. That said, the fries weren't bad anyway but I strain to believe there's no salt in the building.

The waffles are cheddar jalapeño and frankly I wish they weren't. I haven't had hot chicken n waffles in Nashville, Tennessee so I can't speak to the authenticity of these decisions, but subjectively speaking, the cheddar was undetectable and the jalapeño flavor clashed with the chicken's spicy coating. I prefer my waffles to contrast with the chicken and normal or even sourdough would be preferable there. The included maple syrup was fine.

I felt this combo also needed one more thing. I've usually had hot chicken served with dill pickles so I was surprised there weren't any included. I see now on the menu they come with them on the chicken tenders only meals but not with the waffles and that's an odd decision. Also it looks like they don't given you much even then. Again I'm reminded of this awful trend of being selfish what used to be free unlimited condiments everywhere. They're still self serve at Dickey's. It's not like there's a cucumber shortage.

I see Coleslaw on the menu but I can't imagine it's worth the $4 they charge for it. Raising Cane's throw a slaw in their combo boxes. Feels like it should have been included here as well. Then also offer a mac and cheese for $4 and a dessert waffle for $7 and that all just seems overpriced to me when the chicken and waffle combo was already $13 in March 2024 prices and $2 more for a drink. I'm not even a boomer, y'all, but this stuff adds up.

So overall it's average. Popeyes is a better deal. Cane's is still more food for the money. But it's enough different that you might pick it sometimes anyway. If they let you have unlimited sauces and pickles and added slaw to the combos I would promote them. Unfortunately, I imagine that ship has sailed.

5 stars
Boy oh boy, was this delicious! We decided just to split an order of the loaded fries - and they were LOADED!! Crispy, delicious fries covered with their hot chicken, vinegar slaw, comeback sauce, and pickles. Oh my gosh, it was so good!! I'm looking forward to going back sometime for trying other things on the menu......but........I'm going to probably have to order the fries again!!! Service was pretty quick!! This place is worth the stop!!!

4 stars
Honestly this place was absolutely delicious. 
Regarding the food itself- 10/10. One of the best hot chicken places we have eaten at. 

Their sauce is well worth the additional 49 cents each. The pickles are delish, and their chicken is perfect. Not too much, and not too little. 

I ordered 3 tenders + fries. The fries were delicious and the tenders were huge, I only ended up eating 2. Thankfully the meal came with a sauce but I would have bought an additional sauce had I known.  
The reason I give this spot a 4 instead of 5 was service. We said for drink we'd like water and didn't receive cups... also when you're exiting and it's a small place it's nice when you hear a "thank you" from the staff.

4 stars
Tried their chicken sandwhich and I have time say the flavor is there and the sandwhich is pretty big and filling. Only complaint is that I felt the chicken was dry. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for more of a Juicy and soft chicken instead of a dry one. I think if they can find a good way to brine the chicken then it could be really good. The location is okay but kind of hard to see at first if you don't know. The outside doesn't look too special at first but once you go in, it's different then what the outside looks. Located in a grocery store complex at the end of the corner. The Google maps may direct you to the opposite side so make sure you drive to the end and you will see it.

The wild wild wings is the show stopper. I have never had these flavors before.  It's a nice balance of spice. They were gone so fast. 

The chicken smashburger!!! wow just wow never thought a cheese burger in chicken patty can be soo good!!!! So unique!!! It's definitely a hidden gem ... 

Overalll 10 out of 10!!!! With such good food I'm Surprised Sal's isn't a more known place. Definitely better than other overhyped Nashville places!! 

Sorry no pictures. The food is devoured so quick.

5 stars
great place & one of my favorite chicken sandwich in Dallas

Sal's is located in a complex with other restaurants, so they have a lot of parking. The ambiance is casual, and can have a couple of medium-sized groups with one or two large groups. The staff are helpful, and the menu is the fried chicken, chicken sandwich, loaded fries, etc. We got the zinger sandwich (medium level), the loaded fries with the comeback sauce, 2 piece fried chicken, and the chicken cheese skewer platter. 

First off, I absolutely loved the zinger sandwich! I've had it twice now, and I loved it both times. It has the delicious comeback sauce, juicy chicken, some crunch from the cabbage, but not too much - it's awesome! 

The loaded fries are also super yummy! The fries aren't soggy with oil, it's super saucy, and the fried chicken pieces are juicy! I also like that they give pickles on the side. If I'm feeling for some loaded fried chicken fries, I'd come here. 

The 2 piece fried chicken was also good, the chicken was moist inside and went well with the garlic sauce they gave with it. The breading did need a little more seasoning I felt, and the breading did separate from the chicken on some places.

The platter's rice was flavorful and fluffy - two things I always look for in the rice! They also have a delicious cilantro and what taste like yogurt sauce on the side, which was good, too. The chicken kebab was moist and flavorful, too. When it first came to the table, it was cheesy, which went well with the kebab, but when I'd started cooking down, it got kinda tough (the cheese). I've heard people say when you reheat it at home it gets soft again, but didn't try that. 

Also, I love that they have a great selection of sauces; my favorite is their comeback sauce. 

Overall, I'll be back to have their food again!

Sal's is a decent hot chicken spot in Plano. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was solid, but nothing overly special. There are better options in the Dallas area. The chicken was flavorful and crispy and the medium spice level had a nice kick to it. The bun, however got a bit too soggy because the sauce was too thin. The Mac and cheese was not bad and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. Sal's is a good option for hot chicken and will satisfy the craving, but does not rank in the elite tier of hot chicken restaurants in Dallas.

4 stars
Very hot and fresh and delicious. Every bite was crispy and mouthwatering . Would definitely go again

5 stars
Hot chicken spots are found all over the place in the Dallas area.  This is my son and daughter in law's favorite.  We all tried something different and it was delicious.  I tried the medium spice that was almost too hot for me they all did the spicy  and my wife could have had the super spicy she said.  The fries were seasoned and cooked nicely. We have waffle and chicken, I had the waffle sandwich, and sin and wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  It was all terrific my waffle, chicken and slaw combined perfectly and add wing a little syrup to cut the heat is genius.   This family ran business was impeccably clean and service was great.
4.5 for the food, 5 service, and will definitely come back next time we are visiting.  This is the kids "Friday chicken" spot and I can see why.

1 stars
PLS DONT GO HERE the loaded fries are WAYYYY TOO good I am genuinely addicted, idk what they mix in their sauce how they make their chicken so tasty or how their fries are so flavor full but yet soo CRUNCHY and don't even get me started on the coleslaw, I used to hate coleslaw but they some how make it sooo good, i Repeat do not get the loaded fries you will be addicted.

4 stars
I stopped by Sal's this past Friday and ordered the chicken salad (medium heat) and maaaaan! I'm hooked, so hooked I had to try again to see if it was just my imagination, so I ordered the salad and the 4 piece chicken, both medium heat and yeah, it's confirmed.  It's damn good.   Good Job to the peeps at Sal's.

Service was quick and food was amazing just like before!

I love it so much, I drive 27 miles at lunch time to pick it up. Amazing service, delicious food, and the inside of the establishment is cozy.

The chicken tenders were large, but they had more of a panko breading.  I ordered the medium heat level, but I could not decern any spiciness at all.
The french fries were plentiful but flavorless.

Came here recently with family visiting us from out of town. It's been a while since we last came here since it's not exactly close.  The food was good so it was nice to see that they've maintained that level of quality. Since we had a big group we got to try a bunch of different things. Fried chicken is really good. Club sandwich is nice but not the Karachi style that I was hoping for. Loaded fries were loaded and Hot chicken sandwich is good as well.

So combine this with keds ice cream adjacent and you have a killer one-two meal combo.

They put bread under my three jumbo chicken tenders and i hate bread! Service is slow and takes a long time.

5 stars
Amazing food! The waffles and tender sliders had jalapeño mixed in to make for an amazing sweet and savory bite. The staff is awesome, letting us sample the newer skewers and giving us complementary chai!

Service was good and the food was amazing. I had a mild chicken sandwich with fries. It was fresh and tasty. 

Felt a bit grimy as most fried food places do.

5 stars
Omg I went to this spot a third time. That sweet and hot spice mix is sooo addictive. Super clean establishment. Food was so fresh, fully Halal. Cant beat chicken quality and flavor. Will be back again and again

5 stars
Wow what a hidden gem! My friends and I came here after realising pho texas is closed. I love myself a good chicken and waffle and this is definitely one of the better ones I've had!!

Service was fast even though we had about 12 of us walk in at the same time. All of their menu items were great. I would definitely come here again.

5 stars
Ordered through DoorDash and was very pleasantly surprised. Large portion size and so good. We will definitely recommend to others and be back.

3 stars
The service was good here. The hot chicken sandwich was the hot level, but to me it was not terribly hot imo.  The fries were good.  

For a combo at $13.99 I just didn't like the soda cup being small.  The meal price seemed a little high.

4 stars
We were not to be denied. A few days ago went to another hot chicken place but that one is permanently closed now. So rescheduled to come here to try it out. One of three hot chicken places nearby the rest in Dallas/Richardson. Check out photos of interior and food. We got serviced promptly and lots of it. We brought some home as leftovers. Just a few things keep it from 5 stars; no sweetner for ice tea, skimpy napkins (takes too many to clean up), not much for interior decoration. If not ready for hot chicken start with no spice or mild. It takes some getting used to impact on taste buds.

5 stars
Best chicken I've ever eaten, Halal too.Very crispy and moist, delicious sides, comes with a variety of sauces.Choose you spice level upon ordering. Great variety on the menu chicken, sandwiches, chicken & waffles. The staff are very attentive and courteous. I've ordered a 4 piece on several visits, and they often bonus me with 5 pieces

Been coming here for over a year now and have never been disappointed. The chicken is great, the slaw is great, and the fries are great. One thing to note is that their medium spicy level is more than adequate if you're not experienced in spice.

3 stars
Sorry had to leave because it smells like Sal's hot *ss  in there. The ambience is poor, nothing even close to Hot Chicks Nashville Hot Chicken. And don't make your customers wait while you talk on the phone, that's just being unappreciative.

5 stars
I ordered the 3 tender with fries - hot. Wow. It was very very good. The spice level was great and there was a great sweetness flavor. The fries were hot and crispy, the sauce was delicious as well! The service was great, friendly, and it took a bit to get the food, but it was very fresh so I don't care. It was clearly made when I ordered it and not just sitting under a lamp. 

I will be back, best Nashville Hot Chicken I have had in a long time!

5 stars
Not sure what "authentic" chicken tenders are supposed to taste like, but if these aren't authentic, I like my chicken tenders inauthentic. 

I got the mild ones and they're exactly as described; not very spicy but definitely full of flavor. The chicken was falling apart without me even having to use my knife, and it was very very juicy (see picture for proof). The sauce is very similar to canes sauce but seems to have more of a ketchup/mayonnaise base; it paired very well with the chicken.

Mac and cheese seems to maybe be made using Velveeta cheese (might be wrong). Not the best I've had but still very good. If I could have changed one thing I would have rather had melted cheese on top rather than the bread crumbs.   

The fries were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall this is probably one of the best halal chicken tenders places I've been to. I even tried it on a full stomach and was still very impressed. I look forward to going back and trying the spicy flavors.

5 stars
Came back to see if the place was still great.  Sandwich and fries still made to order.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had it spiced hot.  Fries were perfect too. Try this place!!

4 stars
Came for a weekday lunch. I got the standard Nashville Hot Sandwich (#1). It was delcious. I got Medium Spicy - level 3 of 5 - and it was indeed very spicy. I'm happy to know a place that actually makes them spicy, DFW tends to be very tame on these.

I subtracted one star because the staff lacked any enthusiasm and was very silent. The cash register girl barely spoke and seemed to hide out of sight when no one was waiting to pay. The man who brought me my food set it down without a word, not checking if I needed anything. 

I'm pleased enough by the food I'll come back, but it's disappointing they don't bring a fun attitude too. The original Hattie B's in Nashville is really fun.

3 stars
Sal's hot chicken is located practically next door to Popeye's and across the street from Raising Cane's so I'm very curious how well they do.

I had the chicken n waffles medium heat. Surprisingly the medium heat chicken had a dry powder coat and didn't look at wet and sticky as seen in the photos. That said, it was moist inside so I found it acceptable and medium seemed like an accurate description of the spice level.

It comes with one of the house comeback sauce which is a mayo and Worstershire blend similar to Cane's sauce or whatever other tangy pink blend that most restaurants tend to name after themselves. The sauce was fine but they only give you one for two big chicken strips and a second one is really needed. They charge 50 cents each which is always so offputting to me. I opted to try the honey mustard which is also mayo based as it often unfortunately is--honey mustard dressing is the most misleading named product since Grape Nuts, often containing neither mustard nor honey. Anyway both sauces were typical and adequate but average.

Ketchup bottles are on all the tables and they let you use as much ketchup as you want despite it not being any cheaper than the other condiments we've decided as a society to regress and allow to be treated as a premium. What wasn't on the table was salt and pepper so if you want your fries salty, you're out of luck here. That said, the fries weren't bad anyway but I strain to believe there's no salt in the building.

The waffles are cheddar jalapeño and frankly I wish they weren't. I haven't had hot chicken n waffles in Nashville, Tennessee so I can't speak to the authenticity of these decisions, but subjectively speaking, the cheddar was undetectable and the jalapeño flavor clashed with the chicken's spicy coating. I prefer my waffles to contrast with the chicken and normal or even sourdough would be preferable there. The included maple syrup was fine.

I felt this combo also needed one more thing. I've usually had hot chicken served with dill pickles so I was surprised there weren't any included. I see now on the menu they come with them on the chicken tenders only meals but not with the waffles and that's an odd decision. Also it looks like they don't given you much even then. Again I'm reminded of this awful trend of being selfish what used to be free unlimited condiments everywhere. They're still self serve at Dickey's. It's not like there's a cucumber shortage.

I see Coleslaw on the menu but I can't imagine it's worth the $4 they charge for it. Raising Cane's throw a slaw in their combo boxes. Feels like it should have been included here as well. Then also offer a mac and cheese for $4 and a dessert waffle for $7 and that all just seems overpriced to me when the chicken and waffle combo was already $13 in March 2024 prices and $2 more for a drink. I'm not even a boomer, y'all, but this stuff adds up.

So overall it's average. Popeyes is a better deal. Cane's is still more food for the money. But it's enough different that you might pick it sometimes anyway. If they let you have unlimited sauces and pickles and added slaw to the combos I would promote them. Unfortunately, I imagine that ship has sailed.

5 stars
Boy oh boy, was this delicious! We decided just to split an order of the loaded fries - and they were LOADED!! Crispy, delicious fries covered with their hot chicken, vinegar slaw, comeback sauce, and pickles. Oh my gosh, it was so good!! I'm looking forward to going back sometime for trying other things on the menu......but........I'm going to probably have to order the fries again!!! Service was pretty quick!! This place is worth the stop!!!

4 stars
Honestly this place was absolutely delicious. 
Regarding the food itself- 10/10. One of the best hot chicken places we have eaten at. 

Their sauce is well worth the additional 49 cents each. The pickles are delish, and their chicken is perfect. Not too much, and not too little. 

I ordered 3 tenders + fries. The fries were delicious and the tenders were huge, I only ended up eating 2. Thankfully the meal came with a sauce but I would have bought an additional sauce had I known.  
The reason I give this spot a 4 instead of 5 was service. We said for drink we'd like water and didn't receive cups... also when you're exiting and it's a small place it's nice when you hear a "thank you" from the staff.

4 stars
Tried their chicken sandwhich and I have time say the flavor is there and the sandwhich is pretty big and filling. Only complaint is that I felt the chicken was dry. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for more of a Juicy and soft chicken instead of a dry one. I think if they can find a good way to brine the chicken then it could be really good. The location is okay but kind of hard to see at first if you don't know. The outside doesn't look too special at first but once you go in, it's different then what the outside looks. Located in a grocery store complex at the end of the corner. The Google maps may direct you to the opposite side so make sure you drive to the end and you will see it.

5 stars
Really impressed by their vast menu, tried a lot of items. Really loved the sandwich, fried chicken, BBQ wings, and loaded fries. Delicious food and amazing service!!!

5 stars
Have eaten here before and loved it so decided to return. Purchased the loaded fries and chicken and waffles. Great combination of flavors and textures. Food tasted fresh. Staff was polite and professional. The location has been remodeled since my last visit. Bathrooms were clean. Would return.

Amazing Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Was hot and crispy, slaw, sauce and pickles were amazing. Hot fries were very good also. Our favorite Nashville Hot Chicken is Howdys in Sugar Land Texas but this was just as good.

5 stars
Stunning presentation, perfectly crispy, taste on point, and great price! Definitely a place I'd come back to try the other sandwhiches. We got our 8 piece chicken to go, broiled them a couple hours later..... still PERFECT! See y'all soon!

5 stars
Delicious food and excellent service! I will definitely be coming back soon! I love the zinger sandwich!

5 stars
Sal's is a cozy spot with loads of flavor. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the Zinger was delightful as well. We were so satisfied that we couldn't even manage to try the Hot Chicken & Waffles!

5 stars
Delicious!!! I had the Waff-wich.. hands down it was amazing! 

It's huge, I could barely finish half of it. And I'm a big girl that hadn't eaten all day.. so yeah there's more than enough to share. 

Waffle was cooked perfectly, soft and not too crunchy. The chicken was crispy, tender, juicy and flavorful. You can't go wrong. 

The prices are definitely worth it considering all the food you're getting and how delicious everything was.

Please give this place a shot!!

Ordered club sandwich.
This was the worst sandwich
It looked like a tuna sandwich
..Terrible taste...It made my stomach sick...Unfortunately we did take out and was extremely hungry...This should be taken seriously...Never again will we eat there...30$ for us to get sick

4 stars
I would post a photo of the sandwich but I ate it to fast it was delish! Better than anticipated... I Just happen to be in the area place looks relatively new and the sign is NOT impressive but the food was (that's what counts.. Got their signature Nashville Hot Chicken (medium heat) 
Bun was buttery brioche perfectly done, chicken was juicy and cooked just right, batter good crisp not burnt or over greased , the slaw and the sauce was very very good. Overall ingredients tasted fresh and very delicious. I don't really give 5 stars to any fast food place but I would give 4.5 to this place !!! I definitely will be back.

4 stars
This is a solid success story that demonstrates what focusing on what you're good at AND taking customer feedback can do for your restaurant. They're serving up clearly fresh food, with portions that are consistently worth it, and the only concern is when it's not hot enough.

Service here is solid, they cover their bases of knowing the menu, having recommendations and keeping the dining area clean. There has been reports in lapses by the management, but the regular employees keep this place running well. They'll even happily accommodate *reasonable* requests and alterations for you. 

I've tried their menu a few times now, so I certainly can I say I have the full breadth of it, and the chicken remains consistent across items and visits. My only concern is quite literally the spice level, not because of it's inadequacy, but because you literally don't get the same flavor if you order below a Hot. Even the fried chicken becomes a new experience just by asking for the Hot Rub applied on top. If they figured out a way to bring that flavor from their spicier offerings down to the less able of consumers, they'd have their 5 star in the bag.

Fresh out the fryer, this revamp of an admittedly weak Peri-Peri spot found it's groove by switching over to what was really selling, the fried chicken sandwiches. With some more time and heeded advice, I'm sure they'll climb to the top of the DFW Halal scene. If you're spice inclined, definitely check this one out!

2 stars
It smells like old grease , the fries taste like old grease . I ordered the loaded fries . The loaded fries was cold , the sauce was ok and chicken was crispy and warm . The bag which I received my food was greasy . The gloves she used to prepare my food she also used to bag my food. The container was greasy , the fries paper was greasy and the actual bag was greasy . The people were nice .

5 stars
Everything came out so fresh and crispy. You should definitely try the wings! Super juicy and flavorful.

4 stars
Good food, good service, and good clean restaurant. The choices are limited as in fried chicken either in a bun or without with different toppings and sauces.

Having said that the food is cooked fresh and served hot. We got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Loaded Fries. The Loaded Fries are fries on fresh coleslaw topped with chopped fried chicken topped with your choice of sauce. I opted for medium spicy and it still had some heat. The sauce had a good spicy-sweet flavor with a slight tangy flavor. 

Overall a good experience.

5 stars
Great flavor. Great spice. Fresh, juicy chicken tenders. Well crafted chicken sandwiches. Some of the best honey mustard and house sauce we've had. We will be back!

5 stars
Hot Chicken is a new trend and this is definitely a place to try! Sal's Nashville Hot Chicken is located in Plano, TX, corner location and plenty of parking space. The service was quick and our food came out hot and fresh! Very crispy and full of flavor. I had the medium tenders and the heat level was just perfect.  I love spicy food. We also tried the loaded fries and mild tenders. The mild is definitely mild. So if you can't take the heat but want a bit of a spicy kick to the food, mild is your heat level! Overall, very delicious and will be coming back to try the sandwiches! 

Side note: we accidentally messed up and ordered the wrong item. The manager/owner was very kind and gracious and happily corrected it. Wonderful service and staff were super kind!

5 stars
I have been coming here at least once a week since I learned of it about 2 months ago. It's so consistently good every single time. Super spicy and flavorful in the best ways. Highly recommend!!! 

The one thing that will drive me away from places I frequent is inconsistency. THANK YOU for being consistent! Your food is delicious!

3 stars
We came here on a weeknight and tried the waffwich and loaded fries. The waffwich was definitely better and more flavorful. They make the waffles fresh, and I recommend eating that there or the waffles get soggy. We had the medium spice chicken on the waffwich and mild chicken on the loaded fries. The medium was pretty spicy...I'm scared to try the fiery hot. The loaded fries were lackluster and needed more tangier coleslaw and more sauce. Small suggestion for management: I recommend that the lady in the front put her hair in a net while handling other people's food.

5 stars
Ok, Sal's - nicely done. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars - the food is very good, I got the #1 chicken sandwich, fries and a drink combo. The sandwich was great - large piece of chicken, medium heat (just enough to taste it, not enough to regret it) - very surprised by the fries - they were excellent - light, fluffy, great balance between crispy and soft - and a large portion of them!

The kicker for me was the price - just a few dollars too high, but then again, isn't everything right now?! I thought about the chicken and waffles - I'll definitely try those next time. Couple next to me were back for the tenders - they love them! The loaded fries sounded great, but I was by myself and I think those would be best to split with others. 

Ok, so I changed it to 5 stars - I'm not going to let a couple dollars dictate the overall impression of this place - it's really, really good and you have to try it! Be careful of the heat - guy told me he got the hot last time and almost didn't live to regret it - so it's hot! 

Pretty decent lunch crowd for the location - there are so many other options on this Coit/Spring Creek corner - I hope Sal's makes it and keeps on offering a great Nashville Hot Chicken option - it's good.

5 stars

Been coming here for over a year now and have never been disappointed. The chicken is great, the slaw is great, and the fries are great. One thing to note is that their medium spicy level is more than adequate if you're not experienced in spice.

Sorry had to leave because it smells like Sal's hot *ss  in there. The ambience is poor, nothing even close to Hot Chicks Nashville Hot Chicken. And don't make your customers wait while you talk on the phone, that's just being unappreciative.

I ordered the 3 tender with fries - hot. Wow. It was very very good. The spice level was great and there was a great sweetness flavor. The fries were hot and crispy, the sauce was delicious as well! The service was great, friendly, and it took a bit to get the food, but it was very fresh so I don't care. It was clearly made when I ordered it and not just sitting under a lamp. 

I will be back, best Nashville Hot Chicken I have had in a long time!

5 stars
Not sure what "authentic" chicken tenders are supposed to taste like, but if these aren't authentic, I like my chicken tenders inauthentic. 

I got the mild ones and they're exactly as described; not very spicy but definitely full of flavor. The chicken was falling apart without me even having to use my knife, and it was very very juicy (see picture for proof). The sauce is very similar to canes sauce but seems to have more of a ketchup/mayonnaise base; it paired very well with the chicken.

Mac and cheese seems to maybe be made using Velveeta cheese (might be wrong). Not the best I've had but still very good. If I could have changed one thing I would have rather had melted cheese on top rather than the bread crumbs.   

The fries were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall this is probably one of the best halal chicken tenders places I've been to. I even tried it on a full stomach and was still very impressed. I look forward to going back and trying the spicy flavors.

5 stars
Came back to see if the place was still great.  Sandwich and fries still made to order.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had it spiced hot.  Fries were perfect too. Try this place!!

Came for a weekday lunch. I got the standard Nashville Hot Sandwich (#1). It was delcious. I got Medium Spicy - level 3 of 5 - and it was indeed very spicy. I'm happy to know a place that actually makes them spicy, DFW tends to be very tame on these.

I subtracted one star because the staff lacked any enthusiasm and was very silent. The cash register girl barely spoke and seemed to hide out of sight when no one was waiting to pay. The man who brought me my food set it down without a word, not checking if I needed anything. 

I'm pleased enough by the food I'll come back, but it's disappointing they don't bring a fun attitude too. The original Hattie B's in Nashville is really fun.

Sal's hot chicken is located practically next door to Popeye's and across the street from Raising Cane's so I'm very curious how well they do.

I had the chicken n waffles medium heat. Surprisingly the medium heat chicken had a dry powder coat and didn't look at wet and sticky as seen in the photos. That said, it was moist inside so I found it acceptable and medium seemed like an accurate description of the spice level.

It comes with one of the house comeback sauce which is a mayo and Worstershire blend similar to Cane's sauce or whatever other tangy pink blend that most restaurants tend to name after themselves. The sauce was fine but they only give you one for two big chicken strips and a second one is really needed. They charge 50 cents each which is always so offputting to me. I opted to try the honey mustard which is also mayo based as it often unfortunately is--honey mustard dressing is the most misleading named product since Grape Nuts, often containing neither mustard nor honey. Anyway both sauces were typical and adequate but average.

Ketchup bottles are on all the tables and they let you use as much ketchup as you want despite it not being any cheaper than the other condiments we've decided as a society to regress and allow to be treated as a premium. What wasn't on the table was salt and pepper so if you want your fries salty, you're out of luck here. That said, the fries weren't bad anyway but I strain to believe there's no salt in the building.

The waffles are cheddar jalapeño and frankly I wish they weren't. I haven't had hot chicken n waffles in Nashville, Tennessee so I can't speak to the authenticity of these decisions, but subjectively speaking, the cheddar was undetectable and the jalapeño flavor clashed with the chicken's spicy coating. I prefer my waffles to contrast with the chicken and normal or even sourdough would be preferable there. The included maple syrup was fine.

I felt this combo also needed one more thing. I've usually had hot chicken served with dill pickles so I was surprised there weren't any included. I see now on the menu they come with them on the chicken tenders only meals but not with the waffles and that's an odd decision. Also it looks like they don't given you much even then. Again I'm reminded of this awful trend of being selfish what used to be free unlimited condiments everywhere. They're still self serve at Dickey's. It's not like there's a cucumber shortage.

I see Coleslaw on the menu but I can't imagine it's worth the $4 they charge for it. Raising Cane's throw a slaw in their combo boxes. Feels like it should have been included here as well. Then also offer a mac and cheese for $4 and a dessert waffle for $7 and that all just seems overpriced to me when the chicken and waffle combo was already $13 in March 2024 prices and $2 more for a drink. I'm not even a boomer, y'all, but this stuff adds up.

So overall it's average. Popeyes is a better deal. Cane's is still more food for the money. But it's enough different that you might pick it sometimes anyway. If they let you have unlimited sauces and pickles and added slaw to the combos I would promote them. Unfortunately, I imagine that ship has sailed.

Boy oh boy, was this delicious! We decided just to split an order of the loaded fries - and they were LOADED!! Crispy, delicious fries covered with their hot chicken, vinegar slaw, comeback sauce, and pickles. Oh my gosh, it was so good!! I'm looking forward to going back sometime for trying other things on the menu......but........I'm going to probably have to order the fries again!!! Service was pretty quick!! This place is worth the stop!!!

4 stars
Honestly this place was absolutely delicious. 
Regarding the food itself- 10/10. One of the best hot chicken places we have eaten at. 

Their sauce is well worth the additional 49 cents each. The pickles are delish, and their chicken is perfect. Not too much, and not too little. 

I ordered 3 tenders + fries. The fries were delicious and the tenders were huge, I only ended up eating 2. Thankfully the meal came with a sauce but I would have bought an additional sauce had I known.  
The reason I give this spot a 4 instead of 5 was service. We said for drink we'd like water and didn't receive cups... also when you're exiting and it's a small place it's nice when you hear a "thank you" from the staff.

4 stars
Tried their chicken sandwhich and I have time say the flavor is there and the sandwhich is pretty big and filling. Only complaint is that I felt the chicken was dry. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for more of a Juicy and soft chicken instead of a dry one. I think if they can find a good way to brine the chicken then it could be really good. The location is okay but kind of hard to see at first if you don't know. The outside doesn't look too special at first but once you go in, it's different then what the outside looks. Located in a grocery store complex at the end of the corner. The Google maps may direct you to the opposite side so make sure you drive to the end and you will see it.

Really impressed by their vast menu, tried a lot of items. Really loved the sandwich, fried chicken, BBQ wings, and loaded fries. Delicious food and amazing service!!!

5 stars
Have eaten here before and loved it so decided to return. Purchased the loaded fries and chicken and waffles. Great combination of flavors and textures. Food tasted fresh. Staff was polite and professional. The location has been remodeled since my last visit. Bathrooms were clean. Would return.

Amazing Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Was hot and crispy, slaw, sauce and pickles were amazing. Hot fries were very good also. Our favorite Nashville Hot Chicken is Howdys in Sugar Land Texas but this was just as good.

5 stars
Stunning presentation, perfectly crispy, taste on point, and great price! Definitely a place I'd come back to try the other sandwhiches. We got our 8 piece chicken to go, broiled them a couple hours later..... still PERFECT! See y'all soon!

5 stars
Delicious food and excellent service! I will definitely be coming back soon! I love the zinger sandwich!

5 stars
Sal's is a cozy spot with loads of flavor. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the Zinger was delightful as well. We were so satisfied that we couldn't even manage to try the Hot Chicken & Waffles!

5 stars
Delicious!!! I had the Waff-wich.. hands down it was amazing! 

It's huge, I could barely finish half of it. And I'm a big girl that hadn't eaten all day.. so yeah there's more than enough to share. 

Waffle was cooked perfectly, soft and not too crunchy. The chicken was crispy, tender, juicy and flavorful. You can't go wrong. 

The prices are definitely worth it considering all the food you're getting and how delicious everything was.

Please give this place a shot!!

1 stars
Ordered club sandwich.
This was the worst sandwich
It looked like a tuna sandwich
..Terrible taste...It made my stomach sick...Unfortunately we did take out and was extremely hungry...This should be taken seriously...Never again will we eat there...30$ for us to get sick

4 stars
I would post a photo of the sandwich but I ate it to fast it was delish! Better than anticipated... I Just happen to be in the area place looks relatively new and the sign is NOT impressive but the food was (that's what counts.. Got their signature Nashville Hot Chicken (medium heat) 
Bun was buttery brioche perfectly done, chicken was juicy and cooked just right, batter good crisp not burnt or over greased , the slaw and the sauce was very very good. Overall ingredients tasted fresh and very delicious. I don't really give 5 stars to any fast food place but I would give 4.5 to this place !!! I definitely will be back.

4 stars
This is a solid success story that demonstrates what focusing on what you're good at AND taking customer feedback can do for your restaurant. They're serving up clearly fresh food, with portions that are consistently worth it, and the only concern is when it's not hot enough.

Service here is solid, they cover their bases of knowing the menu, having recommendations and keeping the dining area clean. There has been reports in lapses by the management, but the regular employees keep this place running well. They'll even happily accommodate *reasonable* requests and alterations for you. 

I've tried their menu a few times now, so I certainly can I say I have the full breadth of it, and the chicken remains consistent across items and visits. My only concern is quite literally the spice level, not because of it's inadequacy, but because you literally don't get the same flavor if you order below a Hot. Even the fried chicken becomes a new experience just by asking for the Hot Rub applied on top. If they figured out a way to bring that flavor from their spicier offerings down to the less able of consumers, they'd have their 5 star in the bag.

Fresh out the fryer, this revamp of an admittedly weak Peri-Peri spot found it's groove by switching over to what was really selling, the fried chicken sandwiches. With some more time and heeded advice, I'm sure they'll climb to the top of the DFW Halal scene. If you're spice inclined, definitely check this one out!

2 stars
It smells like old grease , the fries taste like old grease . I ordered the loaded fries . The loaded fries was cold , the sauce was ok and chicken was crispy and warm . The bag which I received my food was greasy . The gloves she used to prepare my food she also used to bag my food. The container was greasy , the fries paper was greasy and the actual bag was greasy . The people were nice .

5 stars
Everything came out so fresh and crispy. You should definitely try the wings! Super juicy and flavorful.

4 stars
Good food, good service, and good clean restaurant. The choices are limited as in fried chicken either in a bun or without with different toppings and sauces.

Having said that the food is cooked fresh and served hot. We got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Loaded Fries. The Loaded Fries are fries on fresh coleslaw topped with chopped fried chicken topped with your choice of sauce. I opted for medium spicy and it still had some heat. The sauce had a good spicy-sweet flavor with a slight tangy flavor. 

Overall a good experience.

5 stars
Great flavor. Great spice. Fresh, juicy chicken tenders. Well crafted chicken sandwiches. Some of the best honey mustard and house sauce we've had. We will be back!

5 stars
Hot Chicken is a new trend and this is definitely a place to try! Sal's Nashville Hot Chicken is located in Plano, TX, corner location and plenty of parking space. The service was quick and our food came out hot and fresh! Very crispy and full of flavor. I had the medium tenders and the heat level was just perfect.  I love spicy food. We also tried the loaded fries and mild tenders. The mild is definitely mild. So if you can't take the heat but want a bit of a spicy kick to the food, mild is your heat level! Overall, very delicious and will be coming back to try the sandwiches! 

Side note: we accidentally messed up and ordered the wrong item. The manager/owner was very kind and gracious and happily corrected it. Wonderful service and staff were super kind!

5 stars
I have been coming here at least once a week since I learned of it about 2 months ago. It's so consistently good every single time. Super spicy and flavorful in the best ways. Highly recommend!!! 

The one thing that will drive me away from places I frequent is inconsistency. THANK YOU for being consistent! Your food is delicious!

3 stars
We came here on a weeknight and tried the waffwich and loaded fries. The waffwich was definitely better and more flavorful. They make the waffles fresh, and I recommend eating that there or the waffles get soggy. We had the medium spice chicken on the waffwich and mild chicken on the loaded fries. The medium was pretty spicy...I'm scared to try the fiery hot. The loaded fries were lackluster and needed more tangier coleslaw and more sauce. Small suggestion for management: I recommend that the lady in the front put her hair in a net while handling other people's food.

5 stars
Ok, Sal's - nicely done. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars - the food is very good, I got the #1 chicken sandwich, fries and a drink combo. The sandwich was great - large piece of chicken, medium heat (just enough to taste it, not enough to regret it) - very surprised by the fries - they were excellent - light, fluffy, great balance between crispy and soft - and a large portion of them!

The kicker for me was the price - just a few dollars too high, but then again, isn't everything right now?! I thought about the chicken and waffles - I'll definitely try those next time. Couple next to me were back for the tenders - they love them! The loaded fries sounded great, but I was by myself and I think those would be best to split with others. 

Ok, so I changed it to 5 stars - I'm not going to let a couple dollars dictate the overall impression of this place - it's really, really good and you have to try it! Be careful of the heat - guy told me he got the hot last time and almost didn't live to regret it - so it's hot! 

Pretty decent lunch crowd for the location - there are so many other options on this Coit/Spring Creek corner - I hope Sal's makes it and keeps on offering a great Nashville Hot Chicken option - it's good.

5 stars
Amazing food - great service - ambiance very welcoming. The two arcade machines gave me nostalgic memories and the whole family enjoyed them. 

Food is always amazing.  We ordered fried chicken medium spice. It was amazing and flavorful reminds me of desi fried chicken back home.

 The kids loved the chicken tenders. Medium and mild spice. Adding the the bread underneath is genius!!! It absorbed the oil and No complaints from kids about oily fingers. 

The wild wild wings is the show stopper. I have never had these flavors before.  It's a nice balance of spice. They were gone so fast. 

The chicken smashburger!!! wow just wow never thought a cheese burger in chicken patty can be soo good!!!! So unique!!! It's definitely a hidden gem ... 

Overalll 10 out of 10!!!! With such good food I'm Surprised Sal's isn't a more known place. Definitely better than other overhyped Nashville places!! 

Sorry no pictures. The food is devoured so quick.

5 stars
great place & one of my favorite chicken sandwich in Dallas

Sal's is located in a complex with other restaurants, so they have a lot of parking. The ambiance is casual, and can have a couple of medium-sized groups with one or two large groups. The staff are helpful, and the menu is the fried chicken, chicken sandwich, loaded fries, etc. We got the zinger sandwich (medium level), the loaded fries with the comeback sauce, 2 piece fried chicken, and the chicken cheese skewer platter. 

First off, I absolutely loved the zinger sandwich! I've had it twice now, and I loved it both times. It has the delicious comeback sauce, juicy chicken, some crunch from the cabbage, but not too much - it's awesome! 

The loaded fries are also super yummy! The fries aren't soggy with oil, it's super saucy, and the fried chicken pieces are juicy! I also like that they give pickles on the side. If I'm feeling for some loaded fried chicken fries, I'd come here. 

The 2 piece fried chicken was also good, the chicken was moist inside and went well with the garlic sauce they gave with it. The breading did need a little more seasoning I felt, and the breading did separate from the chicken on some places.

The platter's rice was flavorful and fluffy - two things I always look for in the rice! They also have a delicious cilantro and what taste like yogurt sauce on the side, which was good, too. The chicken kebab was moist and flavorful, too. When it first came to the table, it was cheesy, which went well with the kebab, but when I'd started cooking down, it got kinda tough (the cheese). I've heard people say when you reheat it at home it gets soft again, but didn't try that. 

Also, I love that they have a great selection of sauces; my favorite is their comeback sauce. 

Overall, I'll be back to have their food again!

4 stars
Sal's is a decent hot chicken spot in Plano. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was solid, but nothing overly special. There are better options in the Dallas area. The chicken was flavorful and crispy and the medium spice level had a nice kick to it. The bun, however got a bit too soggy because the sauce was too thin. The Mac and cheese was not bad and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. Sal's is a good option for hot chicken and will satisfy the craving, but does not rank in the elite tier of hot chicken restaurants in Dallas.

4 stars
Very hot and fresh and delicious. Every bite was crispy and mouthwatering . Would definitely go again

5 stars
Hot chicken spots are found all over the place in the Dallas area.  This is my son and daughter in law's favorite.  We all tried something different and it was delicious.  I tried the medium spice that was almost too hot for me they all did the spicy  and my wife could have had the super spicy she said.  The fries were seasoned and cooked nicely. We have waffle and chicken, I had the waffle sandwich, and sin and wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  It was all terrific my waffle, chicken and slaw combined perfectly and add wing a little syrup to cut the heat is genius.   This family ran business was impeccably clean and service was great.
4.5 for the food, 5 service, and will definitely come back next time we are visiting.  This is the kids "Friday chicken" spot and I can see why.

1 stars
PLS DONT GO HERE the loaded fries are WAYYYY TOO good I am genuinely addicted, idk what they mix in their sauce how they make their chicken so tasty or how their fries are so flavor full but yet soo CRUNCHY and don't even get me started on the coleslaw, I used to hate coleslaw but they some how make it sooo good, i Repeat do not get the loaded fries you will be addicted.

4 stars
I stopped by Sal's this past Friday and ordered the chicken salad (medium heat) and maaaaan! I'm hooked, so hooked I had to try again to see if it was just my imagination, so I ordered the salad and the 4 piece chicken, both medium heat and yeah, it's confirmed.  It's damn good.   Good Job to the peeps at Sal's.

The chicken tenders were large, but they had more of a panko breading.  I ordered the medium heat level, but I could not decern any spiciness at all.
The french fries were plentiful but flavorless.

Came here recently with family visiting us from out of town. It's been a while since we last came here since it's not exactly close.  The food was good so it was nice to see that they've maintained that level of quality. Since we had a big group we got to try a bunch of different things. Fried chicken is really good. Club sandwich is nice but not the Karachi style that I was hoping for. Loaded fries were loaded and Hot chicken sandwich is good as well.

So combine this with keds ice cream adjacent and you have a killer one-two meal combo.

They put bread under my three jumbo chicken tenders and i hate bread! Service is slow and takes a long time.

Amazing food! The waffles and tender sliders had jalapeño mixed in to make for an amazing sweet and savory bite. The staff is awesome, letting us sample the newer skewers and giving us complementary chai!

Service was good and the food was amazing. I had a mild chicken sandwich with fries. It was fresh and tasty. 

Felt a bit grimy as most fried food places do.

Omg I went to this spot a third time. That sweet and hot spice mix is sooo addictive. Super clean establishment. Food was so fresh, fully Halal. Cant beat chicken quality and flavor. Will be back again and again

5 stars
Wow what a hidden gem! My friends and I came here after realising pho texas is closed. I love myself a good chicken and waffle and this is definitely one of the better ones I've had!!

Service was fast even though we had about 12 of us walk in at the same time. All of their menu items were great. I would definitely come here again.

5 stars
Ordered through DoorDash and was very pleasantly surprised. Large portion size and so good. We will definitely recommend to others and be back.

3 stars
The service was good here. The hot chicken sandwich was the hot level, but to me it was not terribly hot imo.  The fries were good.  

For a combo at $13.99 I just didn't like the soda cup being small.  The meal price seemed a little high.

4 stars
We were not to be denied. A few days ago went to another hot chicken place but that one is permanently closed now. So rescheduled to come here to try it out. One of three hot chicken places nearby the rest in Dallas/Richardson. Check out photos of interior and food. We got serviced promptly and lots of it. We brought some home as leftovers. Just a few things keep it from 5 stars; no sweetner for ice tea, skimpy napkins (takes too many to clean up), not much for interior decoration. If not ready for hot chicken start with no spice or mild. It takes some getting used to impact on taste buds.

5 stars
Best chicken I've ever eaten, Halal too.Very crispy and moist, delicious sides, comes with a variety of sauces.Choose you spice level upon ordering. Great variety on the menu chicken, sandwiches, chicken & waffles. The staff are very attentive and courteous. I've ordered a 4 piece on several visits, and they often bonus me with 5 pieces

Amazing Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Was hot and crispy, slaw, sauce and pickles were amazing. Hot fries were very good also. Our favorite Nashville Hot Chicken is Howdys in Sugar Land Texas but this was just as good.

5 stars
Stunning presentation, perfectly crispy, taste on point, and great price! Definitely a place I'd come back to try the other sandwhiches. We got our 8 piece chicken to go, broiled them a couple hours later..... still PERFECT! See y'all soon!

Delicious food and excellent service! I will definitely be coming back soon! I love the zinger sandwich!

Sal's is a cozy spot with loads of flavor. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the Zinger was delightful as well. We were so satisfied that we couldn't even manage to try the Hot Chicken & Waffles!

5 stars
Delicious!!! I had the Waff-wich.. hands down it was amazing! 

It's huge, I could barely finish half of it. And I'm a big girl that hadn't eaten all day.. so yeah there's more than enough to share. 

Waffle was cooked perfectly, soft and not too crunchy. The chicken was crispy, tender, juicy and flavorful. You can't go wrong. 

The prices are definitely worth it considering all the food you're getting and how delicious everything was.

Please give this place a shot!!

Ordered club sandwich.
This was the worst sandwich
It looked like a tuna sandwich
..Terrible taste...It made my stomach sick...Unfortunately we did take out and was extremely hungry...This should be taken seriously...Never again will we eat there...30$ for us to get sick

4 stars
I would post a photo of the sandwich but I ate it to fast it was delish! Better than anticipated... I Just happen to be in the area place looks relatively new and the sign is NOT impressive but the food was (that's what counts.. Got their signature Nashville Hot Chicken (medium heat) 
Bun was buttery brioche perfectly done, chicken was juicy and cooked just right, batter good crisp not burnt or over greased , the slaw and the sauce was very very good. Overall ingredients tasted fresh and very delicious. I don't really give 5 stars to any fast food place but I would give 4.5 to this place !!! I definitely will be back.

This is a solid success story that demonstrates what focusing on what you're good at AND taking customer feedback can do for your restaurant. They're serving up clearly fresh food, with portions that are consistently worth it, and the only concern is when it's not hot enough.

Service here is solid, they cover their bases of knowing the menu, having recommendations and keeping the dining area clean. There has been reports in lapses by the management, but the regular employees keep this place running well. They'll even happily accommodate *reasonable* requests and alterations for you. 

I've tried their menu a few times now, so I certainly can I say I have the full breadth of it, and the chicken remains consistent across items and visits. My only concern is quite literally the spice level, not because of it's inadequacy, but because you literally don't get the same flavor if you order below a Hot. Even the fried chicken becomes a new experience just by asking for the Hot Rub applied on top. If they figured out a way to bring that flavor from their spicier offerings down to the less able of consumers, they'd have their 5 star in the bag.

Fresh out the fryer, this revamp of an admittedly weak Peri-Peri spot found it's groove by switching over to what was really selling, the fried chicken sandwiches. With some more time and heeded advice, I'm sure they'll climb to the top of the DFW Halal scene. If you're spice inclined, definitely check this one out!

It smells like old grease , the fries taste like old grease . I ordered the loaded fries . The loaded fries was cold , the sauce was ok and chicken was crispy and warm . The bag which I received my food was greasy . The gloves she used to prepare my food she also used to bag my food. The container was greasy , the fries paper was greasy and the actual bag was greasy . The people were nice .

Everything came out so fresh and crispy. You should definitely try the wings! Super juicy and flavorful.

4 stars
Good food, good service, and good clean restaurant. The choices are limited as in fried chicken either in a bun or without with different toppings and sauces.

Having said that the food is cooked fresh and served hot. We got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Loaded Fries. The Loaded Fries are fries on fresh coleslaw topped with chopped fried chicken topped with your choice of sauce. I opted for medium spicy and it still had some heat. The sauce had a good spicy-sweet flavor with a slight tangy flavor. 

Overall a good experience.

5 stars
Great flavor. Great spice. Fresh, juicy chicken tenders. Well crafted chicken sandwiches. Some of the best honey mustard and house sauce we've had. We will be back!

5 stars
Hot Chicken is a new trend and this is definitely a place to try! Sal's Nashville Hot Chicken is located in Plano, TX, corner location and plenty of parking space. The service was quick and our food came out hot and fresh! Very crispy and full of flavor. I had the medium tenders and the heat level was just perfect.  I love spicy food. We also tried the loaded fries and mild tenders. The mild is definitely mild. So if you can't take the heat but want a bit of a spicy kick to the food, mild is your heat level! Overall, very delicious and will be coming back to try the sandwiches! 

Side note: we accidentally messed up and ordered the wrong item. The manager/owner was very kind and gracious and happily corrected it. Wonderful service and staff were super kind!

5 stars
I have been coming here at least once a week since I learned of it about 2 months ago. It's so consistently good every single time. Super spicy and flavorful in the best ways. Highly recommend!!! 

The one thing that will drive me away from places I frequent is inconsistency. THANK YOU for being consistent! Your food is delicious!

3 stars
We came here on a weeknight and tried the waffwich and loaded fries. The waffwich was definitely better and more flavorful. They make the waffles fresh, and I recommend eating that there or the waffles get soggy. We had the medium spice chicken on the waffwich and mild chicken on the loaded fries. The medium was pretty spicy...I'm scared to try the fiery hot. The loaded fries were lackluster and needed more tangier coleslaw and more sauce. Small suggestion for management: I recommend that the lady in the front put her hair in a net while handling other people's food.

5 stars
Ok, Sal's - nicely done. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars - the food is very good, I got the #1 chicken sandwich, fries and a drink combo. The sandwich was great - large piece of chicken, medium heat (just enough to taste it, not enough to regret it) - very surprised by the fries - they were excellent - light, fluffy, great balance between crispy and soft - and a large portion of them!

The kicker for me was the price - just a few dollars too high, but then again, isn't everything right now?! I thought about the chicken and waffles - I'll definitely try those next time. Couple next to me were back for the tenders - they love them! The loaded fries sounded great, but I was by myself and I think those would be best to split with others. 

Ok, so I changed it to 5 stars - I'm not going to let a couple dollars dictate the overall impression of this place - it's really, really good and you have to try it! Be careful of the heat - guy told me he got the hot last time and almost didn't live to regret it - so it's hot! 

Pretty decent lunch crowd for the location - there are so many other options on this Coit/Spring Creek corner - I hope Sal's makes it and keeps on offering a great Nashville Hot Chicken option - it's good.

5 stars
Amazing food - great service - ambiance very welcoming. The two arcade machines gave me nostalgic memories and the whole family enjoyed them. 

Food is always amazing.  We ordered fried chicken medium spice. It was amazing and flavorful reminds me of desi fried chicken back home.

 The kids loved the chicken tenders. Medium and mild spice. Adding the the bread underneath is genius!!! It absorbed the oil and No complaints from kids about oily fingers. 

The wild wild wings is the show stopper. I have never had these flavors before.  It's a nice balance of spice. They were gone so fast. 

The chicken smashburger!!! wow just wow never thought a cheese burger in chicken patty can be soo good!!!! So unique!!! It's definitely a hidden gem ... 

Overalll 10 out of 10!!!! With such good food I'm Surprised Sal's isn't a more known place. Definitely better than other overhyped Nashville places!! 

Sorry no pictures. The food is devoured so quick.

5 stars
great place & one of my favorite chicken sandwich in Dallas

Sal's is located in a complex with other restaurants, so they have a lot of parking. The ambiance is casual, and can have a couple of medium-sized groups with one or two large groups. The staff are helpful, and the menu is the fried chicken, chicken sandwich, loaded fries, etc. We got the zinger sandwich (medium level), the loaded fries with the comeback sauce, 2 piece fried chicken, and the chicken cheese skewer platter. 

First off, I absolutely loved the zinger sandwich! I've had it twice now, and I loved it both times. It has the delicious comeback sauce, juicy chicken, some crunch from the cabbage, but not too much - it's awesome! 

The loaded fries are also super yummy! The fries aren't soggy with oil, it's super saucy, and the fried chicken pieces are juicy! I also like that they give pickles on the side. If I'm feeling for some loaded fried chicken fries, I'd come here. 

The 2 piece fried chicken was also good, the chicken was moist inside and went well with the garlic sauce they gave with it. The breading did need a little more seasoning I felt, and the breading did separate from the chicken on some places.

The platter's rice was flavorful and fluffy - two things I always look for in the rice! They also have a delicious cilantro and what taste like yogurt sauce on the side, which was good, too. The chicken kebab was moist and flavorful, too. When it first came to the table, it was cheesy, which went well with the kebab, but when I'd started cooking down, it got kinda tough (the cheese). I've heard people say when you reheat it at home it gets soft again, but didn't try that. 

Also, I love that they have a great selection of sauces; my favorite is their comeback sauce. 

Overall, I'll be back to have their food again!

4 stars
Sal's is a decent hot chicken spot in Plano. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was solid, but nothing overly special. There are better options in the Dallas area. The chicken was flavorful and crispy and the medium spice level had a nice kick to it. The bun, however got a bit too soggy because the sauce was too thin. The Mac and cheese was not bad and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. Sal's is a good option for hot chicken and will satisfy the craving, but does not rank in the elite tier of hot chicken restaurants in Dallas.

4 stars
Very hot and fresh and delicious. Every bite was crispy and mouthwatering . Would definitely go again

5 stars
Hot chicken spots are found all over the place in the Dallas area.  This is my son and daughter in law's favorite.  We all tried something different and it was delicious.  I tried the medium spice that was almost too hot for me they all did the spicy  and my wife could have had the super spicy she said.  The fries were seasoned and cooked nicely. We have waffle and chicken, I had the waffle sandwich, and sin and wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  It was all terrific my waffle, chicken and slaw combined perfectly and add wing a little syrup to cut the heat is genius.   This family ran business was impeccably clean and service was great.
4.5 for the food, 5 service, and will definitely come back next time we are visiting.  This is the kids "Friday chicken" spot and I can see why.

1 stars
PLS DONT GO HERE the loaded fries are WAYYYY TOO good I am genuinely addicted, idk what they mix in their sauce how they make their chicken so tasty or how their fries are so flavor full but yet soo CRUNCHY and don't even get me started on the coleslaw, I used to hate coleslaw but they some how make it sooo good, i Repeat do not get the loaded fries you will be addicted.

4 stars
I stopped by Sal's this past Friday and ordered the chicken salad (medium heat) and maaaaan! I'm hooked, so hooked I had to try again to see if it was just my imagination, so I ordered the salad and the 4 piece chicken, both medium heat and yeah, it's confirmed.  It's damn good.   Good Job to the peeps at Sal's.

4 stars
Posting again cause we went here again and we just love the sandwiches here! This time, however, we tried the loaded fries which were BOMB!! 
Service was quick and food was amazing just like before!

I love it so much, I drive 27 miles at lunch time to pick it up. Amazing service, delicious food, and the inside of the establishment is cozy.

The chicken tenders were large, but they had more of a panko breading.  I ordered the medium heat level, but I could not decern any spiciness at all.
The french fries were plentiful but flavorless.

4 stars
Came here recently with family visiting us from out of town. It's been a while since we last came here since it's not exactly close.  The food was good so it was nice to see that they've maintained that level of quality. Since we had a big group we got to try a bunch of different things. Fried chicken is really good. Club sandwich is nice but not the Karachi style that I was hoping for. Loaded fries were loaded and Hot chicken sandwich is good as well.

So combine this with keds ice cream adjacent and you have a killer one-two meal combo.

1 stars
They put bread under my three jumbo chicken tenders and i hate bread! Service is slow and takes a long time.

5 stars
Amazing food! The waffles and tender sliders had jalapeño mixed in to make for an amazing sweet and savory bite. The staff is awesome, letting us sample the newer skewers and giving us complementary chai!

4 stars
Service was good and the food was amazing. I had a mild chicken sandwich with fries. It was fresh and tasty. 

Felt a bit grimy as most fried food places do.

5 stars
Omg I went to this spot a third time. That sweet and hot spice mix is sooo addictive. Super clean establishment. Food was so fresh, fully Halal. Cant beat chicken quality and flavor. Will be back again and again

5 stars
Wow what a hidden gem! My friends and I came here after realising pho texas is closed. I love myself a good chicken and waffle and this is definitely one of the better ones I've had!!

Service was fast even though we had about 12 of us walk in at the same time. All of their menu items were great. I would definitely come here again.

5 stars
Ordered through DoorDash and was very pleasantly surprised. Large portion size and so good. We will definitely recommend to others and be back.

3 stars
The service was good here. The hot chicken sandwich was the hot level, but to me it was not terribly hot imo.  The fries were good.  

For a combo at $13.99 I just didn't like the soda cup being small.  The meal price seemed a little high.

4 stars
We were not to be denied. A few days ago went to another hot chicken place but that one is permanently closed now. So rescheduled to come here to try it out. One of three hot chicken places nearby the rest in Dallas/Richardson. Check out photos of interior and food. We got serviced promptly and lots of it. We brought some home as leftovers. Just a few things keep it from 5 stars; no sweetner for ice tea, skimpy napkins (takes too many to clean up), not much for interior decoration. If not ready for hot chicken start with no spice or mild. It takes some getting used to impact on taste buds.

5 stars
Best chicken I've ever eaten, Halal too.Very crispy and moist, delicious sides, comes with a variety of sauces.Choose you spice level upon ordering. Great variety on the menu chicken, sandwiches, chicken & waffles. The staff are very attentive and courteous. I've ordered a 4 piece on several visits, and they often bonus me with 5 pieces

5 stars
Flavorful fried chicken and great ambiance inside with kids play zone . Loved the food and service . For food reviews follow @as.clicks on instagram

Been coming here for over a year now and have never been disappointed. The chicken is great, the slaw is great, and the fries are great. One thing to note is that their medium spicy level is more than adequate if you're not experienced in spice.

3 stars
Sorry had to leave because it smells like Sal's hot *ss  in there. The ambience is poor, nothing even close to Hot Chicks Nashville Hot Chicken. And don't make your customers wait while you talk on the phone, that's just being unappreciative.

5 stars
I ordered the 3 tender with fries - hot. Wow. It was very very good. The spice level was great and there was a great sweetness flavor. The fries were hot and crispy, the sauce was delicious as well! The service was great, friendly, and it took a bit to get the food, but it was very fresh so I don't care. It was clearly made when I ordered it and not just sitting under a lamp. 

I will be back, best Nashville Hot Chicken I have had in a long time!

5 stars
Not sure what "authentic" chicken tenders are supposed to taste like, but if these aren't authentic, I like my chicken tenders inauthentic. 

I got the mild ones and they're exactly as described; not very spicy but definitely full of flavor. The chicken was falling apart without me even having to use my knife, and it was very very juicy (see picture for proof). The sauce is very similar to canes sauce but seems to have more of a ketchup/mayonnaise base; it paired very well with the chicken.

Mac and cheese seems to maybe be made using Velveeta cheese (might be wrong). Not the best I've had but still very good. If I could have changed one thing I would have rather had melted cheese on top rather than the bread crumbs.   

The fries were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall this is probably one of the best halal chicken tenders places I've been to. I even tried it on a full stomach and was still very impressed. I look forward to going back and trying the spicy flavors.

5 stars
Came back to see if the place was still great.  Sandwich and fries still made to order.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had it spiced hot.  Fries were perfect too. Try this place!!

Came for a weekday lunch. I got the standard Nashville Hot Sandwich (#1). It was delcious. I got Medium Spicy - level 3 of 5 - and it was indeed very spicy. I'm happy to know a place that actually makes them spicy, DFW tends to be very tame on these.

I subtracted one star because the staff lacked any enthusiasm and was very silent. The cash register girl barely spoke and seemed to hide out of sight when no one was waiting to pay. The man who brought me my food set it down without a word, not checking if I needed anything. 

I'm pleased enough by the food I'll come back, but it's disappointing they don't bring a fun attitude too. The original Hattie B's in Nashville is really fun.

3 stars
Sal's hot chicken is located practically next door to Popeye's and across the street from Raising Cane's so I'm very curious how well they do.

I had the chicken n waffles medium heat. Surprisingly the medium heat chicken had a dry powder coat and didn't look at wet and sticky as seen in the photos. That said, it was moist inside so I found it acceptable and medium seemed like an accurate description of the spice level.

It comes with one of the house comeback sauce which is a mayo and Worstershire blend similar to Cane's sauce or whatever other tangy pink blend that most restaurants tend to name after themselves. The sauce was fine but they only give you one for two big chicken strips and a second one is really needed. They charge 50 cents each which is always so offputting to me. I opted to try the honey mustard which is also mayo based as it often unfortunately is--honey mustard dressing is the most misleading named product since Grape Nuts, often containing neither mustard nor honey. Anyway both sauces were typical and adequate but average.

Ketchup bottles are on all the tables and they let you use as much ketchup as you want despite it not being any cheaper than the other condiments we've decided as a society to regress and allow to be treated as a premium. What wasn't on the table was salt and pepper so if you want your fries salty, you're out of luck here. That said, the fries weren't bad anyway but I strain to believe there's no salt in the building.

The waffles are cheddar jalapeño and frankly I wish they weren't. I haven't had hot chicken n waffles in Nashville, Tennessee so I can't speak to the authenticity of these decisions, but subjectively speaking, the cheddar was undetectable and the jalapeño flavor clashed with the chicken's spicy coating. I prefer my waffles to contrast with the chicken and normal or even sourdough would be preferable there. The included maple syrup was fine.

I felt this combo also needed one more thing. I've usually had hot chicken served with dill pickles so I was surprised there weren't any included. I see now on the menu they come with them on the chicken tenders only meals but not with the waffles and that's an odd decision. Also it looks like they don't given you much even then. Again I'm reminded of this awful trend of being selfish what used to be free unlimited condiments everywhere. They're still self serve at Dickey's. It's not like there's a cucumber shortage.

I see Coleslaw on the menu but I can't imagine it's worth the $4 they charge for it. Raising Cane's throw a slaw in their combo boxes. Feels like it should have been included here as well. Then also offer a mac and cheese for $4 and a dessert waffle for $7 and that all just seems overpriced to me when the chicken and waffle combo was already $13 in March 2024 prices and $2 more for a drink. I'm not even a boomer, y'all, but this stuff adds up.

So overall it's average. Popeyes is a better deal. Cane's is still more food for the money. But it's enough different that you might pick it sometimes anyway. If they let you have unlimited sauces and pickles and added slaw to the combos I would promote them. Unfortunately, I imagine that ship has sailed.

5 stars
Boy oh boy, was this delicious! We decided just to split an order of the loaded fries - and they were LOADED!! Crispy, delicious fries covered with their hot chicken, vinegar slaw, comeback sauce, and pickles. Oh my gosh, it was so good!! I'm looking forward to going back sometime for trying other things on the menu......but........I'm going to probably have to order the fries again!!! Service was pretty quick!! This place is worth the stop!!!

4 stars
Honestly this place was absolutely delicious. 
Regarding the food itself- 10/10. One of the best hot chicken places we have eaten at. 

Their sauce is well worth the additional 49 cents each. The pickles are delish, and their chicken is perfect. Not too much, and not too little. 

I ordered 3 tenders + fries. The fries were delicious and the tenders were huge, I only ended up eating 2. Thankfully the meal came with a sauce but I would have bought an additional sauce had I known.  
The reason I give this spot a 4 instead of 5 was service. We said for drink we'd like water and didn't receive cups... also when you're exiting and it's a small place it's nice when you hear a "thank you" from the staff.

4 stars
Tried their chicken sandwhich and I have time say the flavor is there and the sandwhich is pretty big and filling. Only complaint is that I felt the chicken was dry. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for more of a Juicy and soft chicken instead of a dry one. I think if they can find a good way to brine the chicken then it could be really good. The location is okay but kind of hard to see at first if you don't know. The outside doesn't look too special at first but once you go in, it's different then what the outside looks. Located in a grocery store complex at the end of the corner. The Google maps may direct you to the opposite side so make sure you drive to the end and you will see it.

The chicken smashburger!!! wow just wow never thought a cheese burger in chicken patty can be soo good!!!! So unique!!! It's definitely a hidden gem ... 

Overalll 10 out of 10!!!! With such good food I'm Surprised Sal's isn't a more known place. Definitely better than other overhyped Nashville places!! 

Sorry no pictures. The food is devoured so quick.

5 stars
great place & one of my favorite chicken sandwich in Dallas

Sal's is located in a complex with other restaurants, so they have a lot of parking. The ambiance is casual, and can have a couple of medium-sized groups with one or two large groups. The staff are helpful, and the menu is the fried chicken, chicken sandwich, loaded fries, etc. We got the zinger sandwich (medium level), the loaded fries with the comeback sauce, 2 piece fried chicken, and the chicken cheese skewer platter. 

First off, I absolutely loved the zinger sandwich! I've had it twice now, and I loved it both times. It has the delicious comeback sauce, juicy chicken, some crunch from the cabbage, but not too much - it's awesome! 

The loaded fries are also super yummy! The fries aren't soggy with oil, it's super saucy, and the fried chicken pieces are juicy! I also like that they give pickles on the side. If I'm feeling for some loaded fried chicken fries, I'd come here. 

The 2 piece fried chicken was also good, the chicken was moist inside and went well with the garlic sauce they gave with it. The breading did need a little more seasoning I felt, and the breading did separate from the chicken on some places.

The platter's rice was flavorful and fluffy - two things I always look for in the rice! They also have a delicious cilantro and what taste like yogurt sauce on the side, which was good, too. The chicken kebab was moist and flavorful, too. When it first came to the table, it was cheesy, which went well with the kebab, but when I'd started cooking down, it got kinda tough (the cheese). I've heard people say when you reheat it at home it gets soft again, but didn't try that. 

Also, I love that they have a great selection of sauces; my favorite is their comeback sauce. 

Overall, I'll be back to have their food again!

Sal's is a decent hot chicken spot in Plano. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was solid, but nothing overly special. There are better options in the Dallas area. The chicken was flavorful and crispy and the medium spice level had a nice kick to it. The bun, however got a bit too soggy because the sauce was too thin. The Mac and cheese was not bad and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. Sal's is a good option for hot chicken and will satisfy the craving, but does not rank in the elite tier of hot chicken restaurants in Dallas.

4 stars
Very hot and fresh and delicious. Every bite was crispy and mouthwatering . Would definitely go again

5 stars
Hot chicken spots are found all over the place in the Dallas area.  This is my son and daughter in law's favorite.  We all tried something different and it was delicious.  I tried the medium spice that was almost too hot for me they all did the spicy  and my wife could have had the super spicy she said.  The fries were seasoned and cooked nicely. We have waffle and chicken, I had the waffle sandwich, and sin and wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  It was all terrific my waffle, chicken and slaw combined perfectly and add wing a little syrup to cut the heat is genius.   This family ran business was impeccably clean and service was great.
4.5 for the food, 5 service, and will definitely come back next time we are visiting.  This is the kids "Friday chicken" spot and I can see why.

1 stars
PLS DONT GO HERE the loaded fries are WAYYYY TOO good I am genuinely addicted, idk what they mix in their sauce how they make their chicken so tasty or how their fries are so flavor full but yet soo CRUNCHY and don't even get me started on the coleslaw, I used to hate coleslaw but they some how make it sooo good, i Repeat do not get the loaded fries you will be addicted.

4 stars
I stopped by Sal's this past Friday and ordered the chicken salad (medium heat) and maaaaan! I'm hooked, so hooked I had to try again to see if it was just my imagination, so I ordered the salad and the 4 piece chicken, both medium heat and yeah, it's confirmed.  It's damn good.   Good Job to the peeps at Sal's.

Posting again cause we went here again and we just love the sandwiches here! This time, however, we tried the loaded fries which were BOMB!! 
Service was quick and food was amazing just like before!

I love it so much, I drive 27 miles at lunch time to pick it up. Amazing service, delicious food, and the inside of the establishment is cozy.

The chicken tenders were large, but they had more of a panko breading.  I ordered the medium heat level, but I could not decern any spiciness at all.
The french fries were plentiful but flavorless.

Came here recently with family visiting us from out of town. It's been a while since we last came here since it's not exactly close.  The food was good so it was nice to see that they've maintained that level of quality. Since we had a big group we got to try a bunch of different things. Fried chicken is really good. Club sandwich is nice but not the Karachi style that I was hoping for. Loaded fries were loaded and Hot chicken sandwich is good as well.

So combine this with keds ice cream adjacent and you have a killer one-two meal combo.

They put bread under my three jumbo chicken tenders and i hate bread! Service is slow and takes a long time.

5 stars
Amazing food! The waffles and tender sliders had jalapeño mixed in to make for an amazing sweet and savory bite. The staff is awesome, letting us sample the newer skewers and giving us complementary chai!

Service was good and the food was amazing. I had a mild chicken sandwich with fries. It was fresh and tasty. 

Felt a bit grimy as most fried food places do.

5 stars
Omg I went to this spot a third time. That sweet and hot spice mix is sooo addictive. Super clean establishment. Food was so fresh, fully Halal. Cant beat chicken quality and flavor. Will be back again and again

5 stars
Wow what a hidden gem! My friends and I came here after realising pho texas is closed. I love myself a good chicken and waffle and this is definitely one of the better ones I've had!!

Service was fast even though we had about 12 of us walk in at the same time. All of their menu items were great. I would definitely come here again.

5 stars
Ordered through DoorDash and was very pleasantly surprised. Large portion size and so good. We will definitely recommend to others and be back.

3 stars
The service was good here. The hot chicken sandwich was the hot level, but to me it was not terribly hot imo.  The fries were good.  

For a combo at $13.99 I just didn't like the soda cup being small.  The meal price seemed a little high.

4 stars
We were not to be denied. A few days ago went to another hot chicken place but that one is permanently closed now. So rescheduled to come here to try it out. One of three hot chicken places nearby the rest in Dallas/Richardson. Check out photos of interior and food. We got serviced promptly and lots of it. We brought some home as leftovers. Just a few things keep it from 5 stars; no sweetner for ice tea, skimpy napkins (takes too many to clean up), not much for interior decoration. If not ready for hot chicken start with no spice or mild. It takes some getting used to impact on taste buds.

5 stars
Best chicken I've ever eaten, Halal too.Very crispy and moist, delicious sides, comes with a variety of sauces.Choose you spice level upon ordering. Great variety on the menu chicken, sandwiches, chicken & waffles. The staff are very attentive and courteous. I've ordered a 4 piece on several visits, and they often bonus me with 5 pieces

Been coming here for over a year now and have never been disappointed. The chicken is great, the slaw is great, and the fries are great. One thing to note is that their medium spicy level is more than adequate if you're not experienced in spice.

3 stars
Sorry had to leave because it smells like Sal's hot *ss  in there. The ambience is poor, nothing even close to Hot Chicks Nashville Hot Chicken. And don't make your customers wait while you talk on the phone, that's just being unappreciative.

5 stars
I ordered the 3 tender with fries - hot. Wow. It was very very good. The spice level was great and there was a great sweetness flavor. The fries were hot and crispy, the sauce was delicious as well! The service was great, friendly, and it took a bit to get the food, but it was very fresh so I don't care. It was clearly made when I ordered it and not just sitting under a lamp. 

I will be back, best Nashville Hot Chicken I have had in a long time!

5 stars
Not sure what "authentic" chicken tenders are supposed to taste like, but if these aren't authentic, I like my chicken tenders inauthentic. 

I got the mild ones and they're exactly as described; not very spicy but definitely full of flavor. The chicken was falling apart without me even having to use my knife, and it was very very juicy (see picture for proof). The sauce is very similar to canes sauce but seems to have more of a ketchup/mayonnaise base; it paired very well with the chicken.

Mac and cheese seems to maybe be made using Velveeta cheese (might be wrong). Not the best I've had but still very good. If I could have changed one thing I would have rather had melted cheese on top rather than the bread crumbs.   

The fries were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall this is probably one of the best halal chicken tenders places I've been to. I even tried it on a full stomach and was still very impressed. I look forward to going back and trying the spicy flavors.

5 stars
Came back to see if the place was still great.  Sandwich and fries still made to order.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had it spiced hot.  Fries were perfect too. Try this place!!

4 stars
Came for a weekday lunch. I got the standard Nashville Hot Sandwich (#1). It was delcious. I got Medium Spicy - level 3 of 5 - and it was indeed very spicy. I'm happy to know a place that actually makes them spicy, DFW tends to be very tame on these.

I subtracted one star because the staff lacked any enthusiasm and was very silent. The cash register girl barely spoke and seemed to hide out of sight when no one was waiting to pay. The man who brought me my food set it down without a word, not checking if I needed anything. 

I'm pleased enough by the food I'll come back, but it's disappointing they don't bring a fun attitude too. The original Hattie B's in Nashville is really fun.

3 stars
Sal's hot chicken is located practically next door to Popeye's and across the street from Raising Cane's so I'm very curious how well they do.

I had the chicken n waffles medium heat. Surprisingly the medium heat chicken had a dry powder coat and didn't look at wet and sticky as seen in the photos. That said, it was moist inside so I found it acceptable and medium seemed like an accurate description of the spice level.

It comes with one of the house comeback sauce which is a mayo and Worstershire blend similar to Cane's sauce or whatever other tangy pink blend that most restaurants tend to name after themselves. The sauce was fine but they only give you one for two big chicken strips and a second one is really needed. They charge 50 cents each which is always so offputting to me. I opted to try the honey mustard which is also mayo based as it often unfortunately is--honey mustard dressing is the most misleading named product since Grape Nuts, often containing neither mustard nor honey. Anyway both sauces were typical and adequate but average.

Ketchup bottles are on all the tables and they let you use as much ketchup as you want despite it not being any cheaper than the other condiments we've decided as a society to regress and allow to be treated as a premium. What wasn't on the table was salt and pepper so if you want your fries salty, you're out of luck here. That said, the fries weren't bad anyway but I strain to believe there's no salt in the building.

The waffles are cheddar jalapeño and frankly I wish they weren't. I haven't had hot chicken n waffles in Nashville, Tennessee so I can't speak to the authenticity of these decisions, but subjectively speaking, the cheddar was undetectable and the jalapeño flavor clashed with the chicken's spicy coating. I prefer my waffles to contrast with the chicken and normal or even sourdough would be preferable there. The included maple syrup was fine.

I felt this combo also needed one more thing. I've usually had hot chicken served with dill pickles so I was surprised there weren't any included. I see now on the menu they come with them on the chicken tenders only meals but not with the waffles and that's an odd decision. Also it looks like they don't given you much even then. Again I'm reminded of this awful trend of being selfish what used to be free unlimited condiments everywhere. They're still self serve at Dickey's. It's not like there's a cucumber shortage.

I see Coleslaw on the menu but I can't imagine it's worth the $4 they charge for it. Raising Cane's throw a slaw in their combo boxes. Feels like it should have been included here as well. Then also offer a mac and cheese for $4 and a dessert waffle for $7 and that all just seems overpriced to me when the chicken and waffle combo was already $13 in March 2024 prices and $2 more for a drink. I'm not even a boomer, y'all, but this stuff adds up.

So overall it's average. Popeyes is a better deal. Cane's is still more food for the money. But it's enough different that you might pick it sometimes anyway. If they let you have unlimited sauces and pickles and added slaw to the combos I would promote them. Unfortunately, I imagine that ship has sailed.

5 stars
Boy oh boy, was this delicious! We decided just to split an order of the loaded fries - and they were LOADED!! Crispy, delicious fries covered with their hot chicken, vinegar slaw, comeback sauce, and pickles. Oh my gosh, it was so good!! I'm looking forward to going back sometime for trying other things on the menu......but........I'm going to probably have to order the fries again!!! Service was pretty quick!! This place is worth the stop!!!

4 stars
Honestly this place was absolutely delicious. 
Regarding the food itself- 10/10. One of the best hot chicken places we have eaten at. 

Their sauce is well worth the additional 49 cents each. The pickles are delish, and their chicken is perfect. Not too much, and not too little. 

I ordered 3 tenders + fries. The fries were delicious and the tenders were huge, I only ended up eating 2. Thankfully the meal came with a sauce but I would have bought an additional sauce had I known.  
The reason I give this spot a 4 instead of 5 was service. We said for drink we'd like water and didn't receive cups... also when you're exiting and it's a small place it's nice when you hear a "thank you" from the staff.

4 stars
Tried their chicken sandwhich and I have time say the flavor is there and the sandwhich is pretty big and filling. Only complaint is that I felt the chicken was dry. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for more of a Juicy and soft chicken instead of a dry one. I think if they can find a good way to brine the chicken then it could be really good. The location is okay but kind of hard to see at first if you don't know. The outside doesn't look too special at first but once you go in, it's different then what the outside looks. Located in a grocery store complex at the end of the corner. The Google maps may direct you to the opposite side so make sure you drive to the end and you will see it.

5 stars
Really impressed by their vast menu, tried a lot of items. Really loved the sandwich, fried chicken, BBQ wings, and loaded fries. Delicious food and amazing service!!!

5 stars
Have eaten here before and loved it so decided to return. Purchased the loaded fries and chicken and waffles. Great combination of flavors and textures. Food tasted fresh. Staff was polite and professional. The location has been remodeled since my last visit. Bathrooms were clean. Would return.

Amazing Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Was hot and crispy, slaw, sauce and pickles were amazing. Hot fries were very good also. Our favorite Nashville Hot Chicken is Howdys in Sugar Land Texas but this was just as good.

5 stars
Stunning presentation, perfectly crispy, taste on point, and great price! Definitely a place I'd come back to try the other sandwhiches. We got our 8 piece chicken to go, broiled them a couple hours later..... still PERFECT! See y'all soon!

5 stars
Delicious food and excellent service! I will definitely be coming back soon! I love the zinger sandwich!

5 stars
Sal's is a cozy spot with loads of flavor. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the Zinger was delightful as well. We were so satisfied that we couldn't even manage to try the Hot Chicken & Waffles!

5 stars
Delicious!!! I had the Waff-wich.. hands down it was amazing! 

It's huge, I could barely finish half of it. And I'm a big girl that hadn't eaten all day.. so yeah there's more than enough to share. 

Waffle was cooked perfectly, soft and not too crunchy. The chicken was crispy, tender, juicy and flavorful. You can't go wrong. 

The prices are definitely worth it considering all the food you're getting and how delicious everything was.

Please give this place a shot!!

1 stars
Ordered club sandwich.
This was the worst sandwich
It looked like a tuna sandwich
..Terrible taste...It made my stomach sick...Unfortunately we did take out and was extremely hungry...This should be taken seriously...Never again will we eat there...30$ for us to get sick

4 stars
I would post a photo of the sandwich but I ate it to fast it was delish! Better than anticipated... I Just happen to be in the area place looks relatively new and the sign is NOT impressive but the food was (that's what counts.. Got their signature Nashville Hot Chicken (medium heat) 
Bun was buttery brioche perfectly done, chicken was juicy and cooked just right, batter good crisp not burnt or over greased , the slaw and the sauce was very very good. Overall ingredients tasted fresh and very delicious. I don't really give 5 stars to any fast food place but I would give 4.5 to this place !!! I definitely will be back.

4 stars
This is a solid success story that demonstrates what focusing on what you're good at AND taking customer feedback can do for your restaurant. They're serving up clearly fresh food, with portions that are consistently worth it, and the only concern is when it's not hot enough.

Service here is solid, they cover their bases of knowing the menu, having recommendations and keeping the dining area clean. There has been reports in lapses by the management, but the regular employees keep this place running well. They'll even happily accommodate *reasonable* requests and alterations for you. 

I've tried their menu a few times now, so I certainly can I say I have the full breadth of it, and the chicken remains consistent across items and visits. My only concern is quite literally the spice level, not because of it's inadequacy, but because you literally don't get the same flavor if you order below a Hot. Even the fried chicken becomes a new experience just by asking for the Hot Rub applied on top. If they figured out a way to bring that flavor from their spicier offerings down to the less able of consumers, they'd have their 5 star in the bag.

Fresh out the fryer, this revamp of an admittedly weak Peri-Peri spot found it's groove by switching over to what was really selling, the fried chicken sandwiches. With some more time and heeded advice, I'm sure they'll climb to the top of the DFW Halal scene. If you're spice inclined, definitely check this one out!

2 stars
It smells like old grease , the fries taste like old grease . I ordered the loaded fries . The loaded fries was cold , the sauce was ok and chicken was crispy and warm . The bag which I received my food was greasy . The gloves she used to prepare my food she also used to bag my food. The container was greasy , the fries paper was greasy and the actual bag was greasy . The people were nice .

5 stars
Everything came out so fresh and crispy. You should definitely try the wings! Super juicy and flavorful.

4 stars
Good food, good service, and good clean restaurant. The choices are limited as in fried chicken either in a bun or without with different toppings and sauces.

Having said that the food is cooked fresh and served hot. We got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Loaded Fries. The Loaded Fries are fries on fresh coleslaw topped with chopped fried chicken topped with your choice of sauce. I opted for medium spicy and it still had some heat. The sauce had a good spicy-sweet flavor with a slight tangy flavor. 

Overall a good experience.

5 stars
Great flavor. Great spice. Fresh, juicy chicken tenders. Well crafted chicken sandwiches. Some of the best honey mustard and house sauce we've had. We will be back!

5 stars
Hot Chicken is a new trend and this is definitely a place to try! Sal's Nashville Hot Chicken is located in Plano, TX, corner location and plenty of parking space. The service was quick and our food came out hot and fresh! Very crispy and full of flavor. I had the medium tenders and the heat level was just perfect.  I love spicy food. We also tried the loaded fries and mild tenders. The mild is definitely mild. So if you can't take the heat but want a bit of a spicy kick to the food, mild is your heat level! Overall, very delicious and will be coming back to try the sandwiches! 

Side note: we accidentally messed up and ordered the wrong item. The manager/owner was very kind and gracious and happily corrected it. Wonderful service and staff were super kind!

5 stars
I have been coming here at least once a week since I learned of it about 2 months ago. It's so consistently good every single time. Super spicy and flavorful in the best ways. Highly recommend!!! 

The one thing that will drive me away from places I frequent is inconsistency. THANK YOU for being consistent! Your food is delicious!

3 stars
We came here on a weeknight and tried the waffwich and loaded fries. The waffwich was definitely better and more flavorful. They make the waffles fresh, and I recommend eating that there or the waffles get soggy. We had the medium spice chicken on the waffwich and mild chicken on the loaded fries. The medium was pretty spicy...I'm scared to try the fiery hot. The loaded fries were lackluster and needed more tangier coleslaw and more sauce. Small suggestion for management: I recommend that the lady in the front put her hair in a net while handling other people's food.

5 stars
Ok, Sal's - nicely done. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars - the food is very good, I got the #1 chicken sandwich, fries and a drink combo. The sandwich was great - large piece of chicken, medium heat (just enough to taste it, not enough to regret it) - very surprised by the fries - they were excellent - light, fluffy, great balance between crispy and soft - and a large portion of them!

The kicker for me was the price - just a few dollars too high, but then again, isn't everything right now?! I thought about the chicken and waffles - I'll definitely try those next time. Couple next to me were back for the tenders - they love them! The loaded fries sounded great, but I was by myself and I think those would be best to split with others. 

Ok, so I changed it to 5 stars - I'm not going to let a couple dollars dictate the overall impression of this place - it's really, really good and you have to try it! Be careful of the heat - guy told me he got the hot last time and almost didn't live to regret it - so it's hot! 

Pretty decent lunch crowd for the location - there are so many other options on this Coit/Spring Creek corner - I hope Sal's makes it and keeps on offering a great Nashville Hot Chicken option - it's good.

5 stars
Amazing food - great service - ambiance very welcoming. The two arcade machines gave me nostalgic memories and the whole family enjoyed them. 

Food is always amazing.  We ordered fried chicken medium spice. It was amazing and flavorful reminds me of desi fried chicken back home.

Been coming here for over a year now and have never been disappointed. The chicken is great, the slaw is great, and the fries are great. One thing to note is that their medium spicy level is more than adequate if you're not experienced in spice.

Sorry had to leave because it smells like Sal's hot *ss  in there. The ambience is poor, nothing even close to Hot Chicks Nashville Hot Chicken. And don't make your customers wait while you talk on the phone, that's just being unappreciative.

I ordered the 3 tender with fries - hot. Wow. It was very very good. The spice level was great and there was a great sweetness flavor. The fries were hot and crispy, the sauce was delicious as well! The service was great, friendly, and it took a bit to get the food, but it was very fresh so I don't care. It was clearly made when I ordered it and not just sitting under a lamp. 

I will be back, best Nashville Hot Chicken I have had in a long time!

Not sure what "authentic" chicken tenders are supposed to taste like, but if these aren't authentic, I like my chicken tenders inauthentic. 

I got the mild ones and they're exactly as described; not very spicy but definitely full of flavor. The chicken was falling apart without me even having to use my knife, and it was very very juicy (see picture for proof). The sauce is very similar to canes sauce but seems to have more of a ketchup/mayonnaise base; it paired very well with the chicken.

Mac and cheese seems to maybe be made using Velveeta cheese (might be wrong). Not the best I've had but still very good. If I could have changed one thing I would have rather had melted cheese on top rather than the bread crumbs.   

The fries were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall this is probably one of the best halal chicken tenders places I've been to. I even tried it on a full stomach and was still very impressed. I look forward to going back and trying the spicy flavors.

Came back to see if the place was still great.  Sandwich and fries still made to order.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had it spiced hot.  Fries were perfect too. Try this place!!

Came for a weekday lunch. I got the standard Nashville Hot Sandwich (#1). It was delcious. I got Medium Spicy - level 3 of 5 - and it was indeed very spicy. I'm happy to know a place that actually makes them spicy, DFW tends to be very tame on these.

I subtracted one star because the staff lacked any enthusiasm and was very silent. The cash register girl barely spoke and seemed to hide out of sight when no one was waiting to pay. The man who brought me my food set it down without a word, not checking if I needed anything. 

I'm pleased enough by the food I'll come back, but it's disappointing they don't bring a fun attitude too. The original Hattie B's in Nashville is really fun.

Sal's hot chicken is located practically next door to Popeye's and across the street from Raising Cane's so I'm very curious how well they do.

I had the chicken n waffles medium heat. Surprisingly the medium heat chicken had a dry powder coat and didn't look at wet and sticky as seen in the photos. That said, it was moist inside so I found it acceptable and medium seemed like an accurate description of the spice level.

It comes with one of the house comeback sauce which is a mayo and Worstershire blend similar to Cane's sauce or whatever other tangy pink blend that most restaurants tend to name after themselves. The sauce was fine but they only give you one for two big chicken strips and a second one is really needed. They charge 50 cents each which is always so offputting to me. I opted to try the honey mustard which is also mayo based as it often unfortunately is--honey mustard dressing is the most misleading named product since Grape Nuts, often containing neither mustard nor honey. Anyway both sauces were typical and adequate but average.

Ketchup bottles are on all the tables and they let you use as much ketchup as you want despite it not being any cheaper than the other condiments we've decided as a society to regress and allow to be treated as a premium. What wasn't on the table was salt and pepper so if you want your fries salty, you're out of luck here. That said, the fries weren't bad anyway but I strain to believe there's no salt in the building.

The waffles are cheddar jalapeño and frankly I wish they weren't. I haven't had hot chicken n waffles in Nashville, Tennessee so I can't speak to the authenticity of these decisions, but subjectively speaking, the cheddar was undetectable and the jalapeño flavor clashed with the chicken's spicy coating. I prefer my waffles to contrast with the chicken and normal or even sourdough would be preferable there. The included maple syrup was fine.

I felt this combo also needed one more thing. I've usually had hot chicken served with dill pickles so I was surprised there weren't any included. I see now on the menu they come with them on the chicken tenders only meals but not with the waffles and that's an odd decision. Also it looks like they don't given you much even then. Again I'm reminded of this awful trend of being selfish what used to be free unlimited condiments everywhere. They're still self serve at Dickey's. It's not like there's a cucumber shortage.

I see Coleslaw on the menu but I can't imagine it's worth the $4 they charge for it. Raising Cane's throw a slaw in their combo boxes. Feels like it should have been included here as well. Then also offer a mac and cheese for $4 and a dessert waffle for $7 and that all just seems overpriced to me when the chicken and waffle combo was already $13 in March 2024 prices and $2 more for a drink. I'm not even a boomer, y'all, but this stuff adds up.

So overall it's average. Popeyes is a better deal. Cane's is still more food for the money. But it's enough different that you might pick it sometimes anyway. If they let you have unlimited sauces and pickles and added slaw to the combos I would promote them. Unfortunately, I imagine that ship has sailed.

Boy oh boy, was this delicious! We decided just to split an order of the loaded fries - and they were LOADED!! Crispy, delicious fries covered with their hot chicken, vinegar slaw, comeback sauce, and pickles. Oh my gosh, it was so good!! I'm looking forward to going back sometime for trying other things on the menu......but........I'm going to probably have to order the fries again!!! Service was pretty quick!! This place is worth the stop!!!

4 stars
Honestly this place was absolutely delicious. 
Regarding the food itself- 10/10. One of the best hot chicken places we have eaten at. 

Their sauce is well worth the additional 49 cents each. The pickles are delish, and their chicken is perfect. Not too much, and not too little. 

I ordered 3 tenders + fries. The fries were delicious and the tenders were huge, I only ended up eating 2. Thankfully the meal came with a sauce but I would have bought an additional sauce had I known.  
The reason I give this spot a 4 instead of 5 was service. We said for drink we'd like water and didn't receive cups... also when you're exiting and it's a small place it's nice when you hear a "thank you" from the staff.

Tried their chicken sandwhich and I have time say the flavor is there and the sandwhich is pretty big and filling. Only complaint is that I felt the chicken was dry. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for more of a Juicy and soft chicken instead of a dry one. I think if they can find a good way to brine the chicken then it could be really good. The location is okay but kind of hard to see at first if you don't know. The outside doesn't look too special at first but once you go in, it's different then what the outside looks. Located in a grocery store complex at the end of the corner. The Google maps may direct you to the opposite side so make sure you drive to the end and you will see it.

Really impressed by their vast menu, tried a lot of items. Really loved the sandwich, fried chicken, BBQ wings, and loaded fries. Delicious food and amazing service!!!

Have eaten here before and loved it so decided to return. Purchased the loaded fries and chicken and waffles. Great combination of flavors and textures. Food tasted fresh. Staff was polite and professional. The location has been remodeled since my last visit. Bathrooms were clean. Would return.

Amazing Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Was hot and crispy, slaw, sauce and pickles were amazing. Hot fries were very good also. Our favorite Nashville Hot Chicken is Howdys in Sugar Land Texas but this was just as good.

5 stars
Stunning presentation, perfectly crispy, taste on point, and great price! Definitely a place I'd come back to try the other sandwhiches. We got our 8 piece chicken to go, broiled them a couple hours later..... still PERFECT! See y'all soon!

Delicious food and excellent service! I will definitely be coming back soon! I love the zinger sandwich!

5 stars
Sal's is a cozy spot with loads of flavor. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the Zinger was delightful as well. We were so satisfied that we couldn't even manage to try the Hot Chicken & Waffles!

5 stars
Delicious!!! I had the Waff-wich.. hands down it was amazing! 

It's huge, I could barely finish half of it. And I'm a big girl that hadn't eaten all day.. so yeah there's more than enough to share. 

Waffle was cooked perfectly, soft and not too crunchy. The chicken was crispy, tender, juicy and flavorful. You can't go wrong. 

The prices are definitely worth it considering all the food you're getting and how delicious everything was.

Please give this place a shot!!

..Terrible taste...It made my stomach sick...Unfortunately we did take out and was extremely hungry...This should be taken seriously...Never again will we eat there...30$ for us to get sick

4 stars
I would post a photo of the sandwich but I ate it to fast it was delish! Better than anticipated... I Just happen to be in the area place looks relatively new and the sign is NOT impressive but the food was (that's what counts.. Got their signature Nashville Hot Chicken (medium heat) 
Bun was buttery brioche perfectly done, chicken was juicy and cooked just right, batter good crisp not burnt or over greased , the slaw and the sauce was very very good. Overall ingredients tasted fresh and very delicious. I don't really give 5 stars to any fast food place but I would give 4.5 to this place !!! I definitely will be back.

This is a solid success story that demonstrates what focusing on what you're good at AND taking customer feedback can do for your restaurant. They're serving up clearly fresh food, with portions that are consistently worth it, and the only concern is when it's not hot enough.

Service here is solid, they cover their bases of knowing the menu, having recommendations and keeping the dining area clean. There has been reports in lapses by the management, but the regular employees keep this place running well. They'll even happily accommodate *reasonable* requests and alterations for you. 

I've tried their menu a few times now, so I certainly can I say I have the full breadth of it, and the chicken remains consistent across items and visits. My only concern is quite literally the spice level, not because of it's inadequacy, but because you literally don't get the same flavor if you order below a Hot. Even the fried chicken becomes a new experience just by asking for the Hot Rub applied on top. If they figured out a way to bring that flavor from their spicier offerings down to the less able of consumers, they'd have their 5 star in the bag.

Fresh out the fryer, this revamp of an admittedly weak Peri-Peri spot found it's groove by switching over to what was really selling, the fried chicken sandwiches. With some more time and heeded advice, I'm sure they'll climb to the top of the DFW Halal scene. If you're spice inclined, definitely check this one out!

It smells like old grease , the fries taste like old grease . I ordered the loaded fries . The loaded fries was cold , the sauce was ok and chicken was crispy and warm . The bag which I received my food was greasy . The gloves she used to prepare my food she also used to bag my food. The container was greasy , the fries paper was greasy and the actual bag was greasy . The people were nice .

Everything came out so fresh and crispy. You should definitely try the wings! Super juicy and flavorful.

4 stars
Good food, good service, and good clean restaurant. The choices are limited as in fried chicken either in a bun or without with different toppings and sauces.

Having said that the food is cooked fresh and served hot. We got a Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Loaded Fries. The Loaded Fries are fries on fresh coleslaw topped with chopped fried chicken topped with your choice of sauce. I opted for medium spicy and it still had some heat. The sauce had a good spicy-sweet flavor with a slight tangy flavor. 

Overall a good experience.

Great flavor. Great spice. Fresh, juicy chicken tenders. Well crafted chicken sandwiches. Some of the best honey mustard and house sauce we've had. We will be back!

Hot Chicken is a new trend and this is definitely a place to try! Sal's Nashville Hot Chicken is located in Plano, TX, corner location and plenty of parking space. The service was quick and our food came out hot and fresh! Very crispy and full of flavor. I had the medium tenders and the heat level was just perfect.  I love spicy food. We also tried the loaded fries and mild tenders. The mild is definitely mild. So if you can't take the heat but want a bit of a spicy kick to the food, mild is your heat level! Overall, very delicious and will be coming back to try the sandwiches! 

Side note: we accidentally messed up and ordered the wrong item. The manager/owner was very kind and gracious and happily corrected it. Wonderful service and staff were super kind!

5 stars
I have been coming here at least once a week since I learned of it about 2 months ago. It's so consistently good every single time. Super spicy and flavorful in the best ways. Highly recommend!!! 

The one thing that will drive me away from places I frequent is inconsistency. THANK YOU for being consistent! Your food is delicious!

We came here on a weeknight and tried the waffwich and loaded fries. The waffwich was definitely better and more flavorful. They make the waffles fresh, and I recommend eating that there or the waffles get soggy. We had the medium spice chicken on the waffwich and mild chicken on the loaded fries. The medium was pretty spicy...I'm scared to try the fiery hot. The loaded fries were lackluster and needed more tangier coleslaw and more sauce. Small suggestion for management: I recommend that the lady in the front put her hair in a net while handling other people's food.

Ok, Sal's - nicely done. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars - the food is very good, I got the #1 chicken sandwich, fries and a drink combo. The sandwich was great - large piece of chicken, medium heat (just enough to taste it, not enough to regret it) - very surprised by the fries - they were excellent - light, fluffy, great balance between crispy and soft - and a large portion of them!

The kicker for me was the price - just a few dollars too high, but then again, isn't everything right now?! I thought about the chicken and waffles - I'll definitely try those next time. Couple next to me were back for the tenders - they love them! The loaded fries sounded great, but I was by myself and I think those would be best to split with others. 

Ok, so I changed it to 5 stars - I'm not going to let a couple dollars dictate the overall impression of this place - it's really, really good and you have to try it! Be careful of the heat - guy told me he got the hot last time and almost didn't live to regret it - so it's hot! 

Pretty decent lunch crowd for the location - there are so many other options on this Coit/Spring Creek corner - I hope Sal's makes it and keeps on offering a great Nashville Hot Chicken option - it's good.
