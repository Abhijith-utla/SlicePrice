Every bite is so fresh and delicious in every dish we've ever tried here. Even the rice somehow tastes better than anywhere else. 
Seafood, veggies, spices, soup dumplings, fried and steamed dumplings, garlic pepper shrimp, everything was just so unbelievably tasty. 
This place is fail-proof! 
And the chocolate dumplings are worth the trip alone!

3 stars
I will see they have a ton of parking and the staff is very nice, but the food is kind of mid.

I got the soup dumplings and they were really good, but I don't think I've ever had soup dumplings that I don't like. With a decent amount of meat inside and the dumpling wrapper didn't fall apart so easily that I lost all soup in transit . I would totally get these again.

The big bummer was the DanDan noodles. They were way too vinegar tasting, and didn't have almost any other flavoring. I even left most of the meat because it was kind of flavorless.

Really liked this place! I had the lunch special for $12.99 which included hot and sour soup (delicious!), an egg roll, and a choice of American-Chinese cuisine (I had orange chicken, there was general Tsao's, that sort of thing). However they also had xiao long bao, a variety of pan fried and steamed dumplings, and other authentic fare. I liked it so much I ended up ordering an entire meal for my family for later  I ordered traditional soup dumplings, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, chicken chow mein, took my leftovers (which was a lot!), and an order of their own design, chocolate soup dumplings! I have bamboo steam baskets at home so it was easy to reheat things. My family raved and my kids gobbled it up. 

I sat near the owner who was the absolute nicest - he is French and his partner/girlfriend is from Hong Kong. They just took it over 4 months ago and made some nice changes to the inside and menu changes as well. The kitchen staff is still the same. 

Go try it!!

Very aesthetically pleasing, service was great and attentive, good location, I've been to several different dumping locations and unfortunately this is one of the ones that I didn't like. The soup dumplings were not good tasting, the walnut shrimp had too much mayonnaise and the shrimps were low quality, the cucumber salad had a ginger flavor instead of a garlic flavor but maybe that's they way it was supposed to be just not good in flavor. The green onion pancakes were delicious and the fried pork chive dumplings were good. 

Thanks for the experience.

I thought Dumplings House was on par with my expectations. It is a smaller restaurant than I was expecting. Got the sesame chicken, onion pancake and of course, dumplings. Everything was great. It just seemed pricier than what we received but I think that's just the world we live in. Because of proximity, not sure if we would come again but if a group came we certainly would be back.

4 stars
I've been here years ago and it's still very good! We ordered the pork with chives pan fried dumplings(very tasty and crispy)! We saw that they had a lunch special with come with soup and spring roll! I had the sesame chicken (there were too much sauce but it was tasty), my husband had the Mongolian beef which had way too much sauce, the portion was huge, a lot more than my sesame chicken! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful! I would definitely go back and tried other entrees!

5 stars
Just revisited dumpling house again after being takeout only customers for the last year and had such an amazing experience! They have completely updated the space and it is so welcoming. 

We ordered a bunch of dumplings and buns for our table and they all came out steaming hot and flavorful. The Mapo Tofu was bursting with flavor and the perfect amount of mouth numbing spice! I have realized over the years that there is truly not one thing on this menu that isn't absolutely delicious from the orange chicken to the seasonal soup dumpling you can't go wrong! 

Not only was all the food delicious as always but the owner, Irene, and server were so attentive and kind to us during our visit. Even offering a free sample of the hot and sour soup which I HIGHLY recommend and will be ordering every visit from now on! Don't miss this hidden gem for take out or dine in with a large group because it is the best combination of affordable, well run and delicious!

Always trying to support small businesses, we made a stop at Dumpling House. We tried a variety of things from the menu, which was all a bit lackluster. 

Beef pancakes: 3/5 lots of soup inside and crispy on the outside! Wish it was a little more flavorful but overall pretty decent

Beef rolls: 2/5 not bad! It could just use some more sauce and could be fried a little crispier

Braised beef noodle soup: 2/5 broth was too salty and lacked depth in flavor. Noodles were ok but nothing special. Would recommend skipping this and getting some other options on the menu 

Soup dumplings (pork): 2/5 decent filling and had a lot of soup inside! But not very rich in flavor and the wrappers were much too thick

String beans with minced pork: 5/5 easily the best dish we got! Hard to go wrong, and there was a lot of pork bits to add to the flavor!

House signature handmade bao: 3/5 these were definitely one of the better things on the menu! Felt homemade but not particularly memorable. 

Overall, somewhat decent food, and the staff was exceptionally kind! Maybe we just didn't order the right 
things!

5 stars
We have been looking for a great Chinese place to start frequenting and we have finally found our spot!! My husband said the fried dumpling was the BEST he's ever had. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (so crispy even with lots of sauce), and the chow mein was so flavorful! The staff were super nice and the hostess was a really sweetie!

1 stars
This looks like they had the same menu at one time as the Frisco location but it is pared down now. Soda is by the can with no free refills. 2025 is not starting out well for them. The heating doesn't work. They put a tiny space heater across from our table when we sat down. We were the only customers Friday at lunch-never a good sign. A lady was running an old wet rag across the tables, leaving everything sopping wet, then proceeded to put thin paper napkins on top of the wet table. We sat there for about 10 minutes trying to flag down someone to take our order. They saw us, we were the only people there, but just never came to take our order. We got up and left and they didn't seem surprised. This area of Plano used to be thriving, now it looks like a ghost town. Maybe if they get the heating fixed things will improve. I doubt I'll be back

1 stars
I really liked the dumplings here, but the customer service was really bad today. I ordered to-go on the phone and patiently waited as the lady asked me to hold several times. I didn't mind waiting since I understand it can get busy sometimes. So what happened was that they got my order wrong after I repeated my order and the lady repeated it back to me at least 5 times. The same lady called me back when my friend went to pick it up and asked if I ordered pork and cabbage when I clearly said pork and chives and she even repeated back my order correctly. The issue today was that she was extremely rude on the phone when she called back to confirm and even hung up on me when I told her that I ordered pork and chives. My friend that went to pick it up confirmed she hung up on me while shaking her head and looking really pissed.

5 stars
If you're craving dumplings, this place will satisfy that craving. They offer a lot of dumpling flavors (pork, chicken, veggie, fish, etc). We've tried a lot of different ones and they're all tasty. My go-to is still the classic pork dumpling. You can choose to get dumplings steamed or pan fried. Order a mix to try different kinds!

5 stars
We enjoyed every single thing that we ordered. Great quality food for a decent price. Service was great but we were told to sit anywhere when we entered but none of the tables seemed clean.

3 stars
This place was pretty good, my favorite thing was the flat rice noodles with beef! The soup dumplings and wontons and spicy sauce had a spicy/sour taste to them which was different and not my preference. The service was pretty good considering it was close to their closing time.

5 stars
This restaurant is a gem! My family and I have been there twice in two weeks, and this place is definitely now on our go-to list. So far we've tried the Orange Chicken, the Xaio Long Bao, the pork and the shrimp dumplings, the pork and chive dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, the crab rangoons, the green onion pancakes, the eggplant in garlic sauce (melt in your mouth!) the braised pork belly with cabbage (OMG....DELISH!), the sizzling beef, the innovative hot chocolate ganache dumplings and a few other dishes that I can't recall right now. 

Having been a chef in the food industry for many years, I notice things like how clean a place it....this place is impeccably clean with a lovely ambiance, and how professionally the food is prepared and served....this place has 5 stars in that category. The seasonings are just right, clean, fresh, neither under spiced nor over spiced. Absolutely perfect for the discerning palate. Last but not least, the owners and waitstaff are incredibly kind and accommodating, making sure that everyone has an excellent dining experience. The new owners have recently reopened and redecorated this restaurant, and revamped their menu to suit everyone's tastebuds. You must try the new Dumpling house on Parker Rd!

4 stars
I went to try this Chinese Dumpling House hidden inside a mini mall on West Parker Road, Plano TX.

I ordered Mongolian Beef from their lunch menu with white rice, hot and sour soup and egg roll included. The beef were thinly sliced and saut√©ed in onions and hosein sauce. It's delicious .

Serving Staff is friendly and helpful. The place is not fully lighted, kind a dark during lunchtime. But area is clean and well decorated. 

I will try handmade buns next time.

5 stars
The dumplings were truly amazing! The hostess was friendly and took the time to explain various food choices. She didn't push any upsells or direct me toward anything specific. The food was just as I had envisioned, especially the Mongolian beef, which looked exactly like the photo online. The beef and onion pancakes, pork and chive pan-fried dumplings, and beef short rib clay pot were all fantastic as well! I would definitely go back for more!

5 stars
Came for a light lunch on a weekend day to fuel up before we ran some errands before the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Began with the Green Onion Pancakes and Crab Rangoons. Both were excellent!! Really loved making a dipping sauce out of the Chili-Crisp and soy sauce. Both condiments readily available on your table; a nice touch!

Then we split the signature Soup Dumplings with ground pork and savory broth. We both had never had these before and were eager to try them! They were fantastic!!  Our glasses were kept full and waitstaff was attentive and the service was excellent. Costs were very appropriate for the amount of food. 

Definitely adding this to our restaurant rotation, as there's about a dozen other things on their menu I'm eager to try! I'm looking forward to trying their Pork and Chive Steamed buns, Crispy Spicy Chicken, and their dessert Chocolate Soup Dumplings sounds really intriguing!!  I didn't get any photos this time, but will do better next time.

5 stars
Everything was so good today but the new "Cheeseburger" Dumplings on the Seasonal Menu are unbelievable.  With a dab of Mustard, you will think it's a Cheeseburger.  And for dessert you must try the Chocolate Molten Boa Bun with walnuts.  Delish!!!!

4 stars
I think Dumpling House has changed ownership or just their name to Willow and Pine Dumpling House as of February 2024. We came for dinner, and I haven't been to this location in a few years, but the interior is revamped and looks more modern and inviting than it had before. Their dumplings and bao are still the stars of their menu. 

We got the boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork bao, both of which were delicious. The pork bao were very fluffy and soft, and while biting into the meat at first seemed somewhat bland, the more bites you took the more flavor seemed to come, and it was tastier the more you ate it. We also had the spicy garlic eggplant and a vegetable lo mein, which they said was vegetarian, not vegan, but we asked them to make the lo mein vegan for our friend to be able to eat and they were accomodating. These two dishes were okay, not amazing. The spicy garlic eggplant came with a small bowl of rice, and it could have been more generous. 

I do want to mention that the tableware we were given was a random mishmash; one person got a bowl and soup spoon that no one else got, three of us were given disposable chopsticks while one was given the resuable kind, and half the plates we were given were circular and half were oval-shaped. So they maybe need to work on attention to details in this aspect of restauranting! 

Also, the big menu with pictures was new and did not contain prices, and we had to ask for the prices of the dishes, which they handed to us on a longer paper menu. The dishes were still really good value, in my opinion.

The staff were nice and accommodating when we asked questions, and they came by to refill our waters pretty often. Overall, I think we had a pretty good experience, though it could be improved.

5 stars
Irene was so helpful on explaining their different types of dumplings. They were all fantastic!  Started with hot and sour soup. Arrived piping hot!   Yummy!!  Won ton soup was very tasty, the broth was full of flavor and the won tons were huge, very generous portions. The pork mdumplings we had fried and they disappeared immediately upon arrival. The steamed shrimp and pork dumplings  were generous too.  Such great fresh dishes.  We will be back!

5 stars
My husband and I decided to have dinner here Sunday night on a whim. This place is amazing. We ordered the scallion pancake, the beef roll, crab rangoons, soup dumplings, pork green beans and orange chicken. The food here tasted so authentic, the staff were super sweet and the food came out fast. My husband is usually a picky eater, and he loved the food. We live an hour away, but we definitely plan to make the trip to come back and eat here. This place is a hidden gem.

5 stars
Very good quiet little place. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all. The dumplings were delicious.  The service was great. We will go back.

4 stars
Happy I found a place I like in Plano. The Lo Mein was flavorful and very garlicky (might not be everyone's cup of tea), but a tad salty. The dumplings were amazing! The dough wasn't too thick, the filling was delicious and juicing, and the pan fried crust was perfectly done. 

Service was fast and friendly and parking was easy to come by.

5 stars
The food was delicious and the service was friendly, I'd definitely go back! I took some to go orders as well, package perfect for the trip.

Tucked away in the back corner of this shopping center is a Chinese restaurant that blew away my expectations. I went there on a Thursday night and expected it to be a ghost town, but it was surprisingly filled. Not packed to where it would be unpleasant, but enough people to let me know something was up. And surely enough, after trying the food, I understood why so many people were there.

I started with the egg drop soup, which had a nice deep umami flavor to set the tone. Next I tried my standard meal to test a Chinese restaurant: orange chicken with fried rice. The rice was cooked well with nice garnish of egg and garlic, but the real start was the orange chicken. Every bite was succulent, and I could tell they put time into refining the recipe. The flavor profile was a lovely balance of the sweetness from the orange itself (the dish was garnished with real orange peels) and the heat from the chilis. It was the perfect amount of heat for me -- enough to add to the flavor profile but not so much it became overpowering. I finished my meal with what has got to be this place's piece de resistance: chocolate soup dumplings.

The chocolate soup dumplings are to die for. They are worth a two hour drive to get to this place. Given this place literally has dumpling in their name I had high hopes, and they exceeded them. The chocolate soup dumplings look like any other soup dumpling, but when you bite into them you are greeted with a rush of molten chocolate that is rich and creamy. These things are crack, I recommend getting one order per person!

Overall this restaurant blew my expectations away. The staff was also very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was the star. I plan on making this place one of my regular go-to's.

Had a wonderful meal at Dumpling House. The staff was very kind and the food was great! 

The place is authentic, no frills, and portion sizes were generous.

Parking is easy, and adjacent to the restaurant right out right.

I met up yet again with some girlfriends after work.  The Dumpling House has a wide variety of different types of dumplings.  We each ordered from the menu to share so I can't remember exactly each item ordered however it was all delicious, fresh and tasty...see pictures! 

Note:  They do not have alcohol that you can order however you can BYOB

4 stars
This place executes quite well what they advertise in their name. 

Atmosphere wise this place is pretty separate and bland. Service is direct and to the point. Luckily, there English was decent enough that were both understood each other. 

Steamed buns here are pretty good. Great dough that has a pronounced yeast taste and smell as they probably make their own.

Fish dumplings are something I rarely see but they are pretty good here. Not amazing like when taught truffle or pork fat  are used but still tasty none the less. 

Custard buns sucked. They didn't have much filling and fell flat in flavor. Possibly the worst custard bun I've had. 

Scallion pancakes were even better than what you get at jeng chi! Maximum crispiness with plenty of oily goodness in each bite.

5 stars
Yum! Under new management and it was wonderful. It's been a while but I was impressed by the food and the service. They remodeled a bit too and it felt much more comfortable and modern.

We have been coming here for years. And I mean like 5 years and I felt it necessary to come back and update my review after our last visit a few days ago. 
We will start with my beef noodle soup that I always get. The meat was nice and tender like always. The soup however, was nothing but a over salted beef broth. I am used to this being a very flavorful broth that bursts in your mouth with every single bite. Not the case anymore. I did read that there might be a new owner or cook and maybe that explains why the dish was changed. 
Secondly, my fianc√© always gets the same chicken and noodle dish and it's always so much food that we have to take some home. The portion was much smaller this time. 
Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone. The whole rush of the "hurry up and order, eat and get out" feeling was super real. I do not like that. We would have left by 9:30 without any of the rushing around us. 
I do appreciate that we are still able to bring our own wine in to enjoy with our meal. 
I just feel that every customer, from the first to the last, should be treated as if they are wanted in the establishment. It costs a lot of money to treat yourself these days by going out to eat.

The food is amazing and wonderfully cooked! I love it so much I went twice in one week! Irene is the owner has been so awesome and even remembered my name. The Ambiance has been changed up and is awesome and more open now that the cocoon has been removed and has a more modern look.

As soon as you enter, you know if you are the target audience or not.

I was not the target audience for this establishment. The dishes are a bit pricey, the portions small, and look nothing like the pictures they have.

Beef roll looked like a skinny burrito.
Crispy pork were slivers of meat.
Dishes tasted like they came from premade packages.

There is more but as mentioned, not the target audience.

Food is excellent. Delicious, fresh me made and dare I say made with love?! It how it tastes. Quick and easy. Do yourself a favor just try it!

We came here on Sunday night. It was still early so there was no wait. We've been to the one in Frisco, but first time here at Plano location. 

There are good amount of seatings inside and family friendly ambiance. We had beef noodle soup, stir fry noodles, fried rice and beef wraps. Everything was so great and I feel like it's a lot better than the Frisco location. It's also less crowded!

Not good for me. The flat beef noodles were dry and the beef was super tough.  The sauce was good. Also the noodles were stuck together and some were hard.

Placed order here and the restaurant waited an hour to cancel it. Attempted to reorder again and the restaurant waited another 45 minutes to cancel order with no reason once more. Don't waste your time with this one.

This place is SOOO GOOD. Everything is perfect I got the dumplings, house signature bun (steamed) chicken fried rice and veggie lo mein. Everything is cooked to perfection ! The people in there took care of us and were super kind! I want to say we waited about 15-20 minutes but even just sitting inside felt so nostalgic ! The food is definitely authentic. Next time we'll stay to eat inside!

Food and service are disgusting. Dumplings are undercooked and tasted terrible. Also we took to-go and the rest of our Oder was wrong. I called to tell them and they said you ordered what you got. Don't waist your money. The food we received had NO FLAVOR!

1 stars
Pretty disappointed. Heard great things. We ordered house buns(didn't care for), fried pork and scallion dumplings(very good), soup dumplings(pretty good, beef roll(enjoyed this), and combo fried rice. They gave us lo mein and we didn't notice until we got home. Called to get it corrected and the kid hung up on us. Service was meh from the get go. Sad because this place may be really good but the staff has a bad attitude and doesn't really care. They're just there for a check and could care less about the customers.

First and last time!  I walked in to pick up a to go order, and stood at the register by the entrance for a solid 3 minutes in front of 2 employees. They finally said to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. I was asked "what I needed" as o said I'm here to pick up my order. I told him my name and he said what's your order number. I walked back out to the car to get my phone. I have them the order number he hands me my food. The whole exchange was weird and rude. The food sucked. The spicy pork was swimming in a pool of oil, the fried rice noodles with beef tasted like plastic, the orange chicken was chewy, and the egg rolls tasted off. I didn't even bother calling, as I didn't want to hear any excuses.

5 stars
We ordered several items and everything came out hot and fresh. The soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, steamed bun, and general tso chicken was some of the best we've had anywhere.

Obsessed. Every time I hear of someone going to North Dallas (regardless of reason) I recommend this place while aggressively insisting they bring me home lots of steam buns. The actual restaurant is unassuming and staff is helpful. Driving 45 minutes across the metroplex for these cherished buns was worth every ounce of stained tshirt and steering wheel! The mini-trek was a birthday well spent and well fed!

Having been a chef in the food industry for many years, I notice things like how clean a place it....this place is impeccably clean with a lovely ambiance, and how professionally the food is prepared and served....this place has 5 stars in that category. The seasonings are just right, clean, fresh, neither under spiced nor over spiced. Absolutely perfect for the discerning palate. Last but not least, the owners and waitstaff are incredibly kind and accommodating, making sure that everyone has an excellent dining experience. The new owners have recently reopened and redecorated this restaurant, and revamped their menu to suit everyone's tastebuds. You must try the new Dumpling house on Parker Rd!

I went to try this Chinese Dumpling House hidden inside a mini mall on West Parker Road, Plano TX.

I ordered Mongolian Beef from their lunch menu with white rice, hot and sour soup and egg roll included. The beef were thinly sliced and saut√©ed in onions and hosein sauce. It's delicious .

Serving Staff is friendly and helpful. The place is not fully lighted, kind a dark during lunchtime. But area is clean and well decorated. 

I will try handmade buns next time.

The dumplings were truly amazing! The hostess was friendly and took the time to explain various food choices. She didn't push any upsells or direct me toward anything specific. The food was just as I had envisioned, especially the Mongolian beef, which looked exactly like the photo online. The beef and onion pancakes, pork and chive pan-fried dumplings, and beef short rib clay pot were all fantastic as well! I would definitely go back for more!

Came for a light lunch on a weekend day to fuel up before we ran some errands before the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Began with the Green Onion Pancakes and Crab Rangoons. Both were excellent!! Really loved making a dipping sauce out of the Chili-Crisp and soy sauce. Both condiments readily available on your table; a nice touch!

Then we split the signature Soup Dumplings with ground pork and savory broth. We both had never had these before and were eager to try them! They were fantastic!!  Our glasses were kept full and waitstaff was attentive and the service was excellent. Costs were very appropriate for the amount of food. 

Definitely adding this to our restaurant rotation, as there's about a dozen other things on their menu I'm eager to try! I'm looking forward to trying their Pork and Chive Steamed buns, Crispy Spicy Chicken, and their dessert Chocolate Soup Dumplings sounds really intriguing!!  I didn't get any photos this time, but will do better next time.

5 stars
Everything was so good today but the new "Cheeseburger" Dumplings on the Seasonal Menu are unbelievable.  With a dab of Mustard, you will think it's a Cheeseburger.  And for dessert you must try the Chocolate Molten Boa Bun with walnuts.  Delish!!!!

I think Dumpling House has changed ownership or just their name to Willow and Pine Dumpling House as of February 2024. We came for dinner, and I haven't been to this location in a few years, but the interior is revamped and looks more modern and inviting than it had before. Their dumplings and bao are still the stars of their menu. 

We got the boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork bao, both of which were delicious. The pork bao were very fluffy and soft, and while biting into the meat at first seemed somewhat bland, the more bites you took the more flavor seemed to come, and it was tastier the more you ate it. We also had the spicy garlic eggplant and a vegetable lo mein, which they said was vegetarian, not vegan, but we asked them to make the lo mein vegan for our friend to be able to eat and they were accomodating. These two dishes were okay, not amazing. The spicy garlic eggplant came with a small bowl of rice, and it could have been more generous. 

I do want to mention that the tableware we were given was a random mishmash; one person got a bowl and soup spoon that no one else got, three of us were given disposable chopsticks while one was given the resuable kind, and half the plates we were given were circular and half were oval-shaped. So they maybe need to work on attention to details in this aspect of restauranting! 

Also, the big menu with pictures was new and did not contain prices, and we had to ask for the prices of the dishes, which they handed to us on a longer paper menu. The dishes were still really good value, in my opinion.

The staff were nice and accommodating when we asked questions, and they came by to refill our waters pretty often. Overall, I think we had a pretty good experience, though it could be improved.

Irene was so helpful on explaining their different types of dumplings. They were all fantastic!  Started with hot and sour soup. Arrived piping hot!   Yummy!!  Won ton soup was very tasty, the broth was full of flavor and the won tons were huge, very generous portions. The pork mdumplings we had fried and they disappeared immediately upon arrival. The steamed shrimp and pork dumplings  were generous too.  Such great fresh dishes.  We will be back!

5 stars
My husband and I decided to have dinner here Sunday night on a whim. This place is amazing. We ordered the scallion pancake, the beef roll, crab rangoons, soup dumplings, pork green beans and orange chicken. The food here tasted so authentic, the staff were super sweet and the food came out fast. My husband is usually a picky eater, and he loved the food. We live an hour away, but we definitely plan to make the trip to come back and eat here. This place is a hidden gem.

5 stars
Very good quiet little place. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all. The dumplings were delicious.  The service was great. We will go back.

Happy I found a place I like in Plano. The Lo Mein was flavorful and very garlicky (might not be everyone's cup of tea), but a tad salty. The dumplings were amazing! The dough wasn't too thick, the filling was delicious and juicing, and the pan fried crust was perfectly done. 

Service was fast and friendly and parking was easy to come by.

The food was delicious and the service was friendly, I'd definitely go back! I took some to go orders as well, package perfect for the trip.

Tucked away in the back corner of this shopping center is a Chinese restaurant that blew away my expectations. I went there on a Thursday night and expected it to be a ghost town, but it was surprisingly filled. Not packed to where it would be unpleasant, but enough people to let me know something was up. And surely enough, after trying the food, I understood why so many people were there.

I started with the egg drop soup, which had a nice deep umami flavor to set the tone. Next I tried my standard meal to test a Chinese restaurant: orange chicken with fried rice. The rice was cooked well with nice garnish of egg and garlic, but the real start was the orange chicken. Every bite was succulent, and I could tell they put time into refining the recipe. The flavor profile was a lovely balance of the sweetness from the orange itself (the dish was garnished with real orange peels) and the heat from the chilis. It was the perfect amount of heat for me -- enough to add to the flavor profile but not so much it became overpowering. I finished my meal with what has got to be this place's piece de resistance: chocolate soup dumplings.

The chocolate soup dumplings are to die for. They are worth a two hour drive to get to this place. Given this place literally has dumpling in their name I had high hopes, and they exceeded them. The chocolate soup dumplings look like any other soup dumpling, but when you bite into them you are greeted with a rush of molten chocolate that is rich and creamy. These things are crack, I recommend getting one order per person!

Overall this restaurant blew my expectations away. The staff was also very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was the star. I plan on making this place one of my regular go-to's.

Had a wonderful meal at Dumpling House. The staff was very kind and the food was great! 

The place is authentic, no frills, and portion sizes were generous.

Parking is easy, and adjacent to the restaurant right out right.

I met up yet again with some girlfriends after work.  The Dumpling House has a wide variety of different types of dumplings.  We each ordered from the menu to share so I can't remember exactly each item ordered however it was all delicious, fresh and tasty...see pictures! 

Note:  They do not have alcohol that you can order however you can BYOB

4 stars
This place executes quite well what they advertise in their name. 

Atmosphere wise this place is pretty separate and bland. Service is direct and to the point. Luckily, there English was decent enough that were both understood each other. 

Steamed buns here are pretty good. Great dough that has a pronounced yeast taste and smell as they probably make their own.

Fish dumplings are something I rarely see but they are pretty good here. Not amazing like when taught truffle or pork fat  are used but still tasty none the less. 

Custard buns sucked. They didn't have much filling and fell flat in flavor. Possibly the worst custard bun I've had. 

Scallion pancakes were even better than what you get at jeng chi! Maximum crispiness with plenty of oily goodness in each bite.

5 stars
Yum! Under new management and it was wonderful. It's been a while but I was impressed by the food and the service. They remodeled a bit too and it felt much more comfortable and modern.

4 stars
We have been coming here for years. And I mean like 5 years and I felt it necessary to come back and update my review after our last visit a few days ago. 
We will start with my beef noodle soup that I always get. The meat was nice and tender like always. The soup however, was nothing but a over salted beef broth. I am used to this being a very flavorful broth that bursts in your mouth with every single bite. Not the case anymore. I did read that there might be a new owner or cook and maybe that explains why the dish was changed. 
Secondly, my fianc√© always gets the same chicken and noodle dish and it's always so much food that we have to take some home. The portion was much smaller this time. 
Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone. The whole rush of the "hurry up and order, eat and get out" feeling was super real. I do not like that. We would have left by 9:30 without any of the rushing around us. 
I do appreciate that we are still able to bring our own wine in to enjoy with our meal. 
I just feel that every customer, from the first to the last, should be treated as if they are wanted in the establishment. It costs a lot of money to treat yourself these days by going out to eat.

5 stars
My first visit to the Dumpling House in Plano, and the food is terrific!  Service was quick as well and it made for a delicious lunch.

5 stars
The food is amazing, I've enjoyed it twice this week.  Go to place for me. The Orange Chicken is one of the best I have had.  Everything is fresh and tasty.

5 stars
The food is amazing and wonderfully cooked! I love it so much I went twice in one week! Irene is the owner has been so awesome and even remembered my name. The Ambiance has been changed up and is awesome and more open now that the cocoon has been removed and has a more modern look.

1 stars
As soon as you enter, you know if you are the target audience or not.

I was not the target audience for this establishment. The dishes are a bit pricey, the portions small, and look nothing like the pictures they have.

Beef roll looked like a skinny burrito.
Crispy pork were slivers of meat.
Dishes tasted like they came from premade packages.

There is more but as mentioned, not the target audience.

5 stars
Food is excellent. Delicious, fresh me made and dare I say made with love?! It how it tastes. Quick and easy. Do yourself a favor just try it!

I stumbled upon this gem some years back. I have always loved their food and had to come back after a few years of being away. We ordered the fried pork and scallion dumplings, and curry noodles were delicious!

The Jalape√±o cilantro rice and combination fried rice is so good! Great service. We will be coming again :)

Poor service. Our server seemed very agitated to get us water, napkins, and straws. The soup dumplings had a sour aftertaste.. not very good compared to others i've had.

Very kind customer service and the food here is delicious would recommend trying thus place out if you haven't yet

We came here on Sunday night. It was still early so there was no wait. We've been to the one in Frisco, but first time here at Plano location. 

There are good amount of seatings inside and family friendly ambiance. We had beef noodle soup, stir fry noodles, fried rice and beef wraps. Everything was so great and I feel like it's a lot better than the Frisco location. It's also less crowded!

1 stars
Not good for me. The flat beef noodles were dry and the beef was super tough.  The sauce was good. Also the noodles were stuck together and some were hard.

1 stars
Placed order here and the restaurant waited an hour to cancel it. Attempted to reorder again and the restaurant waited another 45 minutes to cancel order with no reason once more. Don't waste your time with this one.

5 stars
This place is SOOO GOOD. Everything is perfect I got the dumplings, house signature bun (steamed) chicken fried rice and veggie lo mein. Everything is cooked to perfection ! The people in there took care of us and were super kind! I want to say we waited about 15-20 minutes but even just sitting inside felt so nostalgic ! The food is definitely authentic. Next time we'll stay to eat inside!

1 stars
Food and service are disgusting. Dumplings are undercooked and tasted terrible. Also we took to-go and the rest of our Oder was wrong. I called to tell them and they said you ordered what you got. Don't waist your money. The food we received had NO FLAVOR!

1 stars
Pretty disappointed. Heard great things. We ordered house buns(didn't care for), fried pork and scallion dumplings(very good), soup dumplings(pretty good, beef roll(enjoyed this), and combo fried rice. They gave us lo mein and we didn't notice until we got home. Called to get it corrected and the kid hung up on us. Service was meh from the get go. Sad because this place may be really good but the staff has a bad attitude and doesn't really care. They're just there for a check and could care less about the customers.

1 stars
First and last time!  I walked in to pick up a to go order, and stood at the register by the entrance for a solid 3 minutes in front of 2 employees. They finally said to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. I was asked "what I needed" as o said I'm here to pick up my order. I told him my name and he said what's your order number. I walked back out to the car to get my phone. I have them the order number he hands me my food. The whole exchange was weird and rude. The food sucked. The spicy pork was swimming in a pool of oil, the fried rice noodles with beef tasted like plastic, the orange chicken was chewy, and the egg rolls tasted off. I didn't even bother calling, as I didn't want to hear any excuses.

5 stars
We ordered several items and everything came out hot and fresh. The soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, steamed bun, and general tso chicken was some of the best we've had anywhere.

5 stars
Obsessed. Every time I hear of someone going to North Dallas (regardless of reason) I recommend this place while aggressively insisting they bring me home lots of steam buns. The actual restaurant is unassuming and staff is helpful. Driving 45 minutes across the metroplex for these cherished buns was worth every ounce of stained tshirt and steering wheel! The mini-trek was a birthday well spent and well fed!

5 stars
Every bite is so fresh and delicious in every dish we've ever tried here. Even the rice somehow tastes better than anywhere else. 
Seafood, veggies, spices, soup dumplings, fried and steamed dumplings, garlic pepper shrimp, everything was just so unbelievably tasty. 
This place is fail-proof! 
And the chocolate dumplings are worth the trip alone!

3 stars
I will see they have a ton of parking and the staff is very nice, but the food is kind of mid.

I got the soup dumplings and they were really good, but I don't think I've ever had soup dumplings that I don't like. With a decent amount of meat inside and the dumpling wrapper didn't fall apart so easily that I lost all soup in transit . I would totally get these again.

The big bummer was the DanDan noodles. They were way too vinegar tasting, and didn't have almost any other flavoring. I even left most of the meat because it was kind of flavorless.

5 stars
Really liked this place! I had the lunch special for $12.99 which included hot and sour soup (delicious!), an egg roll, and a choice of American-Chinese cuisine (I had orange chicken, there was general Tsao's, that sort of thing). However they also had xiao long bao, a variety of pan fried and steamed dumplings, and other authentic fare. I liked it so much I ended up ordering an entire meal for my family for later  I ordered traditional soup dumplings, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, chicken chow mein, took my leftovers (which was a lot!), and an order of their own design, chocolate soup dumplings! I have bamboo steam baskets at home so it was easy to reheat things. My family raved and my kids gobbled it up. 

I sat near the owner who was the absolute nicest - he is French and his partner/girlfriend is from Hong Kong. They just took it over 4 months ago and made some nice changes to the inside and menu changes as well. The kitchen staff is still the same. 

Go try it!!

3 stars
Very aesthetically pleasing, service was great and attentive, good location, I've been to several different dumping locations and unfortunately this is one of the ones that I didn't like. The soup dumplings were not good tasting, the walnut shrimp had too much mayonnaise and the shrimps were low quality, the cucumber salad had a ginger flavor instead of a garlic flavor but maybe that's they way it was supposed to be just not good in flavor. The green onion pancakes were delicious and the fried pork chive dumplings were good. 

Thanks for the experience.

4 stars
I thought Dumplings House was on par with my expectations. It is a smaller restaurant than I was expecting. Got the sesame chicken, onion pancake and of course, dumplings. Everything was great. It just seemed pricier than what we received but I think that's just the world we live in. Because of proximity, not sure if we would come again but if a group came we certainly would be back.

4 stars
I've been here years ago and it's still very good! We ordered the pork with chives pan fried dumplings(very tasty and crispy)! We saw that they had a lunch special with come with soup and spring roll! I had the sesame chicken (there were too much sauce but it was tasty), my husband had the Mongolian beef which had way too much sauce, the portion was huge, a lot more than my sesame chicken! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful! I would definitely go back and tried other entrees!

5 stars
Just revisited dumpling house again after being takeout only customers for the last year and had such an amazing experience! They have completely updated the space and it is so welcoming. 

We ordered a bunch of dumplings and buns for our table and they all came out steaming hot and flavorful. The Mapo Tofu was bursting with flavor and the perfect amount of mouth numbing spice! I have realized over the years that there is truly not one thing on this menu that isn't absolutely delicious from the orange chicken to the seasonal soup dumpling you can't go wrong! 

Not only was all the food delicious as always but the owner, Irene, and server were so attentive and kind to us during our visit. Even offering a free sample of the hot and sour soup which I HIGHLY recommend and will be ordering every visit from now on! Don't miss this hidden gem for take out or dine in with a large group because it is the best combination of affordable, well run and delicious!

2 stars
Always trying to support small businesses, we made a stop at Dumpling House. We tried a variety of things from the menu, which was all a bit lackluster. 

Beef pancakes: 3/5 lots of soup inside and crispy on the outside! Wish it was a little more flavorful but overall pretty decent

Beef rolls: 2/5 not bad! It could just use some more sauce and could be fried a little crispier

Braised beef noodle soup: 2/5 broth was too salty and lacked depth in flavor. Noodles were ok but nothing special. Would recommend skipping this and getting some other options on the menu 

Soup dumplings (pork): 2/5 decent filling and had a lot of soup inside! But not very rich in flavor and the wrappers were much too thick

String beans with minced pork: 5/5 easily the best dish we got! Hard to go wrong, and there was a lot of pork bits to add to the flavor!

House signature handmade bao: 3/5 these were definitely one of the better things on the menu! Felt homemade but not particularly memorable. 

Overall, somewhat decent food, and the staff was exceptionally kind! Maybe we just didn't order the right 
things!

5 stars
We have been looking for a great Chinese place to start frequenting and we have finally found our spot!! My husband said the fried dumpling was the BEST he's ever had. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (so crispy even with lots of sauce), and the chow mein was so flavorful! The staff were super nice and the hostess was a really sweetie!

1 stars
This looks like they had the same menu at one time as the Frisco location but it is pared down now. Soda is by the can with no free refills. 2025 is not starting out well for them. The heating doesn't work. They put a tiny space heater across from our table when we sat down. We were the only customers Friday at lunch-never a good sign. A lady was running an old wet rag across the tables, leaving everything sopping wet, then proceeded to put thin paper napkins on top of the wet table. We sat there for about 10 minutes trying to flag down someone to take our order. They saw us, we were the only people there, but just never came to take our order. We got up and left and they didn't seem surprised. This area of Plano used to be thriving, now it looks like a ghost town. Maybe if they get the heating fixed things will improve. I doubt I'll be back

1 stars
I really liked the dumplings here, but the customer service was really bad today. I ordered to-go on the phone and patiently waited as the lady asked me to hold several times. I didn't mind waiting since I understand it can get busy sometimes. So what happened was that they got my order wrong after I repeated my order and the lady repeated it back to me at least 5 times. The same lady called me back when my friend went to pick it up and asked if I ordered pork and cabbage when I clearly said pork and chives and she even repeated back my order correctly. The issue today was that she was extremely rude on the phone when she called back to confirm and even hung up on me when I told her that I ordered pork and chives. My friend that went to pick it up confirmed she hung up on me while shaking her head and looking really pissed.

5 stars
If you're craving dumplings, this place will satisfy that craving. They offer a lot of dumpling flavors (pork, chicken, veggie, fish, etc). We've tried a lot of different ones and they're all tasty. My go-to is still the classic pork dumpling. You can choose to get dumplings steamed or pan fried. Order a mix to try different kinds!

5 stars
We enjoyed every single thing that we ordered. Great quality food for a decent price. Service was great but we were told to sit anywhere when we entered but none of the tables seemed clean.

This place was pretty good, my favorite thing was the flat rice noodles with beef! The soup dumplings and wontons and spicy sauce had a spicy/sour taste to them which was different and not my preference. The service was pretty good considering it was close to their closing time.

Atmosphere wise this place is pretty separate and bland. Service is direct and to the point. Luckily, there English was decent enough that were both understood each other. 

Steamed buns here are pretty good. Great dough that has a pronounced yeast taste and smell as they probably make their own.

Fish dumplings are something I rarely see but they are pretty good here. Not amazing like when taught truffle or pork fat  are used but still tasty none the less. 

Custard buns sucked. They didn't have much filling and fell flat in flavor. Possibly the worst custard bun I've had. 

Scallion pancakes were even better than what you get at jeng chi! Maximum crispiness with plenty of oily goodness in each bite.

Yum! Under new management and it was wonderful. It's been a while but I was impressed by the food and the service. They remodeled a bit too and it felt much more comfortable and modern.

We have been coming here for years. And I mean like 5 years and I felt it necessary to come back and update my review after our last visit a few days ago. 
We will start with my beef noodle soup that I always get. The meat was nice and tender like always. The soup however, was nothing but a over salted beef broth. I am used to this being a very flavorful broth that bursts in your mouth with every single bite. Not the case anymore. I did read that there might be a new owner or cook and maybe that explains why the dish was changed. 
Secondly, my fianc√© always gets the same chicken and noodle dish and it's always so much food that we have to take some home. The portion was much smaller this time. 
Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone. The whole rush of the "hurry up and order, eat and get out" feeling was super real. I do not like that. We would have left by 9:30 without any of the rushing around us. 
I do appreciate that we are still able to bring our own wine in to enjoy with our meal. 
I just feel that every customer, from the first to the last, should be treated as if they are wanted in the establishment. It costs a lot of money to treat yourself these days by going out to eat.

The food is amazing, I've enjoyed it twice this week.  Go to place for me. The Orange Chicken is one of the best I have had.  Everything is fresh and tasty.

The food is amazing and wonderfully cooked! I love it so much I went twice in one week! Irene is the owner has been so awesome and even remembered my name. The Ambiance has been changed up and is awesome and more open now that the cocoon has been removed and has a more modern look.

As soon as you enter, you know if you are the target audience or not.

I was not the target audience for this establishment. The dishes are a bit pricey, the portions small, and look nothing like the pictures they have.

Beef roll looked like a skinny burrito.
Crispy pork were slivers of meat.
Dishes tasted like they came from premade packages.

There is more but as mentioned, not the target audience.

Food is excellent. Delicious, fresh me made and dare I say made with love?! It how it tastes. Quick and easy. Do yourself a favor just try it!

We came here on Sunday night. It was still early so there was no wait. We've been to the one in Frisco, but first time here at Plano location. 

There are good amount of seatings inside and family friendly ambiance. We had beef noodle soup, stir fry noodles, fried rice and beef wraps. Everything was so great and I feel like it's a lot better than the Frisco location. It's also less crowded!

1 stars
Not good for me. The flat beef noodles were dry and the beef was super tough.  The sauce was good. Also the noodles were stuck together and some were hard.

Placed order here and the restaurant waited an hour to cancel it. Attempted to reorder again and the restaurant waited another 45 minutes to cancel order with no reason once more. Don't waste your time with this one.

5 stars
This place is SOOO GOOD. Everything is perfect I got the dumplings, house signature bun (steamed) chicken fried rice and veggie lo mein. Everything is cooked to perfection ! The people in there took care of us and were super kind! I want to say we waited about 15-20 minutes but even just sitting inside felt so nostalgic ! The food is definitely authentic. Next time we'll stay to eat inside!

1 stars
Food and service are disgusting. Dumplings are undercooked and tasted terrible. Also we took to-go and the rest of our Oder was wrong. I called to tell them and they said you ordered what you got. Don't waist your money. The food we received had NO FLAVOR!

1 stars
Pretty disappointed. Heard great things. We ordered house buns(didn't care for), fried pork and scallion dumplings(very good), soup dumplings(pretty good, beef roll(enjoyed this), and combo fried rice. They gave us lo mein and we didn't notice until we got home. Called to get it corrected and the kid hung up on us. Service was meh from the get go. Sad because this place may be really good but the staff has a bad attitude and doesn't really care. They're just there for a check and could care less about the customers.

1 stars
First and last time!  I walked in to pick up a to go order, and stood at the register by the entrance for a solid 3 minutes in front of 2 employees. They finally said to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. I was asked "what I needed" as o said I'm here to pick up my order. I told him my name and he said what's your order number. I walked back out to the car to get my phone. I have them the order number he hands me my food. The whole exchange was weird and rude. The food sucked. The spicy pork was swimming in a pool of oil, the fried rice noodles with beef tasted like plastic, the orange chicken was chewy, and the egg rolls tasted off. I didn't even bother calling, as I didn't want to hear any excuses.

5 stars
We ordered several items and everything came out hot and fresh. The soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, steamed bun, and general tso chicken was some of the best we've had anywhere.

5 stars
Obsessed. Every time I hear of someone going to North Dallas (regardless of reason) I recommend this place while aggressively insisting they bring me home lots of steam buns. The actual restaurant is unassuming and staff is helpful. Driving 45 minutes across the metroplex for these cherished buns was worth every ounce of stained tshirt and steering wheel! The mini-trek was a birthday well spent and well fed!

5 stars
Every bite is so fresh and delicious in every dish we've ever tried here. Even the rice somehow tastes better than anywhere else. 
Seafood, veggies, spices, soup dumplings, fried and steamed dumplings, garlic pepper shrimp, everything was just so unbelievably tasty. 
This place is fail-proof! 
And the chocolate dumplings are worth the trip alone!

3 stars
I will see they have a ton of parking and the staff is very nice, but the food is kind of mid.

I got the soup dumplings and they were really good, but I don't think I've ever had soup dumplings that I don't like. With a decent amount of meat inside and the dumpling wrapper didn't fall apart so easily that I lost all soup in transit . I would totally get these again.

The big bummer was the DanDan noodles. They were way too vinegar tasting, and didn't have almost any other flavoring. I even left most of the meat because it was kind of flavorless.

5 stars
Really liked this place! I had the lunch special for $12.99 which included hot and sour soup (delicious!), an egg roll, and a choice of American-Chinese cuisine (I had orange chicken, there was general Tsao's, that sort of thing). However they also had xiao long bao, a variety of pan fried and steamed dumplings, and other authentic fare. I liked it so much I ended up ordering an entire meal for my family for later  I ordered traditional soup dumplings, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, chicken chow mein, took my leftovers (which was a lot!), and an order of their own design, chocolate soup dumplings! I have bamboo steam baskets at home so it was easy to reheat things. My family raved and my kids gobbled it up. 

I sat near the owner who was the absolute nicest - he is French and his partner/girlfriend is from Hong Kong. They just took it over 4 months ago and made some nice changes to the inside and menu changes as well. The kitchen staff is still the same. 

Go try it!!

3 stars
Very aesthetically pleasing, service was great and attentive, good location, I've been to several different dumping locations and unfortunately this is one of the ones that I didn't like. The soup dumplings were not good tasting, the walnut shrimp had too much mayonnaise and the shrimps were low quality, the cucumber salad had a ginger flavor instead of a garlic flavor but maybe that's they way it was supposed to be just not good in flavor. The green onion pancakes were delicious and the fried pork chive dumplings were good. 

Thanks for the experience.

4 stars
I thought Dumplings House was on par with my expectations. It is a smaller restaurant than I was expecting. Got the sesame chicken, onion pancake and of course, dumplings. Everything was great. It just seemed pricier than what we received but I think that's just the world we live in. Because of proximity, not sure if we would come again but if a group came we certainly would be back.

4 stars
I've been here years ago and it's still very good! We ordered the pork with chives pan fried dumplings(very tasty and crispy)! We saw that they had a lunch special with come with soup and spring roll! I had the sesame chicken (there were too much sauce but it was tasty), my husband had the Mongolian beef which had way too much sauce, the portion was huge, a lot more than my sesame chicken! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful! I would definitely go back and tried other entrees!

5 stars
Just revisited dumpling house again after being takeout only customers for the last year and had such an amazing experience! They have completely updated the space and it is so welcoming. 

We ordered a bunch of dumplings and buns for our table and they all came out steaming hot and flavorful. The Mapo Tofu was bursting with flavor and the perfect amount of mouth numbing spice! I have realized over the years that there is truly not one thing on this menu that isn't absolutely delicious from the orange chicken to the seasonal soup dumpling you can't go wrong! 

Not only was all the food delicious as always but the owner, Irene, and server were so attentive and kind to us during our visit. Even offering a free sample of the hot and sour soup which I HIGHLY recommend and will be ordering every visit from now on! Don't miss this hidden gem for take out or dine in with a large group because it is the best combination of affordable, well run and delicious!

2 stars
Always trying to support small businesses, we made a stop at Dumpling House. We tried a variety of things from the menu, which was all a bit lackluster. 

Beef pancakes: 3/5 lots of soup inside and crispy on the outside! Wish it was a little more flavorful but overall pretty decent

Beef rolls: 2/5 not bad! It could just use some more sauce and could be fried a little crispier

Braised beef noodle soup: 2/5 broth was too salty and lacked depth in flavor. Noodles were ok but nothing special. Would recommend skipping this and getting some other options on the menu 

Soup dumplings (pork): 2/5 decent filling and had a lot of soup inside! But not very rich in flavor and the wrappers were much too thick

String beans with minced pork: 5/5 easily the best dish we got! Hard to go wrong, and there was a lot of pork bits to add to the flavor!

House signature handmade bao: 3/5 these were definitely one of the better things on the menu! Felt homemade but not particularly memorable. 

Overall, somewhat decent food, and the staff was exceptionally kind! Maybe we just didn't order the right 
things!

5 stars
We have been looking for a great Chinese place to start frequenting and we have finally found our spot!! My husband said the fried dumpling was the BEST he's ever had. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (so crispy even with lots of sauce), and the chow mein was so flavorful! The staff were super nice and the hostess was a really sweetie!

1 stars
This looks like they had the same menu at one time as the Frisco location but it is pared down now. Soda is by the can with no free refills. 2025 is not starting out well for them. The heating doesn't work. They put a tiny space heater across from our table when we sat down. We were the only customers Friday at lunch-never a good sign. A lady was running an old wet rag across the tables, leaving everything sopping wet, then proceeded to put thin paper napkins on top of the wet table. We sat there for about 10 minutes trying to flag down someone to take our order. They saw us, we were the only people there, but just never came to take our order. We got up and left and they didn't seem surprised. This area of Plano used to be thriving, now it looks like a ghost town. Maybe if they get the heating fixed things will improve. I doubt I'll be back

1 stars
I really liked the dumplings here, but the customer service was really bad today. I ordered to-go on the phone and patiently waited as the lady asked me to hold several times. I didn't mind waiting since I understand it can get busy sometimes. So what happened was that they got my order wrong after I repeated my order and the lady repeated it back to me at least 5 times. The same lady called me back when my friend went to pick it up and asked if I ordered pork and cabbage when I clearly said pork and chives and she even repeated back my order correctly. The issue today was that she was extremely rude on the phone when she called back to confirm and even hung up on me when I told her that I ordered pork and chives. My friend that went to pick it up confirmed she hung up on me while shaking her head and looking really pissed.

5 stars
If you're craving dumplings, this place will satisfy that craving. They offer a lot of dumpling flavors (pork, chicken, veggie, fish, etc). We've tried a lot of different ones and they're all tasty. My go-to is still the classic pork dumpling. You can choose to get dumplings steamed or pan fried. Order a mix to try different kinds!

5 stars
We enjoyed every single thing that we ordered. Great quality food for a decent price. Service was great but we were told to sit anywhere when we entered but none of the tables seemed clean.

3 stars
This place was pretty good, my favorite thing was the flat rice noodles with beef! The soup dumplings and wontons and spicy sauce had a spicy/sour taste to them which was different and not my preference. The service was pretty good considering it was close to their closing time.

5 stars
This restaurant is a gem! My family and I have been there twice in two weeks, and this place is definitely now on our go-to list. So far we've tried the Orange Chicken, the Xaio Long Bao, the pork and the shrimp dumplings, the pork and chive dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, the crab rangoons, the green onion pancakes, the eggplant in garlic sauce (melt in your mouth!) the braised pork belly with cabbage (OMG....DELISH!), the sizzling beef, the innovative hot chocolate ganache dumplings and a few other dishes that I can't recall right now. 

Having been a chef in the food industry for many years, I notice things like how clean a place it....this place is impeccably clean with a lovely ambiance, and how professionally the food is prepared and served....this place has 5 stars in that category. The seasonings are just right, clean, fresh, neither under spiced nor over spiced. Absolutely perfect for the discerning palate. Last but not least, the owners and waitstaff are incredibly kind and accommodating, making sure that everyone has an excellent dining experience. The new owners have recently reopened and redecorated this restaurant, and revamped their menu to suit everyone's tastebuds. You must try the new Dumpling house on Parker Rd!

4 stars
I went to try this Chinese Dumpling House hidden inside a mini mall on West Parker Road, Plano TX.

I ordered Mongolian Beef from their lunch menu with white rice, hot and sour soup and egg roll included. The beef were thinly sliced and saut√©ed in onions and hosein sauce. It's delicious .

Serving Staff is friendly and helpful. The place is not fully lighted, kind a dark during lunchtime. But area is clean and well decorated. 

I will try handmade buns next time.

5 stars
The dumplings were truly amazing! The hostess was friendly and took the time to explain various food choices. She didn't push any upsells or direct me toward anything specific. The food was just as I had envisioned, especially the Mongolian beef, which looked exactly like the photo online. The beef and onion pancakes, pork and chive pan-fried dumplings, and beef short rib clay pot were all fantastic as well! I would definitely go back for more!

5 stars
Came for a light lunch on a weekend day to fuel up before we ran some errands before the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Began with the Green Onion Pancakes and Crab Rangoons. Both were excellent!! Really loved making a dipping sauce out of the Chili-Crisp and soy sauce. Both condiments readily available on your table; a nice touch!

Then we split the signature Soup Dumplings with ground pork and savory broth. We both had never had these before and were eager to try them! They were fantastic!!  Our glasses were kept full and waitstaff was attentive and the service was excellent. Costs were very appropriate for the amount of food. 

Definitely adding this to our restaurant rotation, as there's about a dozen other things on their menu I'm eager to try! I'm looking forward to trying their Pork and Chive Steamed buns, Crispy Spicy Chicken, and their dessert Chocolate Soup Dumplings sounds really intriguing!!  I didn't get any photos this time, but will do better next time.

5 stars
Everything was so good today but the new "Cheeseburger" Dumplings on the Seasonal Menu are unbelievable.  With a dab of Mustard, you will think it's a Cheeseburger.  And for dessert you must try the Chocolate Molten Boa Bun with walnuts.  Delish!!!!

4 stars
I think Dumpling House has changed ownership or just their name to Willow and Pine Dumpling House as of February 2024. We came for dinner, and I haven't been to this location in a few years, but the interior is revamped and looks more modern and inviting than it had before. Their dumplings and bao are still the stars of their menu. 

We got the boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork bao, both of which were delicious. The pork bao were very fluffy and soft, and while biting into the meat at first seemed somewhat bland, the more bites you took the more flavor seemed to come, and it was tastier the more you ate it. We also had the spicy garlic eggplant and a vegetable lo mein, which they said was vegetarian, not vegan, but we asked them to make the lo mein vegan for our friend to be able to eat and they were accomodating. These two dishes were okay, not amazing. The spicy garlic eggplant came with a small bowl of rice, and it could have been more generous. 

I do want to mention that the tableware we were given was a random mishmash; one person got a bowl and soup spoon that no one else got, three of us were given disposable chopsticks while one was given the resuable kind, and half the plates we were given were circular and half were oval-shaped. So they maybe need to work on attention to details in this aspect of restauranting! 

Also, the big menu with pictures was new and did not contain prices, and we had to ask for the prices of the dishes, which they handed to us on a longer paper menu. The dishes were still really good value, in my opinion.

The staff were nice and accommodating when we asked questions, and they came by to refill our waters pretty often. Overall, I think we had a pretty good experience, though it could be improved.

5 stars
Irene was so helpful on explaining their different types of dumplings. They were all fantastic!  Started with hot and sour soup. Arrived piping hot!   Yummy!!  Won ton soup was very tasty, the broth was full of flavor and the won tons were huge, very generous portions. The pork mdumplings we had fried and they disappeared immediately upon arrival. The steamed shrimp and pork dumplings  were generous too.  Such great fresh dishes.  We will be back!

5 stars
My husband and I decided to have dinner here Sunday night on a whim. This place is amazing. We ordered the scallion pancake, the beef roll, crab rangoons, soup dumplings, pork green beans and orange chicken. The food here tasted so authentic, the staff were super sweet and the food came out fast. My husband is usually a picky eater, and he loved the food. We live an hour away, but we definitely plan to make the trip to come back and eat here. This place is a hidden gem.

5 stars
Very good quiet little place. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all. The dumplings were delicious.  The service was great. We will go back.

Happy I found a place I like in Plano. The Lo Mein was flavorful and very garlicky (might not be everyone's cup of tea), but a tad salty. The dumplings were amazing! The dough wasn't too thick, the filling was delicious and juicing, and the pan fried crust was perfectly done. 

Service was fast and friendly and parking was easy to come by.

5 stars
The food was delicious and the service was friendly, I'd definitely go back! I took some to go orders as well, package perfect for the trip.

Tucked away in the back corner of this shopping center is a Chinese restaurant that blew away my expectations. I went there on a Thursday night and expected it to be a ghost town, but it was surprisingly filled. Not packed to where it would be unpleasant, but enough people to let me know something was up. And surely enough, after trying the food, I understood why so many people were there.

I started with the egg drop soup, which had a nice deep umami flavor to set the tone. Next I tried my standard meal to test a Chinese restaurant: orange chicken with fried rice. The rice was cooked well with nice garnish of egg and garlic, but the real start was the orange chicken. Every bite was succulent, and I could tell they put time into refining the recipe. The flavor profile was a lovely balance of the sweetness from the orange itself (the dish was garnished with real orange peels) and the heat from the chilis. It was the perfect amount of heat for me -- enough to add to the flavor profile but not so much it became overpowering. I finished my meal with what has got to be this place's piece de resistance: chocolate soup dumplings.

The chocolate soup dumplings are to die for. They are worth a two hour drive to get to this place. Given this place literally has dumpling in their name I had high hopes, and they exceeded them. The chocolate soup dumplings look like any other soup dumpling, but when you bite into them you are greeted with a rush of molten chocolate that is rich and creamy. These things are crack, I recommend getting one order per person!

Overall this restaurant blew my expectations away. The staff was also very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was the star. I plan on making this place one of my regular go-to's.

The place is authentic, no frills, and portion sizes were generous.

Parking is easy, and adjacent to the restaurant right out right.

I met up yet again with some girlfriends after work.  The Dumpling House has a wide variety of different types of dumplings.  We each ordered from the menu to share so I can't remember exactly each item ordered however it was all delicious, fresh and tasty...see pictures! 

Note:  They do not have alcohol that you can order however you can BYOB

I had the lunch special for $12.99 which included hot and sour soup (delicious!), an egg roll, and a choice of American-Chinese cuisine (I had orange chicken, there was general Tsao's, that sort of thing). However they also had xiao long bao, a variety of pan fried and steamed dumplings, and other authentic fare. I liked it so much I ended up ordering an entire meal for my family for later  I ordered traditional soup dumplings, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, chicken chow mein, took my leftovers (which was a lot!), and an order of their own design, chocolate soup dumplings! I have bamboo steam baskets at home so it was easy to reheat things. My family raved and my kids gobbled it up. 

I sat near the owner who was the absolute nicest - he is French and his partner/girlfriend is from Hong Kong. They just took it over 4 months ago and made some nice changes to the inside and menu changes as well. The kitchen staff is still the same. 

Go try it!!

Very aesthetically pleasing, service was great and attentive, good location, I've been to several different dumping locations and unfortunately this is one of the ones that I didn't like. The soup dumplings were not good tasting, the walnut shrimp had too much mayonnaise and the shrimps were low quality, the cucumber salad had a ginger flavor instead of a garlic flavor but maybe that's they way it was supposed to be just not good in flavor. The green onion pancakes were delicious and the fried pork chive dumplings were good. 

Thanks for the experience.

I thought Dumplings House was on par with my expectations. It is a smaller restaurant than I was expecting. Got the sesame chicken, onion pancake and of course, dumplings. Everything was great. It just seemed pricier than what we received but I think that's just the world we live in. Because of proximity, not sure if we would come again but if a group came we certainly would be back.

I've been here years ago and it's still very good! We ordered the pork with chives pan fried dumplings(very tasty and crispy)! We saw that they had a lunch special with come with soup and spring roll! I had the sesame chicken (there were too much sauce but it was tasty), my husband had the Mongolian beef which had way too much sauce, the portion was huge, a lot more than my sesame chicken! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful! I would definitely go back and tried other entrees!

5 stars
Just revisited dumpling house again after being takeout only customers for the last year and had such an amazing experience! They have completely updated the space and it is so welcoming. 

We ordered a bunch of dumplings and buns for our table and they all came out steaming hot and flavorful. The Mapo Tofu was bursting with flavor and the perfect amount of mouth numbing spice! I have realized over the years that there is truly not one thing on this menu that isn't absolutely delicious from the orange chicken to the seasonal soup dumpling you can't go wrong! 

Not only was all the food delicious as always but the owner, Irene, and server were so attentive and kind to us during our visit. Even offering a free sample of the hot and sour soup which I HIGHLY recommend and will be ordering every visit from now on! Don't miss this hidden gem for take out or dine in with a large group because it is the best combination of affordable, well run and delicious!

Always trying to support small businesses, we made a stop at Dumpling House. We tried a variety of things from the menu, which was all a bit lackluster. 

Beef pancakes: 3/5 lots of soup inside and crispy on the outside! Wish it was a little more flavorful but overall pretty decent

Beef rolls: 2/5 not bad! It could just use some more sauce and could be fried a little crispier

Braised beef noodle soup: 2/5 broth was too salty and lacked depth in flavor. Noodles were ok but nothing special. Would recommend skipping this and getting some other options on the menu 

Soup dumplings (pork): 2/5 decent filling and had a lot of soup inside! But not very rich in flavor and the wrappers were much too thick

String beans with minced pork: 5/5 easily the best dish we got! Hard to go wrong, and there was a lot of pork bits to add to the flavor!

House signature handmade bao: 3/5 these were definitely one of the better things on the menu! Felt homemade but not particularly memorable. 

Overall, somewhat decent food, and the staff was exceptionally kind! Maybe we just didn't order the right 
things!

5 stars
We have been looking for a great Chinese place to start frequenting and we have finally found our spot!! My husband said the fried dumpling was the BEST he's ever had. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (so crispy even with lots of sauce), and the chow mein was so flavorful! The staff were super nice and the hostess was a really sweetie!

This looks like they had the same menu at one time as the Frisco location but it is pared down now. Soda is by the can with no free refills. 2025 is not starting out well for them. The heating doesn't work. They put a tiny space heater across from our table when we sat down. We were the only customers Friday at lunch-never a good sign. A lady was running an old wet rag across the tables, leaving everything sopping wet, then proceeded to put thin paper napkins on top of the wet table. We sat there for about 10 minutes trying to flag down someone to take our order. They saw us, we were the only people there, but just never came to take our order. We got up and left and they didn't seem surprised. This area of Plano used to be thriving, now it looks like a ghost town. Maybe if they get the heating fixed things will improve. I doubt I'll be back

1 stars
I really liked the dumplings here, but the customer service was really bad today. I ordered to-go on the phone and patiently waited as the lady asked me to hold several times. I didn't mind waiting since I understand it can get busy sometimes. So what happened was that they got my order wrong after I repeated my order and the lady repeated it back to me at least 5 times. The same lady called me back when my friend went to pick it up and asked if I ordered pork and cabbage when I clearly said pork and chives and she even repeated back my order correctly. The issue today was that she was extremely rude on the phone when she called back to confirm and even hung up on me when I told her that I ordered pork and chives. My friend that went to pick it up confirmed she hung up on me while shaking her head and looking really pissed.

5 stars
If you're craving dumplings, this place will satisfy that craving. They offer a lot of dumpling flavors (pork, chicken, veggie, fish, etc). We've tried a lot of different ones and they're all tasty. My go-to is still the classic pork dumpling. You can choose to get dumplings steamed or pan fried. Order a mix to try different kinds!

5 stars
We enjoyed every single thing that we ordered. Great quality food for a decent price. Service was great but we were told to sit anywhere when we entered but none of the tables seemed clean.

3 stars
This place was pretty good, my favorite thing was the flat rice noodles with beef! The soup dumplings and wontons and spicy sauce had a spicy/sour taste to them which was different and not my preference. The service was pretty good considering it was close to their closing time.

5 stars
This restaurant is a gem! My family and I have been there twice in two weeks, and this place is definitely now on our go-to list. So far we've tried the Orange Chicken, the Xaio Long Bao, the pork and the shrimp dumplings, the pork and chive dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, the crab rangoons, the green onion pancakes, the eggplant in garlic sauce (melt in your mouth!) the braised pork belly with cabbage (OMG....DELISH!), the sizzling beef, the innovative hot chocolate ganache dumplings and a few other dishes that I can't recall right now. 

Having been a chef in the food industry for many years, I notice things like how clean a place it....this place is impeccably clean with a lovely ambiance, and how professionally the food is prepared and served....this place has 5 stars in that category. The seasonings are just right, clean, fresh, neither under spiced nor over spiced. Absolutely perfect for the discerning palate. Last but not least, the owners and waitstaff are incredibly kind and accommodating, making sure that everyone has an excellent dining experience. The new owners have recently reopened and redecorated this restaurant, and revamped their menu to suit everyone's tastebuds. You must try the new Dumpling house on Parker Rd!

4 stars
I went to try this Chinese Dumpling House hidden inside a mini mall on West Parker Road, Plano TX.

I ordered Mongolian Beef from their lunch menu with white rice, hot and sour soup and egg roll included. The beef were thinly sliced and saut√©ed in onions and hosein sauce. It's delicious .

Serving Staff is friendly and helpful. The place is not fully lighted, kind a dark during lunchtime. But area is clean and well decorated. 

I will try handmade buns next time.

5 stars
The dumplings were truly amazing! The hostess was friendly and took the time to explain various food choices. She didn't push any upsells or direct me toward anything specific. The food was just as I had envisioned, especially the Mongolian beef, which looked exactly like the photo online. The beef and onion pancakes, pork and chive pan-fried dumplings, and beef short rib clay pot were all fantastic as well! I would definitely go back for more!

5 stars
Came for a light lunch on a weekend day to fuel up before we ran some errands before the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Began with the Green Onion Pancakes and Crab Rangoons. Both were excellent!! Really loved making a dipping sauce out of the Chili-Crisp and soy sauce. Both condiments readily available on your table; a nice touch!

Then we split the signature Soup Dumplings with ground pork and savory broth. We both had never had these before and were eager to try them! They were fantastic!!  Our glasses were kept full and waitstaff was attentive and the service was excellent. Costs were very appropriate for the amount of food. 

Definitely adding this to our restaurant rotation, as there's about a dozen other things on their menu I'm eager to try! I'm looking forward to trying their Pork and Chive Steamed buns, Crispy Spicy Chicken, and their dessert Chocolate Soup Dumplings sounds really intriguing!!  I didn't get any photos this time, but will do better next time.

5 stars
Everything was so good today but the new "Cheeseburger" Dumplings on the Seasonal Menu are unbelievable.  With a dab of Mustard, you will think it's a Cheeseburger.  And for dessert you must try the Chocolate Molten Boa Bun with walnuts.  Delish!!!!

4 stars
I think Dumpling House has changed ownership or just their name to Willow and Pine Dumpling House as of February 2024. We came for dinner, and I haven't been to this location in a few years, but the interior is revamped and looks more modern and inviting than it had before. Their dumplings and bao are still the stars of their menu. 

We got the boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork bao, both of which were delicious. The pork bao were very fluffy and soft, and while biting into the meat at first seemed somewhat bland, the more bites you took the more flavor seemed to come, and it was tastier the more you ate it. We also had the spicy garlic eggplant and a vegetable lo mein, which they said was vegetarian, not vegan, but we asked them to make the lo mein vegan for our friend to be able to eat and they were accomodating. These two dishes were okay, not amazing. The spicy garlic eggplant came with a small bowl of rice, and it could have been more generous. 

I do want to mention that the tableware we were given was a random mishmash; one person got a bowl and soup spoon that no one else got, three of us were given disposable chopsticks while one was given the resuable kind, and half the plates we were given were circular and half were oval-shaped. So they maybe need to work on attention to details in this aspect of restauranting! 

Also, the big menu with pictures was new and did not contain prices, and we had to ask for the prices of the dishes, which they handed to us on a longer paper menu. The dishes were still really good value, in my opinion.

The staff were nice and accommodating when we asked questions, and they came by to refill our waters pretty often. Overall, I think we had a pretty good experience, though it could be improved.

5 stars
Irene was so helpful on explaining their different types of dumplings. They were all fantastic!  Started with hot and sour soup. Arrived piping hot!   Yummy!!  Won ton soup was very tasty, the broth was full of flavor and the won tons were huge, very generous portions. The pork mdumplings we had fried and they disappeared immediately upon arrival. The steamed shrimp and pork dumplings  were generous too.  Such great fresh dishes.  We will be back!

5 stars
My husband and I decided to have dinner here Sunday night on a whim. This place is amazing. We ordered the scallion pancake, the beef roll, crab rangoons, soup dumplings, pork green beans and orange chicken. The food here tasted so authentic, the staff were super sweet and the food came out fast. My husband is usually a picky eater, and he loved the food. We live an hour away, but we definitely plan to make the trip to come back and eat here. This place is a hidden gem.

5 stars
Very good quiet little place. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all. The dumplings were delicious.  The service was great. We will go back.

4 stars
Happy I found a place I like in Plano. The Lo Mein was flavorful and very garlicky (might not be everyone's cup of tea), but a tad salty. The dumplings were amazing! The dough wasn't too thick, the filling was delicious and juicing, and the pan fried crust was perfectly done. 

Service was fast and friendly and parking was easy to come by.

5 stars
The food was delicious and the service was friendly, I'd definitely go back! I took some to go orders as well, package perfect for the trip.

Tucked away in the back corner of this shopping center is a Chinese restaurant that blew away my expectations. I went there on a Thursday night and expected it to be a ghost town, but it was surprisingly filled. Not packed to where it would be unpleasant, but enough people to let me know something was up. And surely enough, after trying the food, I understood why so many people were there.

I started with the egg drop soup, which had a nice deep umami flavor to set the tone. Next I tried my standard meal to test a Chinese restaurant: orange chicken with fried rice. The rice was cooked well with nice garnish of egg and garlic, but the real start was the orange chicken. Every bite was succulent, and I could tell they put time into refining the recipe. The flavor profile was a lovely balance of the sweetness from the orange itself (the dish was garnished with real orange peels) and the heat from the chilis. It was the perfect amount of heat for me -- enough to add to the flavor profile but not so much it became overpowering. I finished my meal with what has got to be this place's piece de resistance: chocolate soup dumplings.

The chocolate soup dumplings are to die for. They are worth a two hour drive to get to this place. Given this place literally has dumpling in their name I had high hopes, and they exceeded them. The chocolate soup dumplings look like any other soup dumpling, but when you bite into them you are greeted with a rush of molten chocolate that is rich and creamy. These things are crack, I recommend getting one order per person!

Overall this restaurant blew my expectations away. The staff was also very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was the star. I plan on making this place one of my regular go-to's.

Had a wonderful meal at Dumpling House. The staff was very kind and the food was great! 

The place is authentic, no frills, and portion sizes were generous.

Parking is easy, and adjacent to the restaurant right out right.

I met up yet again with some girlfriends after work.  The Dumpling House has a wide variety of different types of dumplings.  We each ordered from the menu to share so I can't remember exactly each item ordered however it was all delicious, fresh and tasty...see pictures! 

Note:  They do not have alcohol that you can order however you can BYOB

4 stars
This place executes quite well what they advertise in their name. 

Atmosphere wise this place is pretty separate and bland. Service is direct and to the point. Luckily, there English was decent enough that were both understood each other. 

Steamed buns here are pretty good. Great dough that has a pronounced yeast taste and smell as they probably make their own.

Fish dumplings are something I rarely see but they are pretty good here. Not amazing like when taught truffle or pork fat  are used but still tasty none the less. 

Custard buns sucked. They didn't have much filling and fell flat in flavor. Possibly the worst custard bun I've had. 

Scallion pancakes were even better than what you get at jeng chi! Maximum crispiness with plenty of oily goodness in each bite.

5 stars
Yum! Under new management and it was wonderful. It's been a while but I was impressed by the food and the service. They remodeled a bit too and it felt much more comfortable and modern.

We have been coming here for years. And I mean like 5 years and I felt it necessary to come back and update my review after our last visit a few days ago. 
We will start with my beef noodle soup that I always get. The meat was nice and tender like always. The soup however, was nothing but a over salted beef broth. I am used to this being a very flavorful broth that bursts in your mouth with every single bite. Not the case anymore. I did read that there might be a new owner or cook and maybe that explains why the dish was changed. 
Secondly, my fianc√© always gets the same chicken and noodle dish and it's always so much food that we have to take some home. The portion was much smaller this time. 
Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone. The whole rush of the "hurry up and order, eat and get out" feeling was super real. I do not like that. We would have left by 9:30 without any of the rushing around us. 
I do appreciate that we are still able to bring our own wine in to enjoy with our meal. 
I just feel that every customer, from the first to the last, should be treated as if they are wanted in the establishment. It costs a lot of money to treat yourself these days by going out to eat.

The food is amazing and wonderfully cooked! I love it so much I went twice in one week! Irene is the owner has been so awesome and even remembered my name. The Ambiance has been changed up and is awesome and more open now that the cocoon has been removed and has a more modern look.

As soon as you enter, you know if you are the target audience or not.

I was not the target audience for this establishment. The dishes are a bit pricey, the portions small, and look nothing like the pictures they have.

Beef roll looked like a skinny burrito.
Crispy pork were slivers of meat.
Dishes tasted like they came from premade packages.

There is more but as mentioned, not the target audience.

Food is excellent. Delicious, fresh me made and dare I say made with love?! It how it tastes. Quick and easy. Do yourself a favor just try it!

We came here on Sunday night. It was still early so there was no wait. We've been to the one in Frisco, but first time here at Plano location. 

There are good amount of seatings inside and family friendly ambiance. We had beef noodle soup, stir fry noodles, fried rice and beef wraps. Everything was so great and I feel like it's a lot better than the Frisco location. It's also less crowded!

1 stars
Not good for me. The flat beef noodles were dry and the beef was super tough.  The sauce was good. Also the noodles were stuck together and some were hard.

Placed order here and the restaurant waited an hour to cancel it. Attempted to reorder again and the restaurant waited another 45 minutes to cancel order with no reason once more. Don't waste your time with this one.

This place is SOOO GOOD. Everything is perfect I got the dumplings, house signature bun (steamed) chicken fried rice and veggie lo mein. Everything is cooked to perfection ! The people in there took care of us and were super kind! I want to say we waited about 15-20 minutes but even just sitting inside felt so nostalgic ! The food is definitely authentic. Next time we'll stay to eat inside!

1 stars
Food and service are disgusting. Dumplings are undercooked and tasted terrible. Also we took to-go and the rest of our Oder was wrong. I called to tell them and they said you ordered what you got. Don't waist your money. The food we received had NO FLAVOR!

1 stars
Pretty disappointed. Heard great things. We ordered house buns(didn't care for), fried pork and scallion dumplings(very good), soup dumplings(pretty good, beef roll(enjoyed this), and combo fried rice. They gave us lo mein and we didn't notice until we got home. Called to get it corrected and the kid hung up on us. Service was meh from the get go. Sad because this place may be really good but the staff has a bad attitude and doesn't really care. They're just there for a check and could care less about the customers.

1 stars
First and last time!  I walked in to pick up a to go order, and stood at the register by the entrance for a solid 3 minutes in front of 2 employees. They finally said to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. I was asked "what I needed" as o said I'm here to pick up my order. I told him my name and he said what's your order number. I walked back out to the car to get my phone. I have them the order number he hands me my food. The whole exchange was weird and rude. The food sucked. The spicy pork was swimming in a pool of oil, the fried rice noodles with beef tasted like plastic, the orange chicken was chewy, and the egg rolls tasted off. I didn't even bother calling, as I didn't want to hear any excuses.

5 stars
We ordered several items and everything came out hot and fresh. The soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, steamed bun, and general tso chicken was some of the best we've had anywhere.

5 stars
Obsessed. Every time I hear of someone going to North Dallas (regardless of reason) I recommend this place while aggressively insisting they bring me home lots of steam buns. The actual restaurant is unassuming and staff is helpful. Driving 45 minutes across the metroplex for these cherished buns was worth every ounce of stained tshirt and steering wheel! The mini-trek was a birthday well spent and well fed!

5 stars
Every bite is so fresh and delicious in every dish we've ever tried here. Even the rice somehow tastes better than anywhere else. 
Seafood, veggies, spices, soup dumplings, fried and steamed dumplings, garlic pepper shrimp, everything was just so unbelievably tasty. 
This place is fail-proof! 
And the chocolate dumplings are worth the trip alone!

3 stars
I will see they have a ton of parking and the staff is very nice, but the food is kind of mid.

I got the soup dumplings and they were really good, but I don't think I've ever had soup dumplings that I don't like. With a decent amount of meat inside and the dumpling wrapper didn't fall apart so easily that I lost all soup in transit . I would totally get these again.

The big bummer was the DanDan noodles. They were way too vinegar tasting, and didn't have almost any other flavoring. I even left most of the meat because it was kind of flavorless.

The dumplings were truly amazing! The hostess was friendly and took the time to explain various food choices. She didn't push any upsells or direct me toward anything specific. The food was just as I had envisioned, especially the Mongolian beef, which looked exactly like the photo online. The beef and onion pancakes, pork and chive pan-fried dumplings, and beef short rib clay pot were all fantastic as well! I would definitely go back for more!

Came for a light lunch on a weekend day to fuel up before we ran some errands before the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Began with the Green Onion Pancakes and Crab Rangoons. Both were excellent!! Really loved making a dipping sauce out of the Chili-Crisp and soy sauce. Both condiments readily available on your table; a nice touch!

Then we split the signature Soup Dumplings with ground pork and savory broth. We both had never had these before and were eager to try them! They were fantastic!!  Our glasses were kept full and waitstaff was attentive and the service was excellent. Costs were very appropriate for the amount of food. 

Definitely adding this to our restaurant rotation, as there's about a dozen other things on their menu I'm eager to try! I'm looking forward to trying their Pork and Chive Steamed buns, Crispy Spicy Chicken, and their dessert Chocolate Soup Dumplings sounds really intriguing!!  I didn't get any photos this time, but will do better next time.

5 stars
Everything was so good today but the new "Cheeseburger" Dumplings on the Seasonal Menu are unbelievable.  With a dab of Mustard, you will think it's a Cheeseburger.  And for dessert you must try the Chocolate Molten Boa Bun with walnuts.  Delish!!!!

I think Dumpling House has changed ownership or just their name to Willow and Pine Dumpling House as of February 2024. We came for dinner, and I haven't been to this location in a few years, but the interior is revamped and looks more modern and inviting than it had before. Their dumplings and bao are still the stars of their menu. 

We got the boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork bao, both of which were delicious. The pork bao were very fluffy and soft, and while biting into the meat at first seemed somewhat bland, the more bites you took the more flavor seemed to come, and it was tastier the more you ate it. We also had the spicy garlic eggplant and a vegetable lo mein, which they said was vegetarian, not vegan, but we asked them to make the lo mein vegan for our friend to be able to eat and they were accomodating. These two dishes were okay, not amazing. The spicy garlic eggplant came with a small bowl of rice, and it could have been more generous. 

I do want to mention that the tableware we were given was a random mishmash; one person got a bowl and soup spoon that no one else got, three of us were given disposable chopsticks while one was given the resuable kind, and half the plates we were given were circular and half were oval-shaped. So they maybe need to work on attention to details in this aspect of restauranting! 

Also, the big menu with pictures was new and did not contain prices, and we had to ask for the prices of the dishes, which they handed to us on a longer paper menu. The dishes were still really good value, in my opinion.

The staff were nice and accommodating when we asked questions, and they came by to refill our waters pretty often. Overall, I think we had a pretty good experience, though it could be improved.

Irene was so helpful on explaining their different types of dumplings. They were all fantastic!  Started with hot and sour soup. Arrived piping hot!   Yummy!!  Won ton soup was very tasty, the broth was full of flavor and the won tons were huge, very generous portions. The pork mdumplings we had fried and they disappeared immediately upon arrival. The steamed shrimp and pork dumplings  were generous too.  Such great fresh dishes.  We will be back!

My husband and I decided to have dinner here Sunday night on a whim. This place is amazing. We ordered the scallion pancake, the beef roll, crab rangoons, soup dumplings, pork green beans and orange chicken. The food here tasted so authentic, the staff were super sweet and the food came out fast. My husband is usually a picky eater, and he loved the food. We live an hour away, but we definitely plan to make the trip to come back and eat here. This place is a hidden gem.

5 stars
Very good quiet little place. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all. The dumplings were delicious.  The service was great. We will go back.

Happy I found a place I like in Plano. The Lo Mein was flavorful and very garlicky (might not be everyone's cup of tea), but a tad salty. The dumplings were amazing! The dough wasn't too thick, the filling was delicious and juicing, and the pan fried crust was perfectly done. 

Service was fast and friendly and parking was easy to come by.

The food was delicious and the service was friendly, I'd definitely go back! I took some to go orders as well, package perfect for the trip.

Tucked away in the back corner of this shopping center is a Chinese restaurant that blew away my expectations. I went there on a Thursday night and expected it to be a ghost town, but it was surprisingly filled. Not packed to where it would be unpleasant, but enough people to let me know something was up. And surely enough, after trying the food, I understood why so many people were there.

I started with the egg drop soup, which had a nice deep umami flavor to set the tone. Next I tried my standard meal to test a Chinese restaurant: orange chicken with fried rice. The rice was cooked well with nice garnish of egg and garlic, but the real start was the orange chicken. Every bite was succulent, and I could tell they put time into refining the recipe. The flavor profile was a lovely balance of the sweetness from the orange itself (the dish was garnished with real orange peels) and the heat from the chilis. It was the perfect amount of heat for me -- enough to add to the flavor profile but not so much it became overpowering. I finished my meal with what has got to be this place's piece de resistance: chocolate soup dumplings.

The chocolate soup dumplings are to die for. They are worth a two hour drive to get to this place. Given this place literally has dumpling in their name I had high hopes, and they exceeded them. The chocolate soup dumplings look like any other soup dumpling, but when you bite into them you are greeted with a rush of molten chocolate that is rich and creamy. These things are crack, I recommend getting one order per person!

Overall this restaurant blew my expectations away. The staff was also very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was the star. I plan on making this place one of my regular go-to's.

Had a wonderful meal at Dumpling House. The staff was very kind and the food was great! 

The place is authentic, no frills, and portion sizes were generous.

Parking is easy, and adjacent to the restaurant right out right.

I met up yet again with some girlfriends after work.  The Dumpling House has a wide variety of different types of dumplings.  We each ordered from the menu to share so I can't remember exactly each item ordered however it was all delicious, fresh and tasty...see pictures! 

Note:  They do not have alcohol that you can order however you can BYOB

4 stars
This place executes quite well what they advertise in their name. 

Atmosphere wise this place is pretty separate and bland. Service is direct and to the point. Luckily, there English was decent enough that were both understood each other. 

Steamed buns here are pretty good. Great dough that has a pronounced yeast taste and smell as they probably make their own.

Fish dumplings are something I rarely see but they are pretty good here. Not amazing like when taught truffle or pork fat  are used but still tasty none the less. 

Custard buns sucked. They didn't have much filling and fell flat in flavor. Possibly the worst custard bun I've had. 

Scallion pancakes were even better than what you get at jeng chi! Maximum crispiness with plenty of oily goodness in each bite.

5 stars
Yum! Under new management and it was wonderful. It's been a while but I was impressed by the food and the service. They remodeled a bit too and it felt much more comfortable and modern.

We have been coming here for years. And I mean like 5 years and I felt it necessary to come back and update my review after our last visit a few days ago. 
We will start with my beef noodle soup that I always get. The meat was nice and tender like always. The soup however, was nothing but a over salted beef broth. I am used to this being a very flavorful broth that bursts in your mouth with every single bite. Not the case anymore. I did read that there might be a new owner or cook and maybe that explains why the dish was changed. 
Secondly, my fianc√© always gets the same chicken and noodle dish and it's always so much food that we have to take some home. The portion was much smaller this time. 
Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone. The whole rush of the "hurry up and order, eat and get out" feeling was super real. I do not like that. We would have left by 9:30 without any of the rushing around us. 
I do appreciate that we are still able to bring our own wine in to enjoy with our meal. 
I just feel that every customer, from the first to the last, should be treated as if they are wanted in the establishment. It costs a lot of money to treat yourself these days by going out to eat.

5 stars
My first visit to the Dumpling House in Plano, and the food is terrific!  Service was quick as well and it made for a delicious lunch.

5 stars
The food is amazing, I've enjoyed it twice this week.  Go to place for me. The Orange Chicken is one of the best I have had.  Everything is fresh and tasty.

5 stars
The food is amazing and wonderfully cooked! I love it so much I went twice in one week! Irene is the owner has been so awesome and even remembered my name. The Ambiance has been changed up and is awesome and more open now that the cocoon has been removed and has a more modern look.

1 stars
As soon as you enter, you know if you are the target audience or not.

I was not the target audience for this establishment. The dishes are a bit pricey, the portions small, and look nothing like the pictures they have.

Beef roll looked like a skinny burrito.
Crispy pork were slivers of meat.
Dishes tasted like they came from premade packages.

There is more but as mentioned, not the target audience.

5 stars
Food is excellent. Delicious, fresh me made and dare I say made with love?! It how it tastes. Quick and easy. Do yourself a favor just try it!

I stumbled upon this gem some years back. I have always loved their food and had to come back after a few years of being away. We ordered the fried pork and scallion dumplings, and curry noodles were delicious!

The Jalape√±o cilantro rice and combination fried rice is so good! Great service. We will be coming again :)

Poor service. Our server seemed very agitated to get us water, napkins, and straws. The soup dumplings had a sour aftertaste.. not very good compared to others i've had.

5 stars
Very kind customer service and the food here is delicious would recommend trying thus place out if you haven't yet

5 stars
We came here on Sunday night. It was still early so there was no wait. We've been to the one in Frisco, but first time here at Plano location. 

There are good amount of seatings inside and family friendly ambiance. We had beef noodle soup, stir fry noodles, fried rice and beef wraps. Everything was so great and I feel like it's a lot better than the Frisco location. It's also less crowded!

1 stars
Not good for me. The flat beef noodles were dry and the beef was super tough.  The sauce was good. Also the noodles were stuck together and some were hard.

1 stars
Placed order here and the restaurant waited an hour to cancel it. Attempted to reorder again and the restaurant waited another 45 minutes to cancel order with no reason once more. Don't waste your time with this one.

5 stars
This place is SOOO GOOD. Everything is perfect I got the dumplings, house signature bun (steamed) chicken fried rice and veggie lo mein. Everything is cooked to perfection ! The people in there took care of us and were super kind! I want to say we waited about 15-20 minutes but even just sitting inside felt so nostalgic ! The food is definitely authentic. Next time we'll stay to eat inside!

1 stars
Food and service are disgusting. Dumplings are undercooked and tasted terrible. Also we took to-go and the rest of our Oder was wrong. I called to tell them and they said you ordered what you got. Don't waist your money. The food we received had NO FLAVOR!

1 stars
Pretty disappointed. Heard great things. We ordered house buns(didn't care for), fried pork and scallion dumplings(very good), soup dumplings(pretty good, beef roll(enjoyed this), and combo fried rice. They gave us lo mein and we didn't notice until we got home. Called to get it corrected and the kid hung up on us. Service was meh from the get go. Sad because this place may be really good but the staff has a bad attitude and doesn't really care. They're just there for a check and could care less about the customers.

1 stars
First and last time!  I walked in to pick up a to go order, and stood at the register by the entrance for a solid 3 minutes in front of 2 employees. They finally said to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. I was asked "what I needed" as o said I'm here to pick up my order. I told him my name and he said what's your order number. I walked back out to the car to get my phone. I have them the order number he hands me my food. The whole exchange was weird and rude. The food sucked. The spicy pork was swimming in a pool of oil, the fried rice noodles with beef tasted like plastic, the orange chicken was chewy, and the egg rolls tasted off. I didn't even bother calling, as I didn't want to hear any excuses.

5 stars
We ordered several items and everything came out hot and fresh. The soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, steamed bun, and general tso chicken was some of the best we've had anywhere.

5 stars
Obsessed. Every time I hear of someone going to North Dallas (regardless of reason) I recommend this place while aggressively insisting they bring me home lots of steam buns. The actual restaurant is unassuming and staff is helpful. Driving 45 minutes across the metroplex for these cherished buns was worth every ounce of stained tshirt and steering wheel! The mini-trek was a birthday well spent and well fed!

5 stars
Every bite is so fresh and delicious in every dish we've ever tried here. Even the rice somehow tastes better than anywhere else. 
Seafood, veggies, spices, soup dumplings, fried and steamed dumplings, garlic pepper shrimp, everything was just so unbelievably tasty. 
This place is fail-proof! 
And the chocolate dumplings are worth the trip alone!

3 stars
I will see they have a ton of parking and the staff is very nice, but the food is kind of mid.

I got the soup dumplings and they were really good, but I don't think I've ever had soup dumplings that I don't like. With a decent amount of meat inside and the dumpling wrapper didn't fall apart so easily that I lost all soup in transit . I would totally get these again.

The big bummer was the DanDan noodles. They were way too vinegar tasting, and didn't have almost any other flavoring. I even left most of the meat because it was kind of flavorless.

5 stars
Really liked this place! I had the lunch special for $12.99 which included hot and sour soup (delicious!), an egg roll, and a choice of American-Chinese cuisine (I had orange chicken, there was general Tsao's, that sort of thing). However they also had xiao long bao, a variety of pan fried and steamed dumplings, and other authentic fare. I liked it so much I ended up ordering an entire meal for my family for later  I ordered traditional soup dumplings, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, chicken chow mein, took my leftovers (which was a lot!), and an order of their own design, chocolate soup dumplings! I have bamboo steam baskets at home so it was easy to reheat things. My family raved and my kids gobbled it up. 

I sat near the owner who was the absolute nicest - he is French and his partner/girlfriend is from Hong Kong. They just took it over 4 months ago and made some nice changes to the inside and menu changes as well. The kitchen staff is still the same. 

Go try it!!

3 stars
Very aesthetically pleasing, service was great and attentive, good location, I've been to several different dumping locations and unfortunately this is one of the ones that I didn't like. The soup dumplings were not good tasting, the walnut shrimp had too much mayonnaise and the shrimps were low quality, the cucumber salad had a ginger flavor instead of a garlic flavor but maybe that's they way it was supposed to be just not good in flavor. The green onion pancakes were delicious and the fried pork chive dumplings were good. 

Thanks for the experience.

4 stars
I thought Dumplings House was on par with my expectations. It is a smaller restaurant than I was expecting. Got the sesame chicken, onion pancake and of course, dumplings. Everything was great. It just seemed pricier than what we received but I think that's just the world we live in. Because of proximity, not sure if we would come again but if a group came we certainly would be back.

4 stars
I've been here years ago and it's still very good! We ordered the pork with chives pan fried dumplings(very tasty and crispy)! We saw that they had a lunch special with come with soup and spring roll! I had the sesame chicken (there were too much sauce but it was tasty), my husband had the Mongolian beef which had way too much sauce, the portion was huge, a lot more than my sesame chicken! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful! I would definitely go back and tried other entrees!

5 stars
Just revisited dumpling house again after being takeout only customers for the last year and had such an amazing experience! They have completely updated the space and it is so welcoming. 

We ordered a bunch of dumplings and buns for our table and they all came out steaming hot and flavorful. The Mapo Tofu was bursting with flavor and the perfect amount of mouth numbing spice! I have realized over the years that there is truly not one thing on this menu that isn't absolutely delicious from the orange chicken to the seasonal soup dumpling you can't go wrong! 

Not only was all the food delicious as always but the owner, Irene, and server were so attentive and kind to us during our visit. Even offering a free sample of the hot and sour soup which I HIGHLY recommend and will be ordering every visit from now on! Don't miss this hidden gem for take out or dine in with a large group because it is the best combination of affordable, well run and delicious!

2 stars
Always trying to support small businesses, we made a stop at Dumpling House. We tried a variety of things from the menu, which was all a bit lackluster. 

Beef pancakes: 3/5 lots of soup inside and crispy on the outside! Wish it was a little more flavorful but overall pretty decent

Beef rolls: 2/5 not bad! It could just use some more sauce and could be fried a little crispier

Braised beef noodle soup: 2/5 broth was too salty and lacked depth in flavor. Noodles were ok but nothing special. Would recommend skipping this and getting some other options on the menu 

Soup dumplings (pork): 2/5 decent filling and had a lot of soup inside! But not very rich in flavor and the wrappers were much too thick

String beans with minced pork: 5/5 easily the best dish we got! Hard to go wrong, and there was a lot of pork bits to add to the flavor!

House signature handmade bao: 3/5 these were definitely one of the better things on the menu! Felt homemade but not particularly memorable. 

Overall, somewhat decent food, and the staff was exceptionally kind! Maybe we just didn't order the right 
things!

5 stars
We have been looking for a great Chinese place to start frequenting and we have finally found our spot!! My husband said the fried dumpling was the BEST he's ever had. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (so crispy even with lots of sauce), and the chow mein was so flavorful! The staff were super nice and the hostess was a really sweetie!

1 stars
This looks like they had the same menu at one time as the Frisco location but it is pared down now. Soda is by the can with no free refills. 2025 is not starting out well for them. The heating doesn't work. They put a tiny space heater across from our table when we sat down. We were the only customers Friday at lunch-never a good sign. A lady was running an old wet rag across the tables, leaving everything sopping wet, then proceeded to put thin paper napkins on top of the wet table. We sat there for about 10 minutes trying to flag down someone to take our order. They saw us, we were the only people there, but just never came to take our order. We got up and left and they didn't seem surprised. This area of Plano used to be thriving, now it looks like a ghost town. Maybe if they get the heating fixed things will improve. I doubt I'll be back

1 stars
I really liked the dumplings here, but the customer service was really bad today. I ordered to-go on the phone and patiently waited as the lady asked me to hold several times. I didn't mind waiting since I understand it can get busy sometimes. So what happened was that they got my order wrong after I repeated my order and the lady repeated it back to me at least 5 times. The same lady called me back when my friend went to pick it up and asked if I ordered pork and cabbage when I clearly said pork and chives and she even repeated back my order correctly. The issue today was that she was extremely rude on the phone when she called back to confirm and even hung up on me when I told her that I ordered pork and chives. My friend that went to pick it up confirmed she hung up on me while shaking her head and looking really pissed.

5 stars
If you're craving dumplings, this place will satisfy that craving. They offer a lot of dumpling flavors (pork, chicken, veggie, fish, etc). We've tried a lot of different ones and they're all tasty. My go-to is still the classic pork dumpling. You can choose to get dumplings steamed or pan fried. Order a mix to try different kinds!

5 stars
We enjoyed every single thing that we ordered. Great quality food for a decent price. Service was great but we were told to sit anywhere when we entered but none of the tables seemed clean.

3 stars
This place was pretty good, my favorite thing was the flat rice noodles with beef! The soup dumplings and wontons and spicy sauce had a spicy/sour taste to them which was different and not my preference. The service was pretty good considering it was close to their closing time.

5 stars
This restaurant is a gem! My family and I have been there twice in two weeks, and this place is definitely now on our go-to list. So far we've tried the Orange Chicken, the Xaio Long Bao, the pork and the shrimp dumplings, the pork and chive dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, the crab rangoons, the green onion pancakes, the eggplant in garlic sauce (melt in your mouth!) the braised pork belly with cabbage (OMG....DELISH!), the sizzling beef, the innovative hot chocolate ganache dumplings and a few other dishes that I can't recall right now. 

Having been a chef in the food industry for many years, I notice things like how clean a place it....this place is impeccably clean with a lovely ambiance, and how professionally the food is prepared and served....this place has 5 stars in that category. The seasonings are just right, clean, fresh, neither under spiced nor over spiced. Absolutely perfect for the discerning palate. Last but not least, the owners and waitstaff are incredibly kind and accommodating, making sure that everyone has an excellent dining experience. The new owners have recently reopened and redecorated this restaurant, and revamped their menu to suit everyone's tastebuds. You must try the new Dumpling house on Parker Rd!

4 stars
I went to try this Chinese Dumpling House hidden inside a mini mall on West Parker Road, Plano TX.

I ordered Mongolian Beef from their lunch menu with white rice, hot and sour soup and egg roll included. The beef were thinly sliced and saut√©ed in onions and hosein sauce. It's delicious .

Serving Staff is friendly and helpful. The place is not fully lighted, kind a dark during lunchtime. But area is clean and well decorated. 

I will try handmade buns next time.

Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone. The whole rush of the "hurry up and order, eat and get out" feeling was super real. I do not like that. We would have left by 9:30 without any of the rushing around us. 
I do appreciate that we are still able to bring our own wine in to enjoy with our meal. 
I just feel that every customer, from the first to the last, should be treated as if they are wanted in the establishment. It costs a lot of money to treat yourself these days by going out to eat.

My first visit to the Dumpling House in Plano, and the food is terrific!  Service was quick as well and it made for a delicious lunch.

The food is amazing, I've enjoyed it twice this week.  Go to place for me. The Orange Chicken is one of the best I have had.  Everything is fresh and tasty.

The food is amazing and wonderfully cooked! I love it so much I went twice in one week! Irene is the owner has been so awesome and even remembered my name. The Ambiance has been changed up and is awesome and more open now that the cocoon has been removed and has a more modern look.

As soon as you enter, you know if you are the target audience or not.

I was not the target audience for this establishment. The dishes are a bit pricey, the portions small, and look nothing like the pictures they have.

Beef roll looked like a skinny burrito.
Crispy pork were slivers of meat.
Dishes tasted like they came from premade packages.

There is more but as mentioned, not the target audience.

Food is excellent. Delicious, fresh me made and dare I say made with love?! It how it tastes. Quick and easy. Do yourself a favor just try it!

I stumbled upon this gem some years back. I have always loved their food and had to come back after a few years of being away. We ordered the fried pork and scallion dumplings, and curry noodles were delicious!

We came here on Sunday night. It was still early so there was no wait. We've been to the one in Frisco, but first time here at Plano location. 

There are good amount of seatings inside and family friendly ambiance. We had beef noodle soup, stir fry noodles, fried rice and beef wraps. Everything was so great and I feel like it's a lot better than the Frisco location. It's also less crowded!

1 stars
Not good for me. The flat beef noodles were dry and the beef was super tough.  The sauce was good. Also the noodles were stuck together and some were hard.

Placed order here and the restaurant waited an hour to cancel it. Attempted to reorder again and the restaurant waited another 45 minutes to cancel order with no reason once more. Don't waste your time with this one.

This place is SOOO GOOD. Everything is perfect I got the dumplings, house signature bun (steamed) chicken fried rice and veggie lo mein. Everything is cooked to perfection ! The people in there took care of us and were super kind! I want to say we waited about 15-20 minutes but even just sitting inside felt so nostalgic ! The food is definitely authentic. Next time we'll stay to eat inside!

Food and service are disgusting. Dumplings are undercooked and tasted terrible. Also we took to-go and the rest of our Oder was wrong. I called to tell them and they said you ordered what you got. Don't waist your money. The food we received had NO FLAVOR!

1 stars
Pretty disappointed. Heard great things. We ordered house buns(didn't care for), fried pork and scallion dumplings(very good), soup dumplings(pretty good, beef roll(enjoyed this), and combo fried rice. They gave us lo mein and we didn't notice until we got home. Called to get it corrected and the kid hung up on us. Service was meh from the get go. Sad because this place may be really good but the staff has a bad attitude and doesn't really care. They're just there for a check and could care less about the customers.

First and last time!  I walked in to pick up a to go order, and stood at the register by the entrance for a solid 3 minutes in front of 2 employees. They finally said to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. I was asked "what I needed" as o said I'm here to pick up my order. I told him my name and he said what's your order number. I walked back out to the car to get my phone. I have them the order number he hands me my food. The whole exchange was weird and rude. The food sucked. The spicy pork was swimming in a pool of oil, the fried rice noodles with beef tasted like plastic, the orange chicken was chewy, and the egg rolls tasted off. I didn't even bother calling, as I didn't want to hear any excuses.

5 stars
We ordered several items and everything came out hot and fresh. The soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, steamed bun, and general tso chicken was some of the best we've had anywhere.

5 stars
Obsessed. Every time I hear of someone going to North Dallas (regardless of reason) I recommend this place while aggressively insisting they bring me home lots of steam buns. The actual restaurant is unassuming and staff is helpful. Driving 45 minutes across the metroplex for these cherished buns was worth every ounce of stained tshirt and steering wheel! The mini-trek was a birthday well spent and well fed!

5 stars
Every bite is so fresh and delicious in every dish we've ever tried here. Even the rice somehow tastes better than anywhere else. 
Seafood, veggies, spices, soup dumplings, fried and steamed dumplings, garlic pepper shrimp, everything was just so unbelievably tasty. 
This place is fail-proof! 
And the chocolate dumplings are worth the trip alone!

3 stars
I will see they have a ton of parking and the staff is very nice, but the food is kind of mid.

I got the soup dumplings and they were really good, but I don't think I've ever had soup dumplings that I don't like. With a decent amount of meat inside and the dumpling wrapper didn't fall apart so easily that I lost all soup in transit . I would totally get these again.

The big bummer was the DanDan noodles. They were way too vinegar tasting, and didn't have almost any other flavoring. I even left most of the meat because it was kind of flavorless.

5 stars
Really liked this place! I had the lunch special for $12.99 which included hot and sour soup (delicious!), an egg roll, and a choice of American-Chinese cuisine (I had orange chicken, there was general Tsao's, that sort of thing). However they also had xiao long bao, a variety of pan fried and steamed dumplings, and other authentic fare. I liked it so much I ended up ordering an entire meal for my family for later  I ordered traditional soup dumplings, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, chicken chow mein, took my leftovers (which was a lot!), and an order of their own design, chocolate soup dumplings! I have bamboo steam baskets at home so it was easy to reheat things. My family raved and my kids gobbled it up. 

I sat near the owner who was the absolute nicest - he is French and his partner/girlfriend is from Hong Kong. They just took it over 4 months ago and made some nice changes to the inside and menu changes as well. The kitchen staff is still the same. 

Go try it!!

3 stars
Very aesthetically pleasing, service was great and attentive, good location, I've been to several different dumping locations and unfortunately this is one of the ones that I didn't like. The soup dumplings were not good tasting, the walnut shrimp had too much mayonnaise and the shrimps were low quality, the cucumber salad had a ginger flavor instead of a garlic flavor but maybe that's they way it was supposed to be just not good in flavor. The green onion pancakes were delicious and the fried pork chive dumplings were good. 

Thanks for the experience.

4 stars
I thought Dumplings House was on par with my expectations. It is a smaller restaurant than I was expecting. Got the sesame chicken, onion pancake and of course, dumplings. Everything was great. It just seemed pricier than what we received but I think that's just the world we live in. Because of proximity, not sure if we would come again but if a group came we certainly would be back.

4 stars
I've been here years ago and it's still very good! We ordered the pork with chives pan fried dumplings(very tasty and crispy)! We saw that they had a lunch special with come with soup and spring roll! I had the sesame chicken (there were too much sauce but it was tasty), my husband had the Mongolian beef which had way too much sauce, the portion was huge, a lot more than my sesame chicken! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful! I would definitely go back and tried other entrees!

5 stars
Just revisited dumpling house again after being takeout only customers for the last year and had such an amazing experience! They have completely updated the space and it is so welcoming. 

We ordered a bunch of dumplings and buns for our table and they all came out steaming hot and flavorful. The Mapo Tofu was bursting with flavor and the perfect amount of mouth numbing spice! I have realized over the years that there is truly not one thing on this menu that isn't absolutely delicious from the orange chicken to the seasonal soup dumpling you can't go wrong! 

Not only was all the food delicious as always but the owner, Irene, and server were so attentive and kind to us during our visit. Even offering a free sample of the hot and sour soup which I HIGHLY recommend and will be ordering every visit from now on! Don't miss this hidden gem for take out or dine in with a large group because it is the best combination of affordable, well run and delicious!

2 stars
Always trying to support small businesses, we made a stop at Dumpling House. We tried a variety of things from the menu, which was all a bit lackluster. 

Beef pancakes: 3/5 lots of soup inside and crispy on the outside! Wish it was a little more flavorful but overall pretty decent

Beef rolls: 2/5 not bad! It could just use some more sauce and could be fried a little crispier

Braised beef noodle soup: 2/5 broth was too salty and lacked depth in flavor. Noodles were ok but nothing special. Would recommend skipping this and getting some other options on the menu 

Soup dumplings (pork): 2/5 decent filling and had a lot of soup inside! But not very rich in flavor and the wrappers were much too thick

String beans with minced pork: 5/5 easily the best dish we got! Hard to go wrong, and there was a lot of pork bits to add to the flavor!

House signature handmade bao: 3/5 these were definitely one of the better things on the menu! Felt homemade but not particularly memorable. 

Overall, somewhat decent food, and the staff was exceptionally kind! Maybe we just didn't order the right 
things!

5 stars
We have been looking for a great Chinese place to start frequenting and we have finally found our spot!! My husband said the fried dumpling was the BEST he's ever had. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (so crispy even with lots of sauce), and the chow mein was so flavorful! The staff were super nice and the hostess was a really sweetie!

1 stars
This looks like they had the same menu at one time as the Frisco location but it is pared down now. Soda is by the can with no free refills. 2025 is not starting out well for them. The heating doesn't work. They put a tiny space heater across from our table when we sat down. We were the only customers Friday at lunch-never a good sign. A lady was running an old wet rag across the tables, leaving everything sopping wet, then proceeded to put thin paper napkins on top of the wet table. We sat there for about 10 minutes trying to flag down someone to take our order. They saw us, we were the only people there, but just never came to take our order. We got up and left and they didn't seem surprised. This area of Plano used to be thriving, now it looks like a ghost town. Maybe if they get the heating fixed things will improve. I doubt I'll be back

1 stars
I really liked the dumplings here, but the customer service was really bad today. I ordered to-go on the phone and patiently waited as the lady asked me to hold several times. I didn't mind waiting since I understand it can get busy sometimes. So what happened was that they got my order wrong after I repeated my order and the lady repeated it back to me at least 5 times. The same lady called me back when my friend went to pick it up and asked if I ordered pork and cabbage when I clearly said pork and chives and she even repeated back my order correctly. The issue today was that she was extremely rude on the phone when she called back to confirm and even hung up on me when I told her that I ordered pork and chives. My friend that went to pick it up confirmed she hung up on me while shaking her head and looking really pissed.

5 stars
If you're craving dumplings, this place will satisfy that craving. They offer a lot of dumpling flavors (pork, chicken, veggie, fish, etc). We've tried a lot of different ones and they're all tasty. My go-to is still the classic pork dumpling. You can choose to get dumplings steamed or pan fried. Order a mix to try different kinds!

5 stars
We enjoyed every single thing that we ordered. Great quality food for a decent price. Service was great but we were told to sit anywhere when we entered but none of the tables seemed clean.

This place was pretty good, my favorite thing was the flat rice noodles with beef! The soup dumplings and wontons and spicy sauce had a spicy/sour taste to them which was different and not my preference. The service was pretty good considering it was close to their closing time.

5 stars
This restaurant is a gem! My family and I have been there twice in two weeks, and this place is definitely now on our go-to list. So far we've tried the Orange Chicken, the Xaio Long Bao, the pork and the shrimp dumplings, the pork and chive dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, the crab rangoons, the green onion pancakes, the eggplant in garlic sauce (melt in your mouth!) the braised pork belly with cabbage (OMG....DELISH!), the sizzling beef, the innovative hot chocolate ganache dumplings and a few other dishes that I can't recall right now. 

Having been a chef in the food industry for many years, I notice things like how clean a place it....this place is impeccably clean with a lovely ambiance, and how professionally the food is prepared and served....this place has 5 stars in that category. The seasonings are just right, clean, fresh, neither under spiced nor over spiced. Absolutely perfect for the discerning palate. Last but not least, the owners and waitstaff are incredibly kind and accommodating, making sure that everyone has an excellent dining experience. The new owners have recently reopened and redecorated this restaurant, and revamped their menu to suit everyone's tastebuds. You must try the new Dumpling house on Parker Rd!

4 stars
I went to try this Chinese Dumpling House hidden inside a mini mall on West Parker Road, Plano TX.

I ordered Mongolian Beef from their lunch menu with white rice, hot and sour soup and egg roll included. The beef were thinly sliced and saut√©ed in onions and hosein sauce. It's delicious .

Serving Staff is friendly and helpful. The place is not fully lighted, kind a dark during lunchtime. But area is clean and well decorated. 

I will try handmade buns next time.

5 stars
The dumplings were truly amazing! The hostess was friendly and took the time to explain various food choices. She didn't push any upsells or direct me toward anything specific. The food was just as I had envisioned, especially the Mongolian beef, which looked exactly like the photo online. The beef and onion pancakes, pork and chive pan-fried dumplings, and beef short rib clay pot were all fantastic as well! I would definitely go back for more!

5 stars
Came for a light lunch on a weekend day to fuel up before we ran some errands before the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Began with the Green Onion Pancakes and Crab Rangoons. Both were excellent!! Really loved making a dipping sauce out of the Chili-Crisp and soy sauce. Both condiments readily available on your table; a nice touch!

Then we split the signature Soup Dumplings with ground pork and savory broth. We both had never had these before and were eager to try them! They were fantastic!!  Our glasses were kept full and waitstaff was attentive and the service was excellent. Costs were very appropriate for the amount of food. 

Definitely adding this to our restaurant rotation, as there's about a dozen other things on their menu I'm eager to try! I'm looking forward to trying their Pork and Chive Steamed buns, Crispy Spicy Chicken, and their dessert Chocolate Soup Dumplings sounds really intriguing!!  I didn't get any photos this time, but will do better next time.

5 stars
Everything was so good today but the new "Cheeseburger" Dumplings on the Seasonal Menu are unbelievable.  With a dab of Mustard, you will think it's a Cheeseburger.  And for dessert you must try the Chocolate Molten Boa Bun with walnuts.  Delish!!!!

4 stars
I think Dumpling House has changed ownership or just their name to Willow and Pine Dumpling House as of February 2024. We came for dinner, and I haven't been to this location in a few years, but the interior is revamped and looks more modern and inviting than it had before. Their dumplings and bao are still the stars of their menu. 

We got the boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork bao, both of which were delicious. The pork bao were very fluffy and soft, and while biting into the meat at first seemed somewhat bland, the more bites you took the more flavor seemed to come, and it was tastier the more you ate it. We also had the spicy garlic eggplant and a vegetable lo mein, which they said was vegetarian, not vegan, but we asked them to make the lo mein vegan for our friend to be able to eat and they were accomodating. These two dishes were okay, not amazing. The spicy garlic eggplant came with a small bowl of rice, and it could have been more generous. 

I do want to mention that the tableware we were given was a random mishmash; one person got a bowl and soup spoon that no one else got, three of us were given disposable chopsticks while one was given the resuable kind, and half the plates we were given were circular and half were oval-shaped. So they maybe need to work on attention to details in this aspect of restauranting! 

Also, the big menu with pictures was new and did not contain prices, and we had to ask for the prices of the dishes, which they handed to us on a longer paper menu. The dishes were still really good value, in my opinion.

The staff were nice and accommodating when we asked questions, and they came by to refill our waters pretty often. Overall, I think we had a pretty good experience, though it could be improved.

5 stars
Irene was so helpful on explaining their different types of dumplings. They were all fantastic!  Started with hot and sour soup. Arrived piping hot!   Yummy!!  Won ton soup was very tasty, the broth was full of flavor and the won tons were huge, very generous portions. The pork mdumplings we had fried and they disappeared immediately upon arrival. The steamed shrimp and pork dumplings  were generous too.  Such great fresh dishes.  We will be back!

5 stars
My husband and I decided to have dinner here Sunday night on a whim. This place is amazing. We ordered the scallion pancake, the beef roll, crab rangoons, soup dumplings, pork green beans and orange chicken. The food here tasted so authentic, the staff were super sweet and the food came out fast. My husband is usually a picky eater, and he loved the food. We live an hour away, but we definitely plan to make the trip to come back and eat here. This place is a hidden gem.

5 stars
Very good quiet little place. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all. The dumplings were delicious.  The service was great. We will go back.

Happy I found a place I like in Plano. The Lo Mein was flavorful and very garlicky (might not be everyone's cup of tea), but a tad salty. The dumplings were amazing! The dough wasn't too thick, the filling was delicious and juicing, and the pan fried crust was perfectly done. 

Service was fast and friendly and parking was easy to come by.

The food was delicious and the service was friendly, I'd definitely go back! I took some to go orders as well, package perfect for the trip.

Tucked away in the back corner of this shopping center is a Chinese restaurant that blew away my expectations. I went there on a Thursday night and expected it to be a ghost town, but it was surprisingly filled. Not packed to where it would be unpleasant, but enough people to let me know something was up. And surely enough, after trying the food, I understood why so many people were there.

I started with the egg drop soup, which had a nice deep umami flavor to set the tone. Next I tried my standard meal to test a Chinese restaurant: orange chicken with fried rice. The rice was cooked well with nice garnish of egg and garlic, but the real start was the orange chicken. Every bite was succulent, and I could tell they put time into refining the recipe. The flavor profile was a lovely balance of the sweetness from the orange itself (the dish was garnished with real orange peels) and the heat from the chilis. It was the perfect amount of heat for me -- enough to add to the flavor profile but not so much it became overpowering. I finished my meal with what has got to be this place's piece de resistance: chocolate soup dumplings.

The chocolate soup dumplings are to die for. They are worth a two hour drive to get to this place. Given this place literally has dumpling in their name I had high hopes, and they exceeded them. The chocolate soup dumplings look like any other soup dumpling, but when you bite into them you are greeted with a rush of molten chocolate that is rich and creamy. These things are crack, I recommend getting one order per person!

Overall this restaurant blew my expectations away. The staff was also very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was the star. I plan on making this place one of my regular go-to's.

I met up yet again with some girlfriends after work.  The Dumpling House has a wide variety of different types of dumplings.  We each ordered from the menu to share so I can't remember exactly each item ordered however it was all delicious, fresh and tasty...see pictures! 

Note:  They do not have alcohol that you can order however you can BYOB

4 stars
This place executes quite well what they advertise in their name. 

Atmosphere wise this place is pretty separate and bland. Service is direct and to the point. Luckily, there English was decent enough that were both understood each other. 

Steamed buns here are pretty good. Great dough that has a pronounced yeast taste and smell as they probably make their own.

Fish dumplings are something I rarely see but they are pretty good here. Not amazing like when taught truffle or pork fat  are used but still tasty none the less. 

Custard buns sucked. They didn't have much filling and fell flat in flavor. Possibly the worst custard bun I've had. 

Scallion pancakes were even better than what you get at jeng chi! Maximum crispiness with plenty of oily goodness in each bite.

5 stars
Yum! Under new management and it was wonderful. It's been a while but I was impressed by the food and the service. They remodeled a bit too and it felt much more comfortable and modern.

We have been coming here for years. And I mean like 5 years and I felt it necessary to come back and update my review after our last visit a few days ago. 
We will start with my beef noodle soup that I always get. The meat was nice and tender like always. The soup however, was nothing but a over salted beef broth. I am used to this being a very flavorful broth that bursts in your mouth with every single bite. Not the case anymore. I did read that there might be a new owner or cook and maybe that explains why the dish was changed. 
Secondly, my fianc√© always gets the same chicken and noodle dish and it's always so much food that we have to take some home. The portion was much smaller this time. 
Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone.

I thought Dumplings House was on par with my expectations. It is a smaller restaurant than I was expecting. Got the sesame chicken, onion pancake and of course, dumplings. Everything was great. It just seemed pricier than what we received but I think that's just the world we live in. Because of proximity, not sure if we would come again but if a group came we certainly would be back.

I've been here years ago and it's still very good! We ordered the pork with chives pan fried dumplings(very tasty and crispy)! We saw that they had a lunch special with come with soup and spring roll! I had the sesame chicken (there were too much sauce but it was tasty), my husband had the Mongolian beef which had way too much sauce, the portion was huge, a lot more than my sesame chicken! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful! I would definitely go back and tried other entrees!

Just revisited dumpling house again after being takeout only customers for the last year and had such an amazing experience! They have completely updated the space and it is so welcoming. 

We ordered a bunch of dumplings and buns for our table and they all came out steaming hot and flavorful. The Mapo Tofu was bursting with flavor and the perfect amount of mouth numbing spice! I have realized over the years that there is truly not one thing on this menu that isn't absolutely delicious from the orange chicken to the seasonal soup dumpling you can't go wrong! 

Not only was all the food delicious as always but the owner, Irene, and server were so attentive and kind to us during our visit. Even offering a free sample of the hot and sour soup which I HIGHLY recommend and will be ordering every visit from now on! Don't miss this hidden gem for take out or dine in with a large group because it is the best combination of affordable, well run and delicious!

Always trying to support small businesses, we made a stop at Dumpling House. We tried a variety of things from the menu, which was all a bit lackluster. 

Beef pancakes: 3/5 lots of soup inside and crispy on the outside! Wish it was a little more flavorful but overall pretty decent

Beef rolls: 2/5 not bad! It could just use some more sauce and could be fried a little crispier

Braised beef noodle soup: 2/5 broth was too salty and lacked depth in flavor. Noodles were ok but nothing special. Would recommend skipping this and getting some other options on the menu 

Soup dumplings (pork): 2/5 decent filling and had a lot of soup inside! But not very rich in flavor and the wrappers were much too thick

String beans with minced pork: 5/5 easily the best dish we got! Hard to go wrong, and there was a lot of pork bits to add to the flavor!

House signature handmade bao: 3/5 these were definitely one of the better things on the menu! Felt homemade but not particularly memorable. 

Overall, somewhat decent food, and the staff was exceptionally kind! Maybe we just didn't order the right 
things!

We have been looking for a great Chinese place to start frequenting and we have finally found our spot!! My husband said the fried dumpling was the BEST he's ever had. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (so crispy even with lots of sauce), and the chow mein was so flavorful! The staff were super nice and the hostess was a really sweetie!

This looks like they had the same menu at one time as the Frisco location but it is pared down now. Soda is by the can with no free refills. 2025 is not starting out well for them. The heating doesn't work. They put a tiny space heater across from our table when we sat down. We were the only customers Friday at lunch-never a good sign. A lady was running an old wet rag across the tables, leaving everything sopping wet, then proceeded to put thin paper napkins on top of the wet table. We sat there for about 10 minutes trying to flag down someone to take our order. They saw us, we were the only people there, but just never came to take our order. We got up and left and they didn't seem surprised. This area of Plano used to be thriving, now it looks like a ghost town. Maybe if they get the heating fixed things will improve. I doubt I'll be back

I really liked the dumplings here, but the customer service was really bad today. I ordered to-go on the phone and patiently waited as the lady asked me to hold several times. I didn't mind waiting since I understand it can get busy sometimes. So what happened was that they got my order wrong after I repeated my order and the lady repeated it back to me at least 5 times. The same lady called me back when my friend went to pick it up and asked if I ordered pork and cabbage when I clearly said pork and chives and she even repeated back my order correctly. The issue today was that she was extremely rude on the phone when she called back to confirm and even hung up on me when I told her that I ordered pork and chives. My friend that went to pick it up confirmed she hung up on me while shaking her head and looking really pissed.

5 stars
If you're craving dumplings, this place will satisfy that craving. They offer a lot of dumpling flavors (pork, chicken, veggie, fish, etc). We've tried a lot of different ones and they're all tasty. My go-to is still the classic pork dumpling. You can choose to get dumplings steamed or pan fried. Order a mix to try different kinds!

5 stars
We enjoyed every single thing that we ordered. Great quality food for a decent price. Service was great but we were told to sit anywhere when we entered but none of the tables seemed clean.

3 stars
This place was pretty good, my favorite thing was the flat rice noodles with beef! The soup dumplings and wontons and spicy sauce had a spicy/sour taste to them which was different and not my preference. The service was pretty good considering it was close to their closing time.

5 stars
This restaurant is a gem! My family and I have been there twice in two weeks, and this place is definitely now on our go-to list. So far we've tried the Orange Chicken, the Xaio Long Bao, the pork and the shrimp dumplings, the pork and chive dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, the crab rangoons, the green onion pancakes, the eggplant in garlic sauce (melt in your mouth!) the braised pork belly with cabbage (OMG....DELISH!), the sizzling beef, the innovative hot chocolate ganache dumplings and a few other dishes that I can't recall right now. 

Having been a chef in the food industry for many years, I notice things like how clean a place it....this place is impeccably clean with a lovely ambiance, and how professionally the food is prepared and served....this place has 5 stars in that category. The seasonings are just right, clean, fresh, neither under spiced nor over spiced. Absolutely perfect for the discerning palate. Last but not least, the owners and waitstaff are incredibly kind and accommodating, making sure that everyone has an excellent dining experience. The new owners have recently reopened and redecorated this restaurant, and revamped their menu to suit everyone's tastebuds. You must try the new Dumpling house on Parker Rd!

I went to try this Chinese Dumpling House hidden inside a mini mall on West Parker Road, Plano TX.

I ordered Mongolian Beef from their lunch menu with white rice, hot and sour soup and egg roll included. The beef were thinly sliced and saut√©ed in onions and hosein sauce. It's delicious .

Serving Staff is friendly and helpful. The place is not fully lighted, kind a dark during lunchtime. But area is clean and well decorated. 

I will try handmade buns next time.

5 stars
The dumplings were truly amazing! The hostess was friendly and took the time to explain various food choices. She didn't push any upsells or direct me toward anything specific. The food was just as I had envisioned, especially the Mongolian beef, which looked exactly like the photo online. The beef and onion pancakes, pork and chive pan-fried dumplings, and beef short rib clay pot were all fantastic as well! I would definitely go back for more!

5 stars
Came for a light lunch on a weekend day to fuel up before we ran some errands before the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Began with the Green Onion Pancakes and Crab Rangoons. Both were excellent!! Really loved making a dipping sauce out of the Chili-Crisp and soy sauce. Both condiments readily available on your table; a nice touch!

Then we split the signature Soup Dumplings with ground pork and savory broth. We both had never had these before and were eager to try them! They were fantastic!!  Our glasses were kept full and waitstaff was attentive and the service was excellent. Costs were very appropriate for the amount of food. 

Definitely adding this to our restaurant rotation, as there's about a dozen other things on their menu I'm eager to try! I'm looking forward to trying their Pork and Chive Steamed buns, Crispy Spicy Chicken, and their dessert Chocolate Soup Dumplings sounds really intriguing!!  I didn't get any photos this time, but will do better next time.

5 stars
Everything was so good today but the new "Cheeseburger" Dumplings on the Seasonal Menu are unbelievable.  With a dab of Mustard, you will think it's a Cheeseburger.  And for dessert you must try the Chocolate Molten Boa Bun with walnuts.  Delish!!!!

4 stars
I think Dumpling House has changed ownership or just their name to Willow and Pine Dumpling House as of February 2024. We came for dinner, and I haven't been to this location in a few years, but the interior is revamped and looks more modern and inviting than it had before. Their dumplings and bao are still the stars of their menu. 

We got the boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork bao, both of which were delicious. The pork bao were very fluffy and soft, and while biting into the meat at first seemed somewhat bland, the more bites you took the more flavor seemed to come, and it was tastier the more you ate it. We also had the spicy garlic eggplant and a vegetable lo mein, which they said was vegetarian, not vegan, but we asked them to make the lo mein vegan for our friend to be able to eat and they were accomodating. These two dishes were okay, not amazing. The spicy garlic eggplant came with a small bowl of rice, and it could have been more generous. 

I do want to mention that the tableware we were given was a random mishmash; one person got a bowl and soup spoon that no one else got, three of us were given disposable chopsticks while one was given the resuable kind, and half the plates we were given were circular and half were oval-shaped. So they maybe need to work on attention to details in this aspect of restauranting! 

Also, the big menu with pictures was new and did not contain prices, and we had to ask for the prices of the dishes, which they handed to us on a longer paper menu. The dishes were still really good value, in my opinion.

The staff were nice and accommodating when we asked questions, and they came by to refill our waters pretty often. Overall, I think we had a pretty good experience, though it could be improved.

5 stars
Irene was so helpful on explaining their different types of dumplings. They were all fantastic!  Started with hot and sour soup. Arrived piping hot!   Yummy!!  Won ton soup was very tasty, the broth was full of flavor and the won tons were huge, very generous portions. The pork mdumplings we had fried and they disappeared immediately upon arrival. The steamed shrimp and pork dumplings  were generous too.  Such great fresh dishes.  We will be back!

5 stars
My husband and I decided to have dinner here Sunday night on a whim. This place is amazing. We ordered the scallion pancake, the beef roll, crab rangoons, soup dumplings, pork green beans and orange chicken. The food here tasted so authentic, the staff were super sweet and the food came out fast. My husband is usually a picky eater, and he loved the food. We live an hour away, but we definitely plan to make the trip to come back and eat here. This place is a hidden gem.

5 stars
Very good quiet little place. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all. The dumplings were delicious.  The service was great. We will go back.

4 stars
Happy I found a place I like in Plano. The Lo Mein was flavorful and very garlicky (might not be everyone's cup of tea), but a tad salty. The dumplings were amazing! The dough wasn't too thick, the filling was delicious and juicing, and the pan fried crust was perfectly done. 

Service was fast and friendly and parking was easy to come by.

5 stars
The food was delicious and the service was friendly, I'd definitely go back! I took some to go orders as well, package perfect for the trip.

Tucked away in the back corner of this shopping center is a Chinese restaurant that blew away my expectations. I went there on a Thursday night and expected it to be a ghost town, but it was surprisingly filled. Not packed to where it would be unpleasant, but enough people to let me know something was up. And surely enough, after trying the food, I understood why so many people were there.

I started with the egg drop soup, which had a nice deep umami flavor to set the tone. Next I tried my standard meal to test a Chinese restaurant: orange chicken with fried rice. The rice was cooked well with nice garnish of egg and garlic, but the real start was the orange chicken. Every bite was succulent, and I could tell they put time into refining the recipe. The flavor profile was a lovely balance of the sweetness from the orange itself (the dish was garnished with real orange peels) and the heat from the chilis. It was the perfect amount of heat for me -- enough to add to the flavor profile but not so much it became overpowering. I finished my meal with what has got to be this place's piece de resistance: chocolate soup dumplings.

The chocolate soup dumplings are to die for. They are worth a two hour drive to get to this place. Given this place literally has dumpling in their name I had high hopes, and they exceeded them. The chocolate soup dumplings look like any other soup dumpling, but when you bite into them you are greeted with a rush of molten chocolate that is rich and creamy. These things are crack, I recommend getting one order per person!

Overall this restaurant blew my expectations away. The staff was also very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was the star. I plan on making this place one of my regular go-to's.

Had a wonderful meal at Dumpling House. The staff was very kind and the food was great! 

The place is authentic, no frills, and portion sizes were generous.

Parking is easy, and adjacent to the restaurant right out right.

I met up yet again with some girlfriends after work.  The Dumpling House has a wide variety of different types of dumplings.  We each ordered from the menu to share so I can't remember exactly each item ordered however it was all delicious, fresh and tasty...see pictures! 

Note:  They do not have alcohol that you can order however you can BYOB

4 stars
This place executes quite well what they advertise in their name. 

Atmosphere wise this place is pretty separate and bland. Service is direct and to the point. Luckily, there English was decent enough that were both understood each other. 

Steamed buns here are pretty good. Great dough that has a pronounced yeast taste and smell as they probably make their own.

Fish dumplings are something I rarely see but they are pretty good here. Not amazing like when taught truffle or pork fat  are used but still tasty none the less. 

Custard buns sucked. They didn't have much filling and fell flat in flavor. Possibly the worst custard bun I've had. 

Scallion pancakes were even better than what you get at jeng chi! Maximum crispiness with plenty of oily goodness in each bite.

5 stars
Yum! Under new management and it was wonderful. It's been a while but I was impressed by the food and the service. They remodeled a bit too and it felt much more comfortable and modern.

We have been coming here for years. And I mean like 5 years and I felt it necessary to come back and update my review after our last visit a few days ago. 
We will start with my beef noodle soup that I always get. The meat was nice and tender like always. The soup however, was nothing but a over salted beef broth. I am used to this being a very flavorful broth that bursts in your mouth with every single bite. Not the case anymore. I did read that there might be a new owner or cook and maybe that explains why the dish was changed. 
Secondly, my fianc√© always gets the same chicken and noodle dish and it's always so much food that we have to take some home. The portion was much smaller this time. 
Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone. The whole rush of the "hurry up and order, eat and get out" feeling was super real. I do not like that. We would have left by 9:30 without any of the rushing around us. 
I do appreciate that we are still able to bring our own wine in to enjoy with our meal. 
I just feel that every customer, from the first to the last, should be treated as if they are wanted in the establishment. It costs a lot of money to treat yourself these days by going out to eat.

My first visit to the Dumpling House in Plano, and the food is terrific!  Service was quick as well and it made for a delicious lunch.

The food is amazing and wonderfully cooked! I love it so much I went twice in one week! Irene is the owner has been so awesome and even remembered my name. The Ambiance has been changed up and is awesome and more open now that the cocoon has been removed and has a more modern look.

As soon as you enter, you know if you are the target audience or not.

I was not the target audience for this establishment. The dishes are a bit pricey, the portions small, and look nothing like the pictures they have.

Beef roll looked like a skinny burrito.
Crispy pork were slivers of meat.
Dishes tasted like they came from premade packages.

There is more but as mentioned, not the target audience.

Food is excellent. Delicious, fresh me made and dare I say made with love?! It how it tastes. Quick and easy. Do yourself a favor just try it!

We came here on Sunday night. It was still early so there was no wait. We've been to the one in Frisco, but first time here at Plano location. 

There are good amount of seatings inside and family friendly ambiance. We had beef noodle soup, stir fry noodles, fried rice and beef wraps. Everything was so great and I feel like it's a lot better than the Frisco location. It's also less crowded!

1 stars
Not good for me. The flat beef noodles were dry and the beef was super tough.  The sauce was good. Also the noodles were stuck together and some were hard.

Placed order here and the restaurant waited an hour to cancel it. Attempted to reorder again and the restaurant waited another 45 minutes to cancel order with no reason once more. Don't waste your time with this one.

This place is SOOO GOOD. Everything is perfect I got the dumplings, house signature bun (steamed) chicken fried rice and veggie lo mein. Everything is cooked to perfection ! The people in there took care of us and were super kind! I want to say we waited about 15-20 minutes but even just sitting inside felt so nostalgic ! The food is definitely authentic. Next time we'll stay to eat inside!

1 stars
Food and service are disgusting. Dumplings are undercooked and tasted terrible. Also we took to-go and the rest of our Oder was wrong. I called to tell them and they said you ordered what you got. Don't waist your money. The food we received had NO FLAVOR!

1 stars
Pretty disappointed. Heard great things. We ordered house buns(didn't care for), fried pork and scallion dumplings(very good), soup dumplings(pretty good, beef roll(enjoyed this), and combo fried rice. They gave us lo mein and we didn't notice until we got home. Called to get it corrected and the kid hung up on us. Service was meh from the get go. Sad because this place may be really good but the staff has a bad attitude and doesn't really care. They're just there for a check and could care less about the customers.

First and last time!  I walked in to pick up a to go order, and stood at the register by the entrance for a solid 3 minutes in front of 2 employees. They finally said to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. I was asked "what I needed" as o said I'm here to pick up my order. I told him my name and he said what's your order number. I walked back out to the car to get my phone. I have them the order number he hands me my food. The whole exchange was weird and rude. The food sucked. The spicy pork was swimming in a pool of oil, the fried rice noodles with beef tasted like plastic, the orange chicken was chewy, and the egg rolls tasted off. I didn't even bother calling, as I didn't want to hear any excuses.

5 stars
We ordered several items and everything came out hot and fresh. The soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, steamed bun, and general tso chicken was some of the best we've had anywhere.

5 stars
Obsessed. Every time I hear of someone going to North Dallas (regardless of reason) I recommend this place while aggressively insisting they bring me home lots of steam buns. The actual restaurant is unassuming and staff is helpful. Driving 45 minutes across the metroplex for these cherished buns was worth every ounce of stained tshirt and steering wheel! The mini-trek was a birthday well spent and well fed!

5 stars
Every bite is so fresh and delicious in every dish we've ever tried here. Even the rice somehow tastes better than anywhere else. 
Seafood, veggies, spices, soup dumplings, fried and steamed dumplings, garlic pepper shrimp, everything was just so unbelievably tasty. 
This place is fail-proof! 
And the chocolate dumplings are worth the trip alone!

3 stars
I will see they have a ton of parking and the staff is very nice, but the food is kind of mid.

I got the soup dumplings and they were really good, but I don't think I've ever had soup dumplings that I don't like. With a decent amount of meat inside and the dumpling wrapper didn't fall apart so easily that I lost all soup in transit . I would totally get these again.

The big bummer was the DanDan noodles. They were way too vinegar tasting, and didn't have almost any other flavoring. I even left most of the meat because it was kind of flavorless.

5 stars
Really liked this place! I had the lunch special for $12.99 which included hot and sour soup (delicious!), an egg roll, and a choice of American-Chinese cuisine (I had orange chicken, there was general Tsao's, that sort of thing). However they also had xiao long bao, a variety of pan fried and steamed dumplings, and other authentic fare. I liked it so much I ended up ordering an entire meal for my family for later  I ordered traditional soup dumplings, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, chicken chow mein, took my leftovers (which was a lot!), and an order of their own design, chocolate soup dumplings! I have bamboo steam baskets at home so it was easy to reheat things. My family raved and my kids gobbled it up. 

I sat near the owner who was the absolute nicest - he is French and his partner/girlfriend is from Hong Kong. They just took it over 4 months ago and made some nice changes to the inside and menu changes as well. The kitchen staff is still the same. 

Go try it!!

3 stars
Very aesthetically pleasing, service was great and attentive, good location, I've been to several different dumping locations and unfortunately this is one of the ones that I didn't like. The soup dumplings were not good tasting, the walnut shrimp had too much mayonnaise and the shrimps were low quality, the cucumber salad had a ginger flavor instead of a garlic flavor but maybe that's they way it was supposed to be just not good in flavor. The green onion pancakes were delicious and the fried pork chive dumplings were good. 

Thanks for the experience.

Everything was so good today but the new "Cheeseburger" Dumplings on the Seasonal Menu are unbelievable.  With a dab of Mustard, you will think it's a Cheeseburger.  And for dessert you must try the Chocolate Molten Boa Bun with walnuts.  Delish!!!!

I think Dumpling House has changed ownership or just their name to Willow and Pine Dumpling House as of February 2024. We came for dinner, and I haven't been to this location in a few years, but the interior is revamped and looks more modern and inviting than it had before. Their dumplings and bao are still the stars of their menu. 

We got the boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork bao, both of which were delicious. The pork bao were very fluffy and soft, and while biting into the meat at first seemed somewhat bland, the more bites you took the more flavor seemed to come, and it was tastier the more you ate it. We also had the spicy garlic eggplant and a vegetable lo mein, which they said was vegetarian, not vegan, but we asked them to make the lo mein vegan for our friend to be able to eat and they were accomodating. These two dishes were okay, not amazing. The spicy garlic eggplant came with a small bowl of rice, and it could have been more generous. 

I do want to mention that the tableware we were given was a random mishmash; one person got a bowl and soup spoon that no one else got, three of us were given disposable chopsticks while one was given the resuable kind, and half the plates we were given were circular and half were oval-shaped. So they maybe need to work on attention to details in this aspect of restauranting! 

Also, the big menu with pictures was new and did not contain prices, and we had to ask for the prices of the dishes, which they handed to us on a longer paper menu. The dishes were still really good value, in my opinion.

The staff were nice and accommodating when we asked questions, and they came by to refill our waters pretty often. Overall, I think we had a pretty good experience, though it could be improved.

Irene was so helpful on explaining their different types of dumplings. They were all fantastic!  Started with hot and sour soup. Arrived piping hot!   Yummy!!  Won ton soup was very tasty, the broth was full of flavor and the won tons were huge, very generous portions. The pork mdumplings we had fried and they disappeared immediately upon arrival. The steamed shrimp and pork dumplings  were generous too.  Such great fresh dishes.  We will be back!

My husband and I decided to have dinner here Sunday night on a whim. This place is amazing. We ordered the scallion pancake, the beef roll, crab rangoons, soup dumplings, pork green beans and orange chicken. The food here tasted so authentic, the staff were super sweet and the food came out fast. My husband is usually a picky eater, and he loved the food. We live an hour away, but we definitely plan to make the trip to come back and eat here. This place is a hidden gem.

Very good quiet little place. We went on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy at all. The dumplings were delicious.  The service was great. We will go back.

Happy I found a place I like in Plano. The Lo Mein was flavorful and very garlicky (might not be everyone's cup of tea), but a tad salty. The dumplings were amazing! The dough wasn't too thick, the filling was delicious and juicing, and the pan fried crust was perfectly done. 

Service was fast and friendly and parking was easy to come by.

The food was delicious and the service was friendly, I'd definitely go back! I took some to go orders as well, package perfect for the trip.

Tucked away in the back corner of this shopping center is a Chinese restaurant that blew away my expectations. I went there on a Thursday night and expected it to be a ghost town, but it was surprisingly filled. Not packed to where it would be unpleasant, but enough people to let me know something was up. And surely enough, after trying the food, I understood why so many people were there.

I started with the egg drop soup, which had a nice deep umami flavor to set the tone. Next I tried my standard meal to test a Chinese restaurant: orange chicken with fried rice. The rice was cooked well with nice garnish of egg and garlic, but the real start was the orange chicken. Every bite was succulent, and I could tell they put time into refining the recipe. The flavor profile was a lovely balance of the sweetness from the orange itself (the dish was garnished with real orange peels) and the heat from the chilis. It was the perfect amount of heat for me -- enough to add to the flavor profile but not so much it became overpowering. I finished my meal with what has got to be this place's piece de resistance: chocolate soup dumplings.

The chocolate soup dumplings are to die for. They are worth a two hour drive to get to this place. Given this place literally has dumpling in their name I had high hopes, and they exceeded them. The chocolate soup dumplings look like any other soup dumpling, but when you bite into them you are greeted with a rush of molten chocolate that is rich and creamy. These things are crack, I recommend getting one order per person!

Overall this restaurant blew my expectations away. The staff was also very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was the star. I plan on making this place one of my regular go-to's.

Had a wonderful meal at Dumpling House. The staff was very kind and the food was great! 

The place is authentic, no frills, and portion sizes were generous.

Parking is easy, and adjacent to the restaurant right out right.

I met up yet again with some girlfriends after work.  The Dumpling House has a wide variety of different types of dumplings.  We each ordered from the menu to share so I can't remember exactly each item ordered however it was all delicious, fresh and tasty...see pictures! 

Note:  They do not have alcohol that you can order however you can BYOB

This place executes quite well what they advertise in their name. 

Atmosphere wise this place is pretty separate and bland. Service is direct and to the point. Luckily, there English was decent enough that were both understood each other. 

Steamed buns here are pretty good. Great dough that has a pronounced yeast taste and smell as they probably make their own.

Fish dumplings are something I rarely see but they are pretty good here. Not amazing like when taught truffle or pork fat  are used but still tasty none the less. 

Custard buns sucked. They didn't have much filling and fell flat in flavor. Possibly the worst custard bun I've had. 

Scallion pancakes were even better than what you get at jeng chi! Maximum crispiness with plenty of oily goodness in each bite.

5 stars
Yum! Under new management and it was wonderful. It's been a while but I was impressed by the food and the service. They remodeled a bit too and it felt much more comfortable and modern.

We have been coming here for years. And I mean like 5 years and I felt it necessary to come back and update my review after our last visit a few days ago. 
We will start with my beef noodle soup that I always get. The meat was nice and tender like always. The soup however, was nothing but a over salted beef broth. I am used to this being a very flavorful broth that bursts in your mouth with every single bite. Not the case anymore. I did read that there might be a new owner or cook and maybe that explains why the dish was changed. 
Secondly, my fianc√© always gets the same chicken and noodle dish and it's always so much food that we have to take some home. The portion was much smaller this time. 
Lastly, we came in around 8:30. Restaurant closes at 9:30. Boy howdy if we didn't feel like they wanted us to get the heck out of there. Our server was nice but in a major hurry for us to leave. She didn't even have to say it. We could feel it. Cleaning our table and around it while we were still there. The second our plates are empty, they are gone. The whole rush of the "hurry up and order, eat and get out" feeling was super real. I do not like that. We would have left by 9:30 without any of the rushing around us. 
I do appreciate that we are still able to bring our own wine in to enjoy with our meal. 
I just feel that every customer, from the first to the last, should be treated as if they are wanted in the establishment. It costs a lot of money to treat yourself these days by going out to eat.

My first visit to the Dumpling House in Plano, and the food is terrific!  Service was quick as well and it made for a delicious lunch.

The food is amazing, I've enjoyed it twice this week.  Go to place for me. The Orange Chicken is one of the best I have had.  Everything is fresh and tasty.

The food is amazing and wonderfully cooked! I love it so much I went twice in one week! Irene is the owner has been so awesome and even remembered my name. The Ambiance has been changed up and is awesome and more open now that the cocoon has been removed and has a more modern look.

As soon as you enter, you know if you are the target audience or not.

I was not the target audience for this establishment. The dishes are a bit pricey, the portions small, and look nothing like the pictures they have.

Beef roll looked like a skinny burrito.
Crispy pork were slivers of meat.
Dishes tasted like they came from premade packages.

There is more but as mentioned, not the target audience.

I stumbled upon this gem some years back. I have always loved their food and had to come back after a few years of being away. We ordered the fried pork and scallion dumplings, and curry noodles were delicious!

We came here on Sunday night. It was still early so there was no wait. We've been to the one in Frisco, but first time here at Plano location. 

There are good amount of seatings inside and family friendly ambiance. We had beef noodle soup, stir fry noodles, fried rice and beef wraps. Everything was so great and I feel like it's a lot better than the Frisco location. It's also less crowded!

Not good for me. The flat beef noodles were dry and the beef was super tough.  The sauce was good. Also the noodles were stuck together and some were hard.

Placed order here and the restaurant waited an hour to cancel it. Attempted to reorder again and the restaurant waited another 45 minutes to cancel order with no reason once more. Don't waste your time with this one.

This place is SOOO GOOD. Everything is perfect I got the dumplings, house signature bun (steamed) chicken fried rice and veggie lo mein. Everything is cooked to perfection ! The people in there took care of us and were super kind! I want to say we waited about 15-20 minutes but even just sitting inside felt so nostalgic ! The food is definitely authentic. Next time we'll stay to eat inside!

Food and service are disgusting. Dumplings are undercooked and tasted terrible. Also we took to-go and the rest of our Oder was wrong. I called to tell them and they said you ordered what you got. Don't waist your money. The food we received had NO FLAVOR!

1 stars
Pretty disappointed. Heard great things. We ordered house buns(didn't care for), fried pork and scallion dumplings(very good), soup dumplings(pretty good, beef roll(enjoyed this), and combo fried rice. They gave us lo mein and we didn't notice until we got home. Called to get it corrected and the kid hung up on us. Service was meh from the get go. Sad because this place may be really good but the staff has a bad attitude and doesn't really care. They're just there for a check and could care less about the customers.

First and last time!  I walked in to pick up a to go order, and stood at the register by the entrance for a solid 3 minutes in front of 2 employees. They finally said to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. I was asked "what I needed" as o said I'm here to pick up my order. I told him my name and he said what's your order number. I walked back out to the car to get my phone. I have them the order number he hands me my food. The whole exchange was weird and rude. The food sucked. The spicy pork was swimming in a pool of oil, the fried rice noodles with beef tasted like plastic, the orange chicken was chewy, and the egg rolls tasted off. I didn't even bother calling, as I didn't want to hear any excuses.

We ordered several items and everything came out hot and fresh. The soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, steamed bun, and general tso chicken was some of the best we've had anywhere.

Obsessed. Every time I hear of someone going to North Dallas (regardless of reason) I recommend this place while aggressively insisting they bring me home lots of steam buns. The actual restaurant is unassuming and staff is helpful. Driving 45 minutes across the metroplex for these cherished buns was worth every ounce of stained tshirt and steering wheel! The mini-trek was a birthday well spent and well fed!
