Review: At first I was a little skeptical about SauceBros because there's a million pizzerias nearby so why go to one in Plano? The search for great pizza of course. Ryan said he had already done the homework and Frisco was out of good pizza places. Trust. 

This place is literally hole in the wall. There is no restroom nor a whole lot of place to sit. In fact I literally questioned Ryan on whether or not we'd actually get a seat here at this place on a Sunday night. My fears were eased when we rolled in and scored the seats by the window. 

We ordered an naga habanero half chicken and half beef bengali beef pesto pizza using their kiosk. I also wised up and ordered a side of garlic for dipping and hot honey right on the pizza itself. A fantastic combination I might add. *Pats self on the back*. They use the super Costco pizza ovens so several can go in at once.

It's probably better to order ahead of time instead of sitting around and waiting (they do doordash/phone/online orders too). There were several people that came in to pick up their to-go orders. I wouldn't dine-in here unless you have no other place to eat your pizza. Their beverage selection was pricey and was also a little lackluster so don't count on them having what you want.

Review: This pizza is FIRE. The pizza is fantastic -- get the Harissa Chicken, the Korean BBQ Beef, and the 4 Cheese W/ Honey. I get my extra crispy and it comes out perfect! Great service, quick and easy for Takeout (they only have a couple seats to eat in). The staff is very kind!

Review: A solid place to try out if you want to try unique pizza flavors! This place is an Indian-style pizza place that has unique fusions. The store is really really small so I recommend ordering ahead for takeout if you're going with friends. The service was great and the staff were friendly. I preferred the beef taco pizza flavor over the Naga habanero chicken but both were definitely unique. The chicken Alfredo was pretty good with the flavor that you would expect. I would recommend to come try it out at least once and see how yuh like it!

Review: We ordered one each of the  Meat Lovers and BBQ Korean pizzas and each one tasted exactly the same.  This place was overhyped by Dallas Morning News and left us $80 poorer. Who spends $80 for pizza??? Definitely not us again.

Waay too much BBQ sauce which took away from the taste of the actual pizza itself. When one orders a pizza, one expects a tomato or white sauce, not BBQ sauce as the main ingredient. The sauce made the pizza almost sickeningly sweet and we had to throw over half of it away. Will never order from this place again.

Review: I have been waiting to try this place for so long, but they're closed on Mondays when I'm usually free. Finally hit them up on another weekday evening and it was fire! I called ahead 15 mins to place a take out order. The interior is veryyy small so I'd suggest you order for take out. They allow you to do 2 different flavors on a pizza so we tried the Korean Bbq and the naga habanero chicken. I loved that they ask how spicy you want the naga habanero to be and it's legit spicy so beware! The Korean bbq imo just tasted like American bbq sauce but it was still good. My favorite was the naga habanero. I would come back and order the naga plus a new flavor to try!

Review: I am picky when it comes to pizza and that's because I have tried a lot! This is hands down the best pizza I have had in DFW. I recently moved to Plano and found them on UberEats. AMAZING. I've order at least 10 times now in the past few months. If you love a rich sweet red wine sauce, this is the pizza place for you. My only complaint is not being able to order on UberEats until after 3 pm but it's probably because they're so busy making that sauce with love that it takes a little more time. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Review: I was so excited to find out about this place and my first pizza which was simply the beef pepperoni and cheese was great! I have to admit in full disclosure that I am a very picky pizza eater being from the NYC area originally. I love a thin crispy crust and have always been a fan of beef pepperoni on a pizza. We were so excited, we thought finally we have found a great pizza place! Unfortunately, the next two pizzas that I ordered were totally different from the first one that I received. Exact same order other than I added additional beef pepperoni. But on the second two, the crust wasn't crispy and it was hard to believe that these had come from the same place that I had gotten the same pizza from just a week earlier. It was just OK and for the price I paid for six slices of pizza and the large size. I know that unfortunately I will still be looking for a great thin crispy crust pizza. My hopes were high, but unfortunately, the consistency was not there. With the number of people in West Plano that are from the east coast it seems unbelievable that we can't get great pizza in this area.

Review: This isn't your typical pizza place. They have mostly exotic style pizza. Way too expensive imo. We got the traditional pepperoni, which was good for $10. Unfortunately, they charge $17. No way! We also got a weird specialty pizza and it wasn't even edible. The owner was very nice and even gave us a free pizza, knowing the one we got was a required taste. So he recommended the taco pizza. At first bite, it reminded me nothing of a taco but the ingredients were similar. It was spicy /5/10 and pretty tasty. But again, $23, way too expensive and not even for their largest pizza

- I have become a huge pizza fan after discovering @saucebrosusa  and their employee is the sweetest!
- This pizza is PACKED with AUTHENTIC flavor you cannot find anywhere else especially on a pizza! I was so surprised the beef taco side tasted like authentic Mexican street tacos especially with that spicy green sauce. 
- The nago habanero line (they have chicken, paneer, etc) is basically Desi food on top of pizza and it is actually the best combination ever. The spice level is top tier 
- I cannot wait to go back and order more of their flavors!

Can't wait to try the other pizzas! I'll be back soon!

Review: I tried this place because it had so many good reviews. Where I think I went wrong was ordering a cheese pizza like a build your own because I was craving pepperoni, mushroom, jalapeño pizza.SauceBros has a lot of specialty pizzas and I should have started off with one of those. My pizza was good, but I have had better. I wish there would have been more pepperonis and the jalapeños were very small. Also, I ordered via Grubhub which took 40 extra mins. My second mistake. By the time it got here, it was cold. I will have to try this place again, but will go there in person and try something that they are known for off their menu.

Review: Amazing thin crust pizzas with classic and unique flavors. Tried cheese with honey, naga chicken, pepperoni and naga mushroom. All 4 were absolutely mindblowingly delicious. Definitely coming back for more. I wish the owners would expand to downtown Dallas as a second location so I can get my fix more easily.

Review: After hearing about the pizza from here from multiple people I finally gave this place a shot. I definitely recommend it, as the pizza flavors are innovative and delicious. 8.5/10 for me. The vibes inside are that of a typical small pizza joint, and really added to the experience for me.
----
We got the Bongo Tex Mex with ranch on the side. The Alfredo sauce really tied everything together and the beef was juicy and delicious. The only complaint we had was there was a bit too much grease, which made it a bit soggy as the crust was also quite thin.

Rating: 2 stars
Review: I went here for the first time based upon the reviews.

I got the meat lovers and it was nothing special. I am not sure why this place is so popular. Price was also expensive as they don't have small sizes. They sell pizzas only in 14 and 16 inches. Also, if you order online, they charge you extra fees for that. Not sure who does that. 

I am not sure if I will go back again or not.

Review: I really wanted to like this place as the owners were so nice, but that's not the case. I ordered 2 pizzas recently (meat lovers and basic cheese) and they were so inedible that we each ate one piece and literally threw away over $50 worth of pizza. The crust was fine, but nothing special. The cheese pizza crust was burnt on the bottom. I don't mind a little char from the ovens, but this went beyond that.
Worst part is the lack of sauce. It was almost undetectable. You would think with the name "sauce" in their name that that wouldn't be an issue. Worst part was the cheese and toppings. The sausage and pepperoni tasted off and the meat lovers seemed burnt on the top. The cheese didn't taste like a typical pizza cheese either. I honestly don't know how you would mess up a pizza that bad, but none of us could stomach another slice.
Maybe it was just an off day for this place, but I am truly baffled by the great reviews. I also might have given them a little grace had the pizza not been so expensive as well as the nearly $5 in fees extra fees added to the online order through their website. I would not have tipped had I noticed the extra fees in the order already.

Review: Phenomenal NY-Style pizza!

Second time coming here and one of the best NY Style Pie's in the city! Added bonus that the Beef Pepperoni is halal and much tastier than what I've had at other places.

Sauce was slightly too sweet this time but it seems that it was a one-off issue, as it generally has been a hit in the past.

Review: I visited this place last week and I was pleasantly surprised! My older son wanted a pizza and he wanted something different from the typical cheese and pepperoni pizza flavors. I searched Yelp and found this place and I am glad I did. We ordered the Shrimp Naga pizza and the Chicken Naga pizza. The guy who took my order over the phone was very friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us when we asked to have spicy sauce on the side for the spicy lovers in our group. He even walked the pizza out to our car when we arrived to pick it up. He told us more about the pizza and how he came up with the toppings for the two pizzas. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure.  

Nevertheless the pizzas were hot and delicious! The Naga sauce is very tasty, was sweet, spicy, and tangy, truly amazing! It's definitely a must try. The only thing I would change would be to add red onions to the Spicy Naga Chicken, I will add it as a topping next time bc it compliments the flavor profile so well. Unfortunately, my kids dug in as soon as I drove off so I don't have any pictures to share! I will definitely get some on the next visit. I'd love to have this place in my neighborhood!

Review: Decided to check out this place after seeing all the rave reviews and photos. Was not disappointed! The ordering process was quick and easy, and the pizza was ready within 10-15 minutes. The owners said every meat item on their menu is hand slaughtered halal, so that's an extra plus. Since we couldn't decide which specialty pizza to try first, we decided to do an X-Large (16-in) half and half with 1/2 Spicy Chicken Naga and 1/2 Meat Lovers.

The Spicy Naga Chicken Pizza tastes like a really good butter chicken pizza but with a little extra kick to it, and the Meat Lovers pizza is also packed with flavor in every bite and theres a generous amount of meat spread throughout! For as much meat and sauce as there was in the pizza, fortunately it wasn't too greasy and you won't end up feeling bloated or like you're having a GERD episode afterwards.

If you enjoy a NY thin crust style pizza or lots of flavor, this place will be right up your alley. If you're a "pizza snob" who watches the One Bite pizza reviews, there's a great amount of flavor and crisp in each bite, and I'd recommend waiting a few minutes before digging in so that you experience a stronger undercarriage and less flop with all the sauces and toppings these pizzas hold.

Had a chance to speak with one of the owners as well, and they were super generous and you can tell that these dudes are super passionate about their pizza! Definitely plan on coming back here often to try out their other specialty pizzas.

Review: Recently tried this place for the first time. The owner  (I believe he was the owner) was very welcoming and helpful, he walked us thru the menu and provided more info and recommendations. The garlic ghee mushroom was my favorite, a lot of great flavor. Unfortunately the cheese pizza was underwhelming. I was expecting a classic cheese pizza but it was more like a margarita pizza.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Great pizza! The Naga sauce is actually spicy! And the garlic ghee mushroom hits the spot!
The texture of the dough is a little stiff, however the flavor of it is comparable to sourdough. They are really friendly when you pick up and the pizzas are ready pretty fast! 
Definitely worth the try, and if you have to... the drive!

Review: After reading it was one of the best Pizzas 2023 we decided to visit.  I had searched for the top pizza places in Plano for dining in. This was not only NOT a dine-in pizza place it was one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. The dough was tough and rubbery.  The sauce was scant and there was a different cheese not a traditional delicious mozzarella but something else that was just awful.  We had the vegetarian pizza. 

Ambiance was non existent. 

You placed your order through a kiosk sitting on a stand.  They still had the nerve to request a tip. Lol.

Review: Sauce bros is fantastic. My bf and I ordered takeout for the first time yesterday and both pizzas were great. Love the fusion concept. They do an amazing job of blending NY pizza with flavors from Bangladesh. We both love Indian food so this was a no brainer for us. Great job guys! Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the large beef pepperoni + jalapeños and large naga chicken in medium. 

I wish I took pics but we just devoured them. Crust was fantastic. Pepperoni was great and we loved that they have beef options as my bf is Muslim and doesn't eat pork. So that was really nice bc we never can get pepperoni anywhere. The naga chicken za was the real star imo. Medium had a decent kick to it so be aware they aren't playing if you don't like spice! It was perfect for us. Definitely check them out! They do have seating inside but it's warm so I think takeout is best! Will be back again next time we want pizza and try the harissa chicken!

Review: Half Spicy naga chicken pizza & pesto beef jhura, not pictured the hot honey cheese pizza. Every bite is filled with so much flavor! My favorite is the spicy naga chicken pizza, (if you look SPICY spicy this one is IT).

Review: Tried this on a whim for dinner! We ordered the Naga Habanero Chicken, medium spicy. We loved it! Was so delicious and flavorful. My husband is a big pizza fan and he enjoyed the crust and dough. He said it reminded him of Papa John's. I'd highly recommend! They have side dishes and pasta as well. The wings looked yummy too! The service was amazing- they offered complimentary drinks while we waited for our pizza and answered all our questions! Our wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad at all. It's small inside, so not a lot of room to eat, but they do have stools and two small tables. Definitely will be back!

Review: Thats a tasty pie!
The owner Red is a good dude- he was able to sneak me in front of a massive SuperBowl order so I was able to pick up a piping hot pizza in 15 minutes. 

Just added SauceBros to the top of my pizza list after polishing off a XL Spicy Naga Chicken. Probably the best pizza I have had in Plano. 

Super thin, perfect dough/crust and the flavor is a 10/10. 

Will be back soon to try some other toppings.

Review: Had the garlic ghee mushroom,  added onion and got a side of HOT HONEY! 
Thin crust, good ratio of ingredients. 

Pick up, not much dining area. Quick, on time, very friendly service. Nice gentlemen helped me select a great pizza, over the phone.

4 star pizza
5 star service

Prices were a little high but understandable,  as they offer halal meats. 

If you are a pizza lover and like interesting pizza choices, you'll love this little spot. Not your ordinary selections. 

Highly recommend.

Review: Taste was decent, but the portion to cost is way off. I e only ordered here once and they got the order wrong, the pizza was a pepperoni 14" for $20! Way over priced considering you can get a 16" at Taverna Rosa for $18 loaded.

Review: If you're looking for good pizza, but something different, then come here. They got cheese and meat lovers, but they also have interesting Indian/Middle Eastern topped pizzas, that once you try, will be a new favorite. The crust is also very good. You can tell by the bite and chew that they let this rise and proof for some time. They have a mural of Portnoy, who is infamous for eating and rating pizza. If I were him, I'd give this place a solid 86.9 on the scale. It's better than all the chain places, but it's not the best I've ever had. SauceBros' edge is being different than what you'd usually find and when I want something different I'll come here.

Review: Excited to try this place based on reviews and their menu offering some unique pies. This is definitely a take out spot -  small location, a counter and a few stools. The beef pepperoni was good, would love if more basil added. For the Spicy Nagy Chicken had requested cilantro on the side but that was missed. And there was a lot and it's a no go for my other half.  The owner offered to remake "them". I came back fifteen minutes later, they remade the Nagy but not the pepperoni. Ideal to have both fresh and ultimately just a miscommunication. He ended up refunding the order which I didn't think was necessary but was a kind gesture. I really liked the Spicy Nagy - the cilantro makes it!  They ask how spicy you want the habanero sauce on the Nagy. We chose most spicy but it was pretty tame. Wonder if we actually got the spiciest!  Great crust!!!  We look forward to trying additional items

Review: We were just looking for a random new pizza place and this one came up.

I was intrigued by the Indian fusion pizzas so we ordered a couple of those. When we got there, the owner and his wife greeted us and were some of the friendliest owners I've ever met! Their customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back!

For the pizza, we tried their garlic ghee mushroom pizza and their beer pesto pizza. Both were incredible flavor bombs! On top of that, their dough was just the perfect amount of crispy without being too chewy or cutting the roof of my mouth! Excited to go back and try more!

The owner is from NYC so he gets it--pizza is all about the sauce and the dough. The sauce here an the dough are amazing. I am from NYC so I know pizza as well and I'd highly recommend their pizza. I had the Naga chicken Pizza and Jhura beef. It was good so two days later we ordered it again. I eat halal meat only and this place has halal pizza with desi flavors. If you like spicy then this is the place! I just loved it. 

Also, the owner is a great guy. So hospitable. He gave us tons of recommendation for good Dallas  area restaurants.

Review: I tried this place because it had so many good reviews. Where I think I went wrong was ordering a cheese pizza like a build your own because I was craving pepperoni, mushroom, jalapeño pizza.SauceBros has a lot of specialty pizzas and I should have started off with one of those. My pizza was good, but I have had better. I wish there would have been more pepperonis and the jalapeños were very small. Also, I ordered via Grubhub which took 40 extra mins. My second mistake. By the time it got here, it was cold. I will have to try this place again, but will go there in person and try something that they are known for off their menu.

Review: Amazing thin crust pizzas with classic and unique flavors. Tried cheese with honey, naga chicken, pepperoni and naga mushroom. All 4 were absolutely mindblowingly delicious. Definitely coming back for more. I wish the owners would expand to downtown Dallas as a second location so I can get my fix more easily.

Review: After hearing about the pizza from here from multiple people I finally gave this place a shot. I definitely recommend it, as the pizza flavors are innovative and delicious. 8.5/10 for me. The vibes inside are that of a typical small pizza joint, and really added to the experience for me.

We got the Bongo Tex Mex with ranch on the side. The Alfredo sauce really tied everything together and the beef was juicy and delicious. The only complaint we had was there was a bit too much grease, which made it a bit soggy as the crust was also quite thin.

Review: I went here for the first time based upon the reviews.

I got the meat lovers and it was nothing special. I am not sure why this place is so popular. Price was also expensive as they don't have small sizes. They sell pizzas only in 14 and 16 inches. Also, if you order online, they charge you extra fees for that. Not sure who does that. 

I am not sure if I will go back again or not.

Review: I really wanted to like this place as the owners were so nice, but that's not the case. I ordered 2 pizzas recently (meat lovers and basic cheese) and they were so inedible that we each ate one piece and literally threw away over $50 worth of pizza. The crust was fine, but nothing special. The cheese pizza crust was burnt on the bottom. I don't mind a little char from the ovens, but this went beyond that.
Worst part is the lack of sauce. It was almost undetectable. You would think with the name "sauce" in their name that that wouldn't be an issue. Worst part was the cheese and toppings. The sausage and pepperoni tasted off and the meat lovers seemed burnt on the top. The cheese didn't taste like a typical pizza cheese either. I honestly don't know how you would mess up a pizza that bad, but none of us could stomach another slice.
Maybe it was just an off day for this place, but I am truly baffled by the great reviews. I also might have given them a little grace had the pizza not been so expensive as well as the nearly $5 in fees extra fees added to the online order through their website. I would not have tipped had I noticed the extra fees in the order already.

Review: Phenomenal NY-Style pizza!

Second time coming here and one of the best NY Style Pie's in the city! Added bonus that the Beef Pepperoni is halal and much tastier than what I've had at other places.

Sauce was slightly too sweet this time but it seems that it was a one-off issue, as it generally has been a hit in the past.

Review: I visited this place last week and I was pleasantly surprised! My older son wanted a pizza and he wanted something different from the typical cheese and pepperoni pizza flavors. I searched Yelp and found this place and I am glad I did. We ordered the Shrimp Naga pizza and the Chicken Naga pizza. The guy who took my order over the phone was very friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us when we asked to have spicy sauce on the side for the spicy lovers in our group. He even walked the pizza out to our car when we arrived to pick it up. He told us more about the pizza and how he came up with the toppings for the two pizzas. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure.  

Nevertheless the pizzas were hot and delicious! The Naga sauce is very tasty, was sweet, spicy, and tangy, truly amazing! It's definitely a must try. The only thing I would change would be to add red onions to the Spicy Naga Chicken, I will add it as a topping next time bc it compliments the flavor profile so well. Unfortunately, my kids dug in as soon as I drove off so I don't have any pictures to share! I will definitely get some on the next visit. I'd love to have this place in my neighborhood!

Review: Decided to check out this place after seeing all the rave reviews and photos. Was not disappointed! The ordering process was quick and easy, and the pizza was ready within 10-15 minutes. The owners said every meat item on their menu is hand slaughtered halal, so that's an extra plus. Since we couldn't decide which specialty pizza to try first, we decided to do an X-Large (16-in) half and half with 1/2 Spicy Chicken Naga and 1/2 Meat Lovers.

The Spicy Naga Chicken Pizza tastes like a really good butter chicken pizza but with a little extra kick to it, and the Meat Lovers pizza is also packed with flavor in every bite and theres a generous amount of meat spread throughout! For as much meat and sauce as there was in the pizza, fortunately it wasn't too greasy and you won't end up feeling bloated or like you're having a GERD episode afterwards.

If you enjoy a NY thin crust style pizza or lots of flavor, this place will be right up your alley. If you're a "pizza snob" who watches the One Bite pizza reviews, there's a great amount of flavor and crisp in each bite, and I'd recommend waiting a few minutes before digging in so that you experience a stronger undercarriage and less flop with all the sauces and toppings these pizzas hold.

Had a chance to speak with one of the owners as well, and they were super generous and you can tell that these dudes are super passionate about their pizza! Definitely plan on coming back here often to try out their other specialty pizzas.

Review: Great pizza! The Naga sauce is actually spicy! And the garlic ghee mushroom hits the spot!
The texture of the dough is a little stiff, however the flavor of it is comparable to sourdough. They are really friendly when you pick up and the pizzas are ready pretty fast! 
Definitely worth the try, and if you have to... the drive!

Review: After reading it was one of the best Pizzas 2023 we decided to visit.  I had searched for the top pizza places in Plano for dining in. This was not only NOT a dine-in pizza place it was one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. The dough was tough and rubbery.  The sauce was scant and there was a different cheese not a traditional delicious mozzarella but something else that was just awful.  We had the vegetarian pizza. 

Ambiance was non existent. 

You placed your order through a kiosk sitting on a stand.  They still had the nerve to request a tip. Lol.

Review: Sauce bros is fantastic. My bf and I ordered takeout for the first time yesterday and both pizzas were great. Love the fusion concept. They do an amazing job of blending NY pizza with flavors from Bangladesh. We both love Indian food so this was a no brainer for us. Great job guys! Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the large beef pepperoni + jalapeños and large naga chicken in medium. 

I wish I took pics but we just devoured them. Crust was fantastic. Pepperoni was great and we loved that they have beef options as my bf is Muslim and doesn't eat pork. So that was really nice bc we never can get pepperoni anywhere. The naga chicken za was the real star imo. Medium had a decent kick to it so be aware they aren't playing if you don't like spice! It was perfect for us. Definitely check them out! They do have seating inside but it's warm so I think takeout is best! Will be back again next time we want pizza and try the harissa chicken!

Review: Half Spicy naga chicken pizza & pesto beef jhura, not pictured the hot honey cheese pizza. Every bite is filled with so much flavor! My favorite is the spicy naga chicken pizza, (if you look SPICY spicy this one is IT).

Review: Tried this on a whim for dinner! We ordered the Naga Habanero Chicken, medium spicy. We loved it! Was so delicious and flavorful. My husband is a big pizza fan and he enjoyed the crust and dough. He said it reminded him of Papa John's. I'd highly recommend! They have side dishes and pasta as well. The wings looked yummy too! The service was amazing- they offered complimentary drinks while we waited for our pizza and answered all our questions! Our wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad at all. It's small inside, so not a lot of room to eat, but they do have stools and two small tables. Definitely will be back!

Review: Thats a tasty pie!
The owner Red is a good dude- he was able to sneak me in front of a massive SuperBowl order so I was able to pick up a piping hot pizza in 15 minutes. 

Just added SauceBros to the top of my pizza list after polishing off a XL Spicy Naga Chicken. Probably the best pizza I have had in Plano. 

Super thin, perfect dough/crust and the flavor is a 10/10. 

Will be back soon to try some other toppings.

Review: Had the garlic ghee mushroom,  added onion and got a side of HOT HONEY! 
Thin crust, good ratio of ingredients. 

Pick up, not much dining area. Quick, on time, very friendly service. Nice gentlemen helped me select a great pizza, over the phone.

4 star pizza
5 star service

Prices were a little high but understandable,  as they offer halal meats. 

If you are a pizza lover and like interesting pizza choices, you'll love this little spot. Not your ordinary selections. 

Highly recommend.

Review: Taste was decent, but the portion to cost is way off. I e only ordered here once and they got the order wrong, the pizza was a pepperoni 14" for $20! Way over priced considering you can get a 16" at Taverna Rosa for $18 loaded.

Review: If you're looking for good pizza, but something different, then come here. They got cheese and meat lovers, but they also have interesting Indian/Middle Eastern topped pizzas, that once you try, will be a new favorite. The crust is also very good. You can tell by the bite and chew that they let this rise and proof for some time. They have a mural of Portnoy, who is infamous for eating and rating pizza. If I were him, I'd give this place a solid 86.9 on the scale. It's better than all the chain places, but it's not the best I've ever had. SauceBros' edge is being different than what you'd usually find and when I want something different I'll come here.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Excited to try this place based on reviews and their menu offering some unique pies. This is definitely a take out spot -  small location, a counter and a few stools. The beef pepperoni was good, would love if more basil added. For the Spicy Nagy Chicken had requested cilantro on the side but that was missed. And there was a lot and it's a no go for my other half.  The owner offered to remake "them". I came back fifteen minutes later, they remade the Nagy but not the pepperoni. Ideal to have both fresh and ultimately just a miscommunication. He ended up refunding the order which I didn't think was necessary but was a kind gesture. I really liked the Spicy Nagy - the cilantro makes it!  They ask how spicy you want the habanero sauce on the Nagy. We chose most spicy but it was pretty tame. Wonder if we actually got the spiciest!  Great crust!!!  We look forward to trying additional items

Review: We were just looking for a random new pizza place and this one came up.

I was intrigued by the Indian fusion pizzas so we ordered a couple of those. When we got there, the owner and his wife greeted us and were some of the friendliest owners I've ever met! Their customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back!

For the pizza, we tried their garlic ghee mushroom pizza and their beer pesto pizza. Both were incredible flavor bombs! On top of that, their dough was just the perfect amount of crispy without being too chewy or cutting the roof of my mouth! Excited to go back and try more!

Review: We are here for my husband's work and have had some mediocre and EXPENSIVE food around the Plano area. We found this gem driving around and I am SO glad we did! Amazing pizza, perfect amount of cheese, sauce and meat. You can tell the veggies were fresh! The employees were so nice and accommodating! Very clean establishment and the prices were great compared to other places. We will definitely dine here again, before heading back home! The owner Red was very nice and kept the little one busy while mom and dad ate. Thank you for a great experience!

Review: Super yummy pizza! Owners were kind and brought the pizza out to my car which was great on this pregnant ladies swollen feet. Ordered the chicken Bianca and it was ready in about 12 mins, loved that. The guys offered me a free drink while I waited which was so thoughtful on a 109 degree day. The sauce was great but the crust was really the stand out feature! It's hard to get me to cheat on Zalat but Sauce Bros actually has me excited to try them again and more of their flavors!! 5/5 stars!

Review: If I could give it any higher stars then I would. This place is awesome! Full of flavors. We were visiting Dallas and found this gem. 

The owner is from NYC so he gets it--pizza is all about the sauce and the dough. The sauce here an the dough are amazing. I am from NYC so I know pizza as well and I'd highly recommend their pizza. I had the Naga chicken Pizza and Jhura beef. It was good so two days later we ordered it again. I eat halal meat only and this place has halal pizza with desi flavors. If you like spicy then this is the place! I just loved it. 

Also, the owner is a great guy. So hospitable. He gave us tons of recommendation for good Dallas  area restaurants.

Review: Just moved to Dallas last month and we've been on the hunt for the best halal pizza spot. Tried SauceBros for the first time tonight and they did not disappoint!

Review: At first I was a little skeptical about SauceBros because there's a million pizzerias nearby so why go to one in Plano? The search for great pizza of course. Ryan said he had already done the homework and Frisco was out of good pizza places. Trust. 

This place is literally hole in the wall. There is no restroom nor a whole lot of place to sit. In fact I literally questioned Ryan on whether or not we'd actually get a seat here at this place on a Sunday night. My fears were eased when we rolled in and scored the seats by the window. 

We ordered an naga habanero half chicken and half beef bengali beef pesto pizza using their kiosk. I also wised up and ordered a side of garlic for dipping and hot honey right on the pizza itself. A fantastic combination I might add. *Pats self on the back*. They use the super Costco pizza ovens so several can go in at once.

It's probably better to order ahead of time instead of sitting around and waiting (they do doordash/phone/online orders too). There were several people that came in to pick up their to-go orders. I wouldn't dine-in here unless you have no other place to eat your pizza. Their beverage selection was pricey and was also a little lackluster so don't count on them having what you want.

Review: This pizza is FIRE. The pizza is fantastic -- get the Harissa Chicken, the Korean BBQ Beef, and the 4 Cheese W/ Honey. I get my extra crispy and it comes out perfect! Great service, quick and easy for Takeout (they only have a couple seats to eat in). The staff is very kind!

Rating: 4 stars
Review: A solid place to try out if you want to try unique pizza flavors! This place is an Indian-style pizza place that has unique fusions. The store is really really small so I recommend ordering ahead for takeout if you're going with friends. The service was great and the staff were friendly. I preferred the beef taco pizza flavor over the Naga habanero chicken but both were definitely unique. The chicken Alfredo was pretty good with the flavor that you would expect. I would recommend to come try it out at least once and see how yuh like it!

Review: We ordered one each of the  Meat Lovers and BBQ Korean pizzas and each one tasted exactly the same.  This place was overhyped by Dallas Morning News and left us $80 poorer. Who spends $80 for pizza??? Definitely not us again.

Waay too much BBQ sauce which took away from the taste of the actual pizza itself. When one orders a pizza, one expects a tomato or white sauce, not BBQ sauce as the main ingredient. The sauce made the pizza almost sickeningly sweet and we had to throw over half of it away. Will never order from this place again.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I have been waiting to try this place for so long, but they're closed on Mondays when I'm usually free. Finally hit them up on another weekday evening and it was fire! I called ahead 15 mins to place a take out order. The interior is veryyy small so I'd suggest you order for take out. They allow you to do 2 different flavors on a pizza so we tried the Korean Bbq and the naga habanero chicken. I loved that they ask how spicy you want the naga habanero to be and it's legit spicy so beware! The Korean bbq imo just tasted like American bbq sauce but it was still good. My favorite was the naga habanero. I would come back and order the naga plus a new flavor to try!

Review: I am picky when it comes to pizza and that's because I have tried a lot! This is hands down the best pizza I have had in DFW. I recently moved to Plano and found them on UberEats. AMAZING. I've order at least 10 times now in the past few months. If you love a rich sweet red wine sauce, this is the pizza place for you. My only complaint is not being able to order on UberEats until after 3 pm but it's probably because they're so busy making that sauce with love that it takes a little more time. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Review: I was so excited to find out about this place and my first pizza which was simply the beef pepperoni and cheese was great! I have to admit in full disclosure that I am a very picky pizza eater being from the NYC area originally. I love a thin crispy crust and have always been a fan of beef pepperoni on a pizza. We were so excited, we thought finally we have found a great pizza place! Unfortunately, the next two pizzas that I ordered were totally different from the first one that I received. Exact same order other than I added additional beef pepperoni. But on the second two, the crust wasn't crispy and it was hard to believe that these had come from the same place that I had gotten the same pizza from just a week earlier. It was just OK and for the price I paid for six slices of pizza and the large size. I know that unfortunately I will still be looking for a great thin crispy crust pizza. My hopes were high, but unfortunately, the consistency was not there. With the number of people in West Plano that are from the east coast it seems unbelievable that we can't get great pizza in this area.

Review: This isn't your typical pizza place. They have mostly exotic style pizza. Way too expensive imo. We got the traditional pepperoni, which was good for $10. Unfortunately, they charge $17. No way! We also got a weird specialty pizza and it wasn't even edible. The owner was very nice and even gave us a free pizza, knowing the one we got was a required taste. So he recommended the taco pizza. At first bite, it reminded me nothing of a taco but the ingredients were similar. It was spicy /5/10 and pretty tasty. But again, $23, way too expensive and not even for their largest pizza

 WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR: unique flavored pizzas. It's NYC style pizza with a Bangladeshi fusion, I didn't know what to choose!
 THE VIBE: just a quick grab & go place!
 PRICE: ~$20 (I can't remember but it was great pricing) 
 WOULD I COME BACK? Yes!

Overall Rating: 10/10 
- I have become a huge pizza fan after discovering @saucebrosusa  and their employee is the sweetest!
- This pizza is PACKED with AUTHENTIC flavor you cannot find anywhere else especially on a pizza! I was so surprised the beef taco side tasted like authentic Mexican street tacos especially with that spicy green sauce. 
- The nago habanero line (they have chicken, paneer, etc) is basically Desi food on top of pizza and it is actually the best combination ever. The spice level is top tier 
- I cannot wait to go back and order more of their flavors!

Review: Damn that Naga Chicken Pizza is sooo yummm!! Yes, it's spicy hence the mild version but it was delicious! Great NY style pizza, with a tasty crust and the ingredients all tasted super fresh. The owner is super friendly and really cares about making sure customers are happy with his pizza. 

Can't wait to try the other pizzas! I'll be back soon!

Review: I had a truly amazing experience with SauceBros -- while they didn't quite have what I was originally looking for, the pizza I ended up with was delicious and packed with flavor.

Aside from a fantastic flavor profile on their pizza, the staff (especially the owner) went above and beyond to make my order and my visit successful. It's  not often that you get treated to such great hospitality.

Looking forward to my next experience!

The sauce was scant and there was a different cheese not a traditional delicious mozzarella but something else that was just awful.  We had the vegetarian pizza. 

Ambiance was non existent. 

You placed your order through a kiosk sitting on a stand.  They still had the nerve to request a tip. Lol.

Review: Sauce bros is fantastic. My bf and I ordered takeout for the first time yesterday and both pizzas were great. Love the fusion concept. They do an amazing job of blending NY pizza with flavors from Bangladesh. We both love Indian food so this was a no brainer for us. Great job guys! Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the large beef pepperoni + jalapeños and large naga chicken in medium. 

I wish I took pics but we just devoured them. Crust was fantastic. Pepperoni was great and we loved that they have beef options as my bf is Muslim and doesn't eat pork. So that was really nice bc we never can get pepperoni anywhere. The naga chicken za was the real star imo. Medium had a decent kick to it so be aware they aren't playing if you don't like spice! It was perfect for us. Definitely check them out! They do have seating inside but it's warm so I think takeout is best! Will be back again next time we want pizza and try the harissa chicken!

Review: Half Spicy naga chicken pizza & pesto beef jhura, not pictured the hot honey cheese pizza. Every bite is filled with so much flavor! My favorite is the spicy naga chicken pizza, (if you look SPICY spicy this one is IT).

Review: Tried this on a whim for dinner! We ordered the Naga Habanero Chicken, medium spicy. We loved it! Was so delicious and flavorful. My husband is a big pizza fan and he enjoyed the crust and dough. He said it reminded him of Papa John's. I'd highly recommend! They have side dishes and pasta as well. The wings looked yummy too! The service was amazing- they offered complimentary drinks while we waited for our pizza and answered all our questions! Our wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad at all. It's small inside, so not a lot of room to eat, but they do have stools and two small tables. Definitely will be back!

Review: Thats a tasty pie!
The owner Red is a good dude- he was able to sneak me in front of a massive SuperBowl order so I was able to pick up a piping hot pizza in 15 minutes. 

Just added SauceBros to the top of my pizza list after polishing off a XL Spicy Naga Chicken. Probably the best pizza I have had in Plano. 

Super thin, perfect dough/crust and the flavor is a 10/10. 

Will be back soon to try some other toppings.

Review: If you're looking for good pizza, but something different, then come here. They got cheese and meat lovers, but they also have interesting Indian/Middle Eastern topped pizzas, that once you try, will be a new favorite. The crust is also very good. You can tell by the bite and chew that they let this rise and proof for some time. They have a mural of Portnoy, who is infamous for eating and rating pizza. If I were him, I'd give this place a solid 86.9 on the scale. It's better than all the chain places, but it's not the best I've ever had. SauceBros' edge is being different than what you'd usually find and when I want something different I'll come here.

Review: Excited to try this place based on reviews and their menu offering some unique pies. This is definitely a take out spot -  small location, a counter and a few stools. The beef pepperoni was good, would love if more basil added. For the Spicy Nagy Chicken had requested cilantro on the side but that was missed. And there was a lot and it's a no go for my other half.  The owner offered to remake "them". I came back fifteen minutes later, they remade the Nagy but not the pepperoni. Ideal to have both fresh and ultimately just a miscommunication. He ended up refunding the order which I didn't think was necessary but was a kind gesture. I really liked the Spicy Nagy - the cilantro makes it!  They ask how spicy you want the habanero sauce on the Nagy. We chose most spicy but it was pretty tame. Wonder if we actually got the spiciest!  Great crust!!!  We look forward to trying additional items

Review: We were just looking for a random new pizza place and this one came up.

I was intrigued by the Indian fusion pizzas so we ordered a couple of those. When we got there, the owner and his wife greeted us and were some of the friendliest owners I've ever met! Their customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back!

For the pizza, we tried their garlic ghee mushroom pizza and their beer pesto pizza. Both were incredible flavor bombs! On top of that, their dough was just the perfect amount of crispy without being too chewy or cutting the roof of my mouth! Excited to go back and try more!

Review: We are here for my husband's work and have had some mediocre and EXPENSIVE food around the Plano area. We found this gem driving around and I am SO glad we did! Amazing pizza, perfect amount of cheese, sauce and meat. You can tell the veggies were fresh! The employees were so nice and accommodating! Very clean establishment and the prices were great compared to other places. We will definitely dine here again, before heading back home! The owner Red was very nice and kept the little one busy while mom and dad ate. Thank you for a great experience!

Review: Super yummy pizza! Owners were kind and brought the pizza out to my car which was great on this pregnant ladies swollen feet. Ordered the chicken Bianca and it was ready in about 12 mins, loved that. The guys offered me a free drink while I waited which was so thoughtful on a 109 degree day. The sauce was great but the crust was really the stand out feature! It's hard to get me to cheat on Zalat but Sauce Bros actually has me excited to try them again and more of their flavors!! 5/5 stars!

Review: If I could give it any higher stars then I would. This place is awesome! Full of flavors. We were visiting Dallas and found this gem. 

The owner is from NYC so he gets it--pizza is all about the sauce and the dough. The sauce here an the dough are amazing. I am from NYC so I know pizza as well and I'd highly recommend their pizza. I had the Naga chicken Pizza and Jhura beef. It was good so two days later we ordered it again. I eat halal meat only and this place has halal pizza with desi flavors. If you like spicy then this is the place! I just loved it. 

Also, the owner is a great guy. So hospitable. He gave us tons of recommendation for good Dallas  area restaurants.

Review: Just moved to Dallas last month and we've been on the hunt for the best halal pizza spot. Tried SauceBros for the first time tonight and they did not disappoint!

Review: At first I was a little skeptical about SauceBros because there's a million pizzerias nearby so why go to one in Plano? The search for great pizza of course. Ryan said he had already done the homework and Frisco was out of good pizza places. Trust. 

This place is literally hole in the wall. There is no restroom nor a whole lot of place to sit. In fact I literally questioned Ryan on whether or not we'd actually get a seat here at this place on a Sunday night. My fears were eased when we rolled in and scored the seats by the window. 

We ordered an naga habanero half chicken and half beef bengali beef pesto pizza using their kiosk. I also wised up and ordered a side of garlic for dipping and hot honey right on the pizza itself. A fantastic combination I might add. *Pats self on the back*. They use the super Costco pizza ovens so several can go in at once.

It's probably better to order ahead of time instead of sitting around and waiting (they do doordash/phone/online orders too). There were several people that came in to pick up their to-go orders. I wouldn't dine-in here unless you have no other place to eat your pizza. Their beverage selection was pricey and was also a little lackluster so don't count on them having what you want.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: This pizza is FIRE. The pizza is fantastic -- get the Harissa Chicken, the Korean BBQ Beef, and the 4 Cheese W/ Honey. I get my extra crispy and it comes out perfect! Great service, quick and easy for Takeout (they only have a couple seats to eat in). The staff is very kind!

Rating: 4 stars
Review: A solid place to try out if you want to try unique pizza flavors! This place is an Indian-style pizza place that has unique fusions. The store is really really small so I recommend ordering ahead for takeout if you're going with friends. The service was great and the staff were friendly. I preferred the beef taco pizza flavor over the Naga habanero chicken but both were definitely unique. The chicken Alfredo was pretty good with the flavor that you would expect. I would recommend to come try it out at least once and see how yuh like it!

Rating: 1 stars
Review: We ordered one each of the  Meat Lovers and BBQ Korean pizzas and each one tasted exactly the same.  This place was overhyped by Dallas Morning News and left us $80 poorer. Who spends $80 for pizza??? Definitely not us again.

Waay too much BBQ sauce which took away from the taste of the actual pizza itself. When one orders a pizza, one expects a tomato or white sauce, not BBQ sauce as the main ingredient. The sauce made the pizza almost sickeningly sweet and we had to throw over half of it away. Will never order from this place again.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I have been waiting to try this place for so long, but they're closed on Mondays when I'm usually free. Finally hit them up on another weekday evening and it was fire! I called ahead 15 mins to place a take out order. The interior is veryyy small so I'd suggest you order for take out. They allow you to do 2 different flavors on a pizza so we tried the Korean Bbq and the naga habanero chicken. I loved that they ask how spicy you want the naga habanero to be and it's legit spicy so beware! The Korean bbq imo just tasted like American bbq sauce but it was still good. My favorite was the naga habanero. I would come back and order the naga plus a new flavor to try!

Review: I am picky when it comes to pizza and that's because I have tried a lot! This is hands down the best pizza I have had in DFW. I recently moved to Plano and found them on UberEats. AMAZING. I've order at least 10 times now in the past few months. If you love a rich sweet red wine sauce, this is the pizza place for you. My only complaint is not being able to order on UberEats until after 3 pm but it's probably because they're so busy making that sauce with love that it takes a little more time. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: I was so excited to find out about this place and my first pizza which was simply the beef pepperoni and cheese was great! I have to admit in full disclosure that I am a very picky pizza eater being from the NYC area originally. I love a thin crispy crust and have always been a fan of beef pepperoni on a pizza. We were so excited, we thought finally we have found a great pizza place! Unfortunately, the next two pizzas that I ordered were totally different from the first one that I received. Exact same order other than I added additional beef pepperoni. But on the second two, the crust wasn't crispy and it was hard to believe that these had come from the same place that I had gotten the same pizza from just a week earlier. It was just OK and for the price I paid for six slices of pizza and the large size. I know that unfortunately I will still be looking for a great thin crispy crust pizza. My hopes were high, but unfortunately, the consistency was not there. With the number of people in West Plano that are from the east coast it seems unbelievable that we can't get great pizza in this area.

Review: This isn't your typical pizza place. They have mostly exotic style pizza. Way too expensive imo. We got the traditional pepperoni, which was good for $10. Unfortunately, they charge $17. No way! We also got a weird specialty pizza and it wasn't even edible. The owner was very nice and even gave us a free pizza, knowing the one we got was a required taste. So he recommended the taco pizza. At first bite, it reminded me nothing of a taco but the ingredients were similar. It was spicy /5/10 and pretty tasty. But again, $23, way too expensive and not even for their largest pizza

 WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR: unique flavored pizzas. It's NYC style pizza with a Bangladeshi fusion, I didn't know what to choose!
 THE VIBE: just a quick grab & go place!
 PRICE: ~$20 (I can't remember but it was great pricing) 
 WOULD I COME BACK? Yes!

Overall Rating: 10/10 
- I have become a huge pizza fan after discovering @saucebrosusa  and their employee is the sweetest!
- This pizza is PACKED with AUTHENTIC flavor you cannot find anywhere else especially on a pizza! I was so surprised the beef taco side tasted like authentic Mexican street tacos especially with that spicy green sauce. 
- The nago habanero line (they have chicken, paneer, etc) is basically Desi food on top of pizza and it is actually the best combination ever. The spice level is top tier 
- I cannot wait to go back and order more of their flavors!

Review: Damn that Naga Chicken Pizza is sooo yummm!! Yes, it's spicy hence the mild version but it was delicious! Great NY style pizza, with a tasty crust and the ingredients all tasted super fresh. The owner is super friendly and really cares about making sure customers are happy with his pizza. 

Can't wait to try the other pizzas! I'll be back soon!

Review: I had a truly amazing experience with SauceBros -- while they didn't quite have what I was originally looking for, the pizza I ended up with was delicious and packed with flavor.

Aside from a fantastic flavor profile on their pizza, the staff (especially the owner) went above and beyond to make my order and my visit successful. It's  not often that you get treated to such great hospitality.

Looking forward to my next experience!

Review: I tried this place because it had so many good reviews. Where I think I went wrong was ordering a cheese pizza like a build your own because I was craving pepperoni, mushroom, jalapeño pizza.SauceBros has a lot of specialty pizzas and I should have started off with one of those. My pizza was good, but I have had better. I wish there would have been more pepperonis and the jalapeños were very small. Also, I ordered via Grubhub which took 40 extra mins. My second mistake. By the time it got here, it was cold. I will have to try this place again, but will go there in person and try something that they are known for off their menu.

Review: Amazing thin crust pizzas with classic and unique flavors. Tried cheese with honey, naga chicken, pepperoni and naga mushroom. All 4 were absolutely mindblowingly delicious. Definitely coming back for more. I wish the owners would expand to downtown Dallas as a second location so I can get my fix more easily.

Review: After hearing about the pizza from here from multiple people I finally gave this place a shot. I definitely recommend it, as the pizza flavors are innovative and delicious. 8.5/10 for me. The vibes inside are that of a typical small pizza joint, and really added to the experience for me.
----
We got the Bongo Tex Mex with ranch on the side. The Alfredo sauce really tied everything together and the beef was juicy and delicious. The only complaint we had was there was a bit too much grease, which made it a bit soggy as the crust was also quite thin.

Rating: 2 stars
Review: I went here for the first time based upon the reviews.

I got the meat lovers and it was nothing special. I am not sure why this place is so popular. Price was also expensive as they don't have small sizes. They sell pizzas only in 14 and 16 inches. Also, if you order online, they charge you extra fees for that. Not sure who does that. 

I am not sure if I will go back again or not.

Review: I really wanted to like this place as the owners were so nice, but that's not the case. I ordered 2 pizzas recently (meat lovers and basic cheese) and they were so inedible that we each ate one piece and literally threw away over $50 worth of pizza. The crust was fine, but nothing special. The cheese pizza crust was burnt on the bottom. I don't mind a little char from the ovens, but this went beyond that.
Worst part is the lack of sauce. It was almost undetectable. You would think with the name "sauce" in their name that that wouldn't be an issue. Worst part was the cheese and toppings. The sausage and pepperoni tasted off and the meat lovers seemed burnt on the top. The cheese didn't taste like a typical pizza cheese either. I honestly don't know how you would mess up a pizza that bad, but none of us could stomach another slice.
Maybe it was just an off day for this place, but I am truly baffled by the great reviews. I also might have given them a little grace had the pizza not been so expensive as well as the nearly $5 in fees extra fees added to the online order through their website. I would not have tipped had I noticed the extra fees in the order already.

Second time coming here and one of the best NY Style Pie's in the city! Added bonus that the Beef Pepperoni is halal and much tastier than what I've had at other places.

Sauce was slightly too sweet this time but it seems that it was a one-off issue, as it generally has been a hit in the past.

Review: I visited this place last week and I was pleasantly surprised! My older son wanted a pizza and he wanted something different from the typical cheese and pepperoni pizza flavors. I searched Yelp and found this place and I am glad I did. We ordered the Shrimp Naga pizza and the Chicken Naga pizza. The guy who took my order over the phone was very friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us when we asked to have spicy sauce on the side for the spicy lovers in our group. He even walked the pizza out to our car when we arrived to pick it up. He told us more about the pizza and how he came up with the toppings for the two pizzas. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure.  

Nevertheless the pizzas were hot and delicious! The Naga sauce is very tasty, was sweet, spicy, and tangy, truly amazing! It's definitely a must try. The only thing I would change would be to add red onions to the Spicy Naga Chicken, I will add it as a topping next time bc it compliments the flavor profile so well. Unfortunately, my kids dug in as soon as I drove off so I don't have any pictures to share! I will definitely get some on the next visit. I'd love to have this place in my neighborhood!

Review: Decided to check out this place after seeing all the rave reviews and photos. Was not disappointed! The ordering process was quick and easy, and the pizza was ready within 10-15 minutes. The owners said every meat item on their menu is hand slaughtered halal, so that's an extra plus. Since we couldn't decide which specialty pizza to try first, we decided to do an X-Large (16-in) half and half with 1/2 Spicy Chicken Naga and 1/2 Meat Lovers.

The Spicy Naga Chicken Pizza tastes like a really good butter chicken pizza but with a little extra kick to it, and the Meat Lovers pizza is also packed with flavor in every bite and theres a generous amount of meat spread throughout! For as much meat and sauce as there was in the pizza, fortunately it wasn't too greasy and you won't end up feeling bloated or like you're having a GERD episode afterwards.

If you enjoy a NY thin crust style pizza or lots of flavor, this place will be right up your alley. If you're a "pizza snob" who watches the One Bite pizza reviews, there's a great amount of flavor and crisp in each bite, and I'd recommend waiting a few minutes before digging in so that you experience a stronger undercarriage and less flop with all the sauces and toppings these pizzas hold.

Had a chance to speak with one of the owners as well, and they were super generous and you can tell that these dudes are super passionate about their pizza! Definitely plan on coming back here often to try out their other specialty pizzas.

Review: Recently tried this place for the first time. The owner  (I believe he was the owner) was very welcoming and helpful, he walked us thru the menu and provided more info and recommendations. The garlic ghee mushroom was my favorite, a lot of great flavor. Unfortunately the cheese pizza was underwhelming. I was expecting a classic cheese pizza but it was more like a margarita pizza.

Review: Great pizza! The Naga sauce is actually spicy! And the garlic ghee mushroom hits the spot!
The texture of the dough is a little stiff, however the flavor of it is comparable to sourdough. They are really friendly when you pick up and the pizzas are ready pretty fast! 
Definitely worth the try, and if you have to... the drive!

Review: We are here for my husband's work and have had some mediocre and EXPENSIVE food around the Plano area. We found this gem driving around and I am SO glad we did! Amazing pizza, perfect amount of cheese, sauce and meat. You can tell the veggies were fresh! The employees were so nice and accommodating! Very clean establishment and the prices were great compared to other places. We will definitely dine here again, before heading back home! The owner Red was very nice and kept the little one busy while mom and dad ate. Thank you for a great experience!

Review: Super yummy pizza! Owners were kind and brought the pizza out to my car which was great on this pregnant ladies swollen feet. Ordered the chicken Bianca and it was ready in about 12 mins, loved that. The guys offered me a free drink while I waited which was so thoughtful on a 109 degree day. The sauce was great but the crust was really the stand out feature! It's hard to get me to cheat on Zalat but Sauce Bros actually has me excited to try them again and more of their flavors!! 5/5 stars!

Review: If I could give it any higher stars then I would. This place is awesome! Full of flavors. We were visiting Dallas and found this gem. 

The owner is from NYC so he gets it--pizza is all about the sauce and the dough. The sauce here an the dough are amazing. I am from NYC so I know pizza as well and I'd highly recommend their pizza. I had the Naga chicken Pizza and Jhura beef. It was good so two days later we ordered it again. I eat halal meat only and this place has halal pizza with desi flavors. If you like spicy then this is the place! I just loved it. 

Also, the owner is a great guy. So hospitable. He gave us tons of recommendation for good Dallas  area restaurants.

Review: Just moved to Dallas last month and we've been on the hunt for the best halal pizza spot. Tried SauceBros for the first time tonight and they did not disappoint! The price for the pizza was def worth it and their flavors were 10/10! The 4 cheese with hot honey was bombbb! Can't wait to go back to try their wings and pasta!

Review: At first I was a little skeptical about SauceBros because there's a million pizzerias nearby so why go to one in Plano? The search for great pizza of course. Ryan said he had already done the homework and Frisco was out of good pizza places. Trust. 

This place is literally hole in the wall. There is no restroom nor a whole lot of place to sit. In fact I literally questioned Ryan on whether or not we'd actually get a seat here at this place on a Sunday night. My fears were eased when we rolled in and scored the seats by the window. 

We ordered an naga habanero half chicken and half beef bengali beef pesto pizza using their kiosk. I also wised up and ordered a side of garlic for dipping and hot honey right on the pizza itself. A fantastic combination I might add. *Pats self on the back*. They use the super Costco pizza ovens so several can go in at once.

It's probably better to order ahead of time instead of sitting around and waiting (they do doordash/phone/online orders too). There were several people that came in to pick up their to-go orders. I wouldn't dine-in here unless you have no other place to eat your pizza. Their beverage selection was pricey and was also a little lackluster so don't count on them having what you want.

Review: This pizza is FIRE. The pizza is fantastic -- get the Harissa Chicken, the Korean BBQ Beef, and the 4 Cheese W/ Honey. I get my extra crispy and it comes out perfect! Great service, quick and easy for Takeout (they only have a couple seats to eat in). The staff is very kind!

Review: A solid place to try out if you want to try unique pizza flavors! This place is an Indian-style pizza place that has unique fusions. The store is really really small so I recommend ordering ahead for takeout if you're going with friends. The service was great and the staff were friendly. I preferred the beef taco pizza flavor over the Naga habanero chicken but both were definitely unique. The chicken Alfredo was pretty good with the flavor that you would expect. I would recommend to come try it out at least once and see how yuh like it!

Review: We ordered one each of the  Meat Lovers and BBQ Korean pizzas and each one tasted exactly the same.  This place was overhyped by Dallas Morning News and left us $80 poorer. Who spends $80 for pizza??? Definitely not us again.

Waay too much BBQ sauce which took away from the taste of the actual pizza itself. When one orders a pizza, one expects a tomato or white sauce, not BBQ sauce as the main ingredient. The sauce made the pizza almost sickeningly sweet and we had to throw over half of it away. Will never order from this place again.

Review: I have been waiting to try this place for so long, but they're closed on Mondays when I'm usually free. Finally hit them up on another weekday evening and it was fire! I called ahead 15 mins to place a take out order. The interior is veryyy small so I'd suggest you order for take out. They allow you to do 2 different flavors on a pizza so we tried the Korean Bbq and the naga habanero chicken. I loved that they ask how spicy you want the naga habanero to be and it's legit spicy so beware! The Korean bbq imo just tasted like American bbq sauce but it was still good. My favorite was the naga habanero. I would come back and order the naga plus a new flavor to try!

Review: I am picky when it comes to pizza and that's because I have tried a lot! This is hands down the best pizza I have had in DFW. I recently moved to Plano and found them on UberEats. AMAZING. I've order at least 10 times now in the past few months. If you love a rich sweet red wine sauce, this is the pizza place for you. My only complaint is not being able to order on UberEats until after 3 pm but it's probably because they're so busy making that sauce with love that it takes a little more time. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Review: I was so excited to find out about this place and my first pizza which was simply the beef pepperoni and cheese was great! I have to admit in full disclosure that I am a very picky pizza eater being from the NYC area originally. I love a thin crispy crust and have always been a fan of beef pepperoni on a pizza. We were so excited, we thought finally we have found a great pizza place! Unfortunately, the next two pizzas that I ordered were totally different from the first one that I received. Exact same order other than I added additional beef pepperoni. But on the second two, the crust wasn't crispy and it was hard to believe that these had come from the same place that I had gotten the same pizza from just a week earlier. It was just OK and for the price I paid for six slices of pizza and the large size. I know that unfortunately I will still be looking for a great thin crispy crust pizza. My hopes were high, but unfortunately, the consistency was not there. With the number of people in West Plano that are from the east coast it seems unbelievable that we can't get great pizza in this area.

Review: This isn't your typical pizza place. They have mostly exotic style pizza. Way too expensive imo. We got the traditional pepperoni, which was good for $10. Unfortunately, they charge $17. No way! We also got a weird specialty pizza and it wasn't even edible. The owner was very nice and even gave us a free pizza, knowing the one we got was a required taste. So he recommended the taco pizza. At first bite, it reminded me nothing of a taco but the ingredients were similar. It was spicy /5/10 and pretty tasty. But again, $23, way too expensive and not even for their largest pizza

 WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR: unique flavored pizzas. It's NYC style pizza with a Bangladeshi fusion, I didn't know what to choose!
 THE VIBE: just a quick grab & go place!
 PRICE: ~$20 (I can't remember but it was great pricing) 
 WOULD I COME BACK? Yes!

Overall Rating: 10/10 
- I have become a huge pizza fan after discovering @saucebrosusa  and their employee is the sweetest!
- This pizza is PACKED with AUTHENTIC flavor you cannot find anywhere else especially on a pizza! I was so surprised the beef taco side tasted like authentic Mexican street tacos especially with that spicy green sauce. 
- The nago habanero line (they have chicken, paneer, etc) is basically Desi food on top of pizza and it is actually the best combination ever. The spice level is top tier 
- I cannot wait to go back and order more of their flavors!

Review: Damn that Naga Chicken Pizza is sooo yummm!! Yes, it's spicy hence the mild version but it was delicious! Great NY style pizza, with a tasty crust and the ingredients all tasted super fresh. The owner is super friendly and really cares about making sure customers are happy with his pizza. 

Can't wait to try the other pizzas! I'll be back soon!

Review: I had a truly amazing experience with SauceBros -- while they didn't quite have what I was originally looking for, the pizza I ended up with was delicious and packed with flavor.

Aside from a fantastic flavor profile on their pizza, the staff (especially the owner) went above and beyond to make my order and my visit successful. It's  not often that you get treated to such great hospitality.

Looking forward to my next experience!

Review: I tried this place because it had so many good reviews. Where I think I went wrong was ordering a cheese pizza like a build your own because I was craving pepperoni, mushroom, jalapeño pizza.SauceBros has a lot of specialty pizzas and I should have started off with one of those. My pizza was good, but I have had better. I wish there would have been more pepperonis and the jalapeños were very small. Also, I ordered via Grubhub which took 40 extra mins. My second mistake. By the time it got here, it was cold. I will have to try this place again, but will go there in person and try something that they are known for off their menu.

Review: This spot combined my two favorite things, Korean bbq & pizza ! Also I ate the artichoke pizza which was out of this world amazing ! But if you do go here check out that Korean bbq pizza ! Restaurant was clean and service was nice and easy understanding.

Review: Amazing thin crust pizzas with classic and unique flavors. Tried cheese with honey, naga chicken, pepperoni and naga mushroom. All 4 were absolutely mindblowingly delicious. Definitely coming back for more. I wish the owners would expand to downtown Dallas as a second location so I can get my fix more easily.

Review: After hearing about the pizza from here from multiple people I finally gave this place a shot. I definitely recommend it, as the pizza flavors are innovative and delicious. 8.5/10 for me. The vibes inside are that of a typical small pizza joint, and really added to the experience for me.
----
We got the Bongo Tex Mex with ranch on the side. The Alfredo sauce really tied everything together and the beef was juicy and delicious. The only complaint we had was there was a bit too much grease, which made it a bit soggy as the crust was also quite thin.

Rating: 2 stars
Review: I went here for the first time based upon the reviews.

I got the meat lovers and it was nothing special. I am not sure why this place is so popular. Price was also expensive as they don't have small sizes. They sell pizzas only in 14 and 16 inches. Also, if you order online, they charge you extra fees for that. Not sure who does that. 

I am not sure if I will go back again or not.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: I really wanted to like this place as the owners were so nice, but that's not the case. I ordered 2 pizzas recently (meat lovers and basic cheese) and they were so inedible that we each ate one piece and literally threw away over $50 worth of pizza. The crust was fine, but nothing special. The cheese pizza crust was burnt on the bottom. I don't mind a little char from the ovens, but this went beyond that.
Worst part is the lack of sauce. It was almost undetectable. You would think with the name "sauce" in their name that that wouldn't be an issue. Worst part was the cheese and toppings. The sausage and pepperoni tasted off and the meat lovers seemed burnt on the top. The cheese didn't taste like a typical pizza cheese either. I honestly don't know how you would mess up a pizza that bad, but none of us could stomach another slice.
Maybe it was just an off day for this place, but I am truly baffled by the great reviews. I also might have given them a little grace had the pizza not been so expensive as well as the nearly $5 in fees extra fees added to the online order through their website. I would not have tipped had I noticed the extra fees in the order already.

Review: Phenomenal NY-Style pizza!

Second time coming here and one of the best NY Style Pie's in the city! Added bonus that the Beef Pepperoni is halal and much tastier than what I've had at other places.

Sauce was slightly too sweet this time but it seems that it was a one-off issue, as it generally has been a hit in the past.

Review: I visited this place last week and I was pleasantly surprised! My older son wanted a pizza and he wanted something different from the typical cheese and pepperoni pizza flavors. I searched Yelp and found this place and I am glad I did. We ordered the Shrimp Naga pizza and the Chicken Naga pizza. The guy who took my order over the phone was very friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us when we asked to have spicy sauce on the side for the spicy lovers in our group. He even walked the pizza out to our car when we arrived to pick it up. He told us more about the pizza and how he came up with the toppings for the two pizzas. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure.  

Nevertheless the pizzas were hot and delicious! The Naga sauce is very tasty, was sweet, spicy, and tangy, truly amazing! It's definitely a must try. The only thing I would change would be to add red onions to the Spicy Naga Chicken, I will add it as a topping next time bc it compliments the flavor profile so well. Unfortunately, my kids dug in as soon as I drove off so I don't have any pictures to share! I will definitely get some on the next visit. I'd love to have this place in my neighborhood!

Review: Decided to check out this place after seeing all the rave reviews and photos. Was not disappointed! The ordering process was quick and easy, and the pizza was ready within 10-15 minutes. The owners said every meat item on their menu is hand slaughtered halal, so that's an extra plus. Since we couldn't decide which specialty pizza to try first, we decided to do an X-Large (16-in) half and half with 1/2 Spicy Chicken Naga and 1/2 Meat Lovers.

The Spicy Naga Chicken Pizza tastes like a really good butter chicken pizza but with a little extra kick to it, and the Meat Lovers pizza is also packed with flavor in every bite and theres a generous amount of meat spread throughout! For as much meat and sauce as there was in the pizza, fortunately it wasn't too greasy and you won't end up feeling bloated or like you're having a GERD episode afterwards.

If you enjoy a NY thin crust style pizza or lots of flavor, this place will be right up your alley. If you're a "pizza snob" who watches the One Bite pizza reviews, there's a great amount of flavor and crisp in each bite, and I'd recommend waiting a few minutes before digging in so that you experience a stronger undercarriage and less flop with all the sauces and toppings these pizzas hold.

Had a chance to speak with one of the owners as well, and they were super generous and you can tell that these dudes are super passionate about their pizza! Definitely plan on coming back here often to try out their other specialty pizzas.

Review: Recently tried this place for the first time. The owner  (I believe he was the owner) was very welcoming and helpful, he walked us thru the menu and provided more info and recommendations. The garlic ghee mushroom was my favorite, a lot of great flavor. Unfortunately the cheese pizza was underwhelming. I was expecting a classic cheese pizza but it was more like a margarita pizza.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Great pizza! The Naga sauce is actually spicy! And the garlic ghee mushroom hits the spot!
The texture of the dough is a little stiff, however the flavor of it is comparable to sourdough. They are really friendly when you pick up and the pizzas are ready pretty fast! 
Definitely worth the try, and if you have to... the drive!

Review: After reading it was one of the best Pizzas 2023 we decided to visit.  I had searched for the top pizza places in Plano for dining in. This was not only NOT a dine-in pizza place it was one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. The dough was tough and rubbery.  The sauce was scant and there was a different cheese not a traditional delicious mozzarella but something else that was just awful.  We had the vegetarian pizza. 

Ambiance was non existent. 

You placed your order through a kiosk sitting on a stand.  They still had the nerve to request a tip. Lol.

Review: Sauce bros is fantastic. My bf and I ordered takeout for the first time yesterday and both pizzas were great. Love the fusion concept. They do an amazing job of blending NY pizza with flavors from Bangladesh. We both love Indian food so this was a no brainer for us. Great job guys! Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the large beef pepperoni + jalapeños and large naga chicken in medium. 

I wish I took pics but we just devoured them. Crust was fantastic. Pepperoni was great and we loved that they have beef options as my bf is Muslim and doesn't eat pork. So that was really nice bc we never can get pepperoni anywhere. The naga chicken za was the real star imo. Medium had a decent kick to it so be aware they aren't playing if you don't like spice! It was perfect for us. Definitely check them out! They do have seating inside but it's warm so I think takeout is best! Will be back again next time we want pizza and try the harissa chicken!

Review: Half Spicy naga chicken pizza & pesto beef jhura, not pictured the hot honey cheese pizza. Every bite is filled with so much flavor! My favorite is the spicy naga chicken pizza, (if you look SPICY spicy this one is IT).

Review: Tried this on a whim for dinner! We ordered the Naga Habanero Chicken, medium spicy. We loved it! Was so delicious and flavorful. My husband is a big pizza fan and he enjoyed the crust and dough. He said it reminded him of Papa John's. I'd highly recommend! They have side dishes and pasta as well. The wings looked yummy too! The service was amazing- they offered complimentary drinks while we waited for our pizza and answered all our questions! Our wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad at all. It's small inside, so not a lot of room to eat, but they do have stools and two small tables. Definitely will be back!

Review: Thats a tasty pie!
The owner Red is a good dude- he was able to sneak me in front of a massive SuperBowl order so I was able to pick up a piping hot pizza in 15 minutes. 

Just added SauceBros to the top of my pizza list after polishing off a XL Spicy Naga Chicken. Probably the best pizza I have had in Plano. 

Super thin, perfect dough/crust and the flavor is a 10/10. 

Will be back soon to try some other toppings.

Review: Had the garlic ghee mushroom,  added onion and got a side of HOT HONEY! 
Thin crust, good ratio of ingredients. 

Pick up, not much dining area. Quick, on time, very friendly service. Nice gentlemen helped me select a great pizza, over the phone.

4 star pizza
5 star service

Prices were a little high but understandable,  as they offer halal meats. 

If you are a pizza lover and like interesting pizza choices, you'll love this little spot. Not your ordinary selections. 

Highly recommend.

Review: Taste was decent, but the portion to cost is way off. I e only ordered here once and they got the order wrong, the pizza was a pepperoni 14" for $20! Way over priced considering you can get a 16" at Taverna Rosa for $18 loaded.

Review: If you're looking for good pizza, but something different, then come here. They got cheese and meat lovers, but they also have interesting Indian/Middle Eastern topped pizzas, that once you try, will be a new favorite. The crust is also very good. You can tell by the bite and chew that they let this rise and proof for some time. They have a mural of Portnoy, who is infamous for eating and rating pizza. If I were him, I'd give this place a solid 86.9 on the scale. It's better than all the chain places, but it's not the best I've ever had. SauceBros' edge is being different than what you'd usually find and when I want something different I'll come here.

Review: Excited to try this place based on reviews and their menu offering some unique pies. This is definitely a take out spot -  small location, a counter and a few stools. The beef pepperoni was good, would love if more basil added. For the Spicy Nagy Chicken had requested cilantro on the side but that was missed. And there was a lot and it's a no go for my other half.  The owner offered to remake "them". I came back fifteen minutes later, they remade the Nagy but not the pepperoni. Ideal to have both fresh and ultimately just a miscommunication. He ended up refunding the order which I didn't think was necessary but was a kind gesture. I really liked the Spicy Nagy - the cilantro makes it!  They ask how spicy you want the habanero sauce on the Nagy. We chose most spicy but it was pretty tame. Wonder if we actually got the spiciest!  Great crust!!!  We look forward to trying additional items

Review: We were just looking for a random new pizza place and this one came up.

I was intrigued by the Indian fusion pizzas so we ordered a couple of those. When we got there, the owner and his wife greeted us and were some of the friendliest owners I've ever met! Their customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back!

For the pizza, we tried their garlic ghee mushroom pizza and their beer pesto pizza. Both were incredible flavor bombs! On top of that, their dough was just the perfect amount of crispy without being too chewy or cutting the roof of my mouth! Excited to go back and try more!

Review: This isn't your typical pizza place. They have mostly exotic style pizza. Way too expensive imo. We got the traditional pepperoni, which was good for $10. Unfortunately, they charge $17. No way! We also got a weird specialty pizza and it wasn't even edible. The owner was very nice and even gave us a free pizza, knowing the one we got was a required taste. So he recommended the taco pizza. At first bite, it reminded me nothing of a taco but the ingredients were similar. It was spicy /5/10 and pretty tasty. But again, $23, way too expensive and not even for their largest pizza

 WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR: unique flavored pizzas. It's NYC style pizza with a Bangladeshi fusion, I didn't know what to choose!
 THE VIBE: just a quick grab & go place!
 PRICE: ~$20 (I can't remember but it was great pricing) 
 WOULD I COME BACK? Yes!

- I have become a huge pizza fan after discovering @saucebrosusa  and their employee is the sweetest!
- This pizza is PACKED with AUTHENTIC flavor you cannot find anywhere else especially on a pizza! I was so surprised the beef taco side tasted like authentic Mexican street tacos especially with that spicy green sauce. 
- The nago habanero line (they have chicken, paneer, etc) is basically Desi food on top of pizza and it is actually the best combination ever. The spice level is top tier 
- I cannot wait to go back and order more of their flavors!

Review: Damn that Naga Chicken Pizza is sooo yummm!! Yes, it's spicy hence the mild version but it was delicious! Great NY style pizza, with a tasty crust and the ingredients all tasted super fresh. The owner is super friendly and really cares about making sure customers are happy with his pizza. 

Can't wait to try the other pizzas! I'll be back soon!

Review: I had a truly amazing experience with SauceBros -- while they didn't quite have what I was originally looking for, the pizza I ended up with was delicious and packed with flavor.

Aside from a fantastic flavor profile on their pizza, the staff (especially the owner) went above and beyond to make my order and my visit successful. It's  not often that you get treated to such great hospitality.

Looking forward to my next experience!

Review: I tried this place because it had so many good reviews. Where I think I went wrong was ordering a cheese pizza like a build your own because I was craving pepperoni, mushroom, jalapeño pizza.SauceBros has a lot of specialty pizzas and I should have started off with one of those. My pizza was good, but I have had better. I wish there would have been more pepperonis and the jalapeños were very small. Also, I ordered via Grubhub which took 40 extra mins. My second mistake. By the time it got here, it was cold. I will have to try this place again, but will go there in person and try something that they are known for off their menu.

Review: Amazing thin crust pizzas with classic and unique flavors. Tried cheese with honey, naga chicken, pepperoni and naga mushroom. All 4 were absolutely mindblowingly delicious.

Review: After hearing about the pizza from here from multiple people I finally gave this place a shot. I definitely recommend it, as the pizza flavors are innovative and delicious. 8.5/10 for me. The vibes inside are that of a typical small pizza joint, and really added to the experience for me.

We got the Bongo Tex Mex with ranch on the side. The Alfredo sauce really tied everything together and the beef was juicy and delicious. The only complaint we had was there was a bit too much grease, which made it a bit soggy as the crust was also quite thin.

Review: I went here for the first time based upon the reviews.

I got the meat lovers and it was nothing special. I am not sure why this place is so popular. Price was also expensive as they don't have small sizes. They sell pizzas only in 14 and 16 inches. Also, if you order online, they charge you extra fees for that. Not sure who does that. 

I am not sure if I will go back again or not.

Review: I really wanted to like this place as the owners were so nice, but that's not the case. I ordered 2 pizzas recently (meat lovers and basic cheese) and they were so inedible that we each ate one piece and literally threw away over $50 worth of pizza. The crust was fine, but nothing special. The cheese pizza crust was burnt on the bottom. I don't mind a little char from the ovens, but this went beyond that.
Worst part is the lack of sauce. It was almost undetectable. You would think with the name "sauce" in their name that that wouldn't be an issue. Worst part was the cheese and toppings. The sausage and pepperoni tasted off and the meat lovers seemed burnt on the top. The cheese didn't taste like a typical pizza cheese either. I honestly don't know how you would mess up a pizza that bad, but none of us could stomach another slice.
Maybe it was just an off day for this place, but I am truly baffled by the great reviews. I also might have given them a little grace had the pizza not been so expensive as well as the nearly $5 in fees extra fees added to the online order through their website. I would not have tipped had I noticed the extra fees in the order already.

Second time coming here and one of the best NY Style Pie's in the city! Added bonus that the Beef Pepperoni is halal and much tastier than what I've had at other places.

Sauce was slightly too sweet this time but it seems that it was a one-off issue, as it generally has been a hit in the past.

Review: I visited this place last week and I was pleasantly surprised! My older son wanted a pizza and he wanted something different from the typical cheese and pepperoni pizza flavors. I searched Yelp and found this place and I am glad I did. We ordered the Shrimp Naga pizza and the Chicken Naga pizza. The guy who took my order over the phone was very friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us when we asked to have spicy sauce on the side for the spicy lovers in our group. He even walked the pizza out to our car when we arrived to pick it up. He told us more about the pizza and how he came up with the toppings for the two pizzas. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure.  

Nevertheless the pizzas were hot and delicious! The Naga sauce is very tasty, was sweet, spicy, and tangy, truly amazing! It's definitely a must try. The only thing I would change would be to add red onions to the Spicy Naga Chicken, I will add it as a topping next time bc it compliments the flavor profile so well. Unfortunately, my kids dug in as soon as I drove off so I don't have any pictures to share! I will definitely get some on the next visit. I'd love to have this place in my neighborhood!

Review: Decided to check out this place after seeing all the rave reviews and photos. Was not disappointed! The ordering process was quick and easy, and the pizza was ready within 10-15 minutes. The owners said every meat item on their menu is hand slaughtered halal, so that's an extra plus. Since we couldn't decide which specialty pizza to try first, we decided to do an X-Large (16-in) half and half with 1/2 Spicy Chicken Naga and 1/2 Meat Lovers.

The Spicy Naga Chicken Pizza tastes like a really good butter chicken pizza but with a little extra kick to it, and the Meat Lovers pizza is also packed with flavor in every bite and theres a generous amount of meat spread throughout! For as much meat and sauce as there was in the pizza, fortunately it wasn't too greasy and you won't end up feeling bloated or like you're having a GERD episode afterwards.

If you enjoy a NY thin crust style pizza or lots of flavor, this place will be right up your alley. If you're a "pizza snob" who watches the One Bite pizza reviews, there's a great amount of flavor and crisp in each bite, and I'd recommend waiting a few minutes before digging in so that you experience a stronger undercarriage and less flop with all the sauces and toppings these pizzas hold.

Had a chance to speak with one of the owners as well, and they were super generous and you can tell that these dudes are super passionate about their pizza! Definitely plan on coming back here often to try out their other specialty pizzas.

Review: Recently tried this place for the first time. The owner  (I believe he was the owner) was very welcoming and helpful, he walked us thru the menu and provided more info and recommendations. The garlic ghee mushroom was my favorite, a lot of great flavor. Unfortunately the cheese pizza was underwhelming. I was expecting a classic cheese pizza but it was more like a margarita pizza.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Great pizza! The Naga sauce is actually spicy! And the garlic ghee mushroom hits the spot!
The texture of the dough is a little stiff, however the flavor of it is comparable to sourdough. They are really friendly when you pick up and the pizzas are ready pretty fast! 
Definitely worth the try, and if you have to... the drive!

Review: After reading it was one of the best Pizzas 2023 we decided to visit.  I had searched for the top pizza places in Plano for dining in. This was not only NOT a dine-in pizza place it was one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. The dough was tough and rubbery.  The sauce was scant and there was a different cheese not a traditional delicious mozzarella but something else that was just awful.  We had the vegetarian pizza. 

Ambiance was non existent. 

You placed your order through a kiosk sitting on a stand.  They still had the nerve to request a tip. Lol.

Review: Sauce bros is fantastic. My bf and I ordered takeout for the first time yesterday and both pizzas were great. Love the fusion concept. They do an amazing job of blending NY pizza with flavors from Bangladesh. We both love Indian food so this was a no brainer for us. Great job guys! Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the large beef pepperoni + jalapeños and large naga chicken in medium. 

I wish I took pics but we just devoured them. Crust was fantastic. Pepperoni was great and we loved that they have beef options as my bf is Muslim and doesn't eat pork. So that was really nice bc we never can get pepperoni anywhere. The naga chicken za was the real star imo. Medium had a decent kick to it so be aware they aren't playing if you don't like spice! It was perfect for us. Definitely check them out! They do have seating inside but it's warm so I think takeout is best! Will be back again next time we want pizza and try the harissa chicken!

Review: Half Spicy naga chicken pizza & pesto beef jhura, not pictured the hot honey cheese pizza. Every bite is filled with so much flavor! My favorite is the spicy naga chicken pizza, (if you look SPICY spicy this one is IT).

Review: Tried this on a whim for dinner! We ordered the Naga Habanero Chicken, medium spicy. We loved it! Was so delicious and flavorful. My husband is a big pizza fan and he enjoyed the crust and dough. He said it reminded him of Papa John's. I'd highly recommend! They have side dishes and pasta as well. The wings looked yummy too! The service was amazing- they offered complimentary drinks while we waited for our pizza and answered all our questions! Our wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad at all. It's small inside, so not a lot of room to eat, but they do have stools and two small tables. Definitely will be back!

Review: Thats a tasty pie!
The owner Red is a good dude- he was able to sneak me in front of a massive SuperBowl order so I was able to pick up a piping hot pizza in 15 minutes. 

Just added SauceBros to the top of my pizza list after polishing off a XL Spicy Naga Chicken. Probably the best pizza I have had in Plano. 

Super thin, perfect dough/crust and the flavor is a 10/10. 

Will be back soon to try some other toppings.

Review: Had the garlic ghee mushroom,  added onion and got a side of HOT HONEY! 
Thin crust, good ratio of ingredients. 

Pick up, not much dining area. Quick, on time, very friendly service. Nice gentlemen helped me select a great pizza, over the phone.

4 star pizza
5 star service

Prices were a little high but understandable,  as they offer halal meats. 

If you are a pizza lover and like interesting pizza choices, you'll love this little spot. Not your ordinary selections. 

Highly recommend.

Review: Taste was decent, but the portion to cost is way off. I e only ordered here once and they got the order wrong, the pizza was a pepperoni 14" for $20! Way over priced considering you can get a 16" at Taverna Rosa for $18 loaded.

Review: If you're looking for good pizza, but something different, then come here. They got cheese and meat lovers, but they also have interesting Indian/Middle Eastern topped pizzas, that once you try, will be a new favorite. The crust is also very good. You can tell by the bite and chew that they let this rise and proof for some time. They have a mural of Portnoy, who is infamous for eating and rating pizza. If I were him, I'd give this place a solid 86.9 on the scale. It's better than all the chain places, but it's not the best I've ever had. SauceBros' edge is being different than what you'd usually find and when I want something different I'll come here.

Review: Excited to try this place based on reviews and their menu offering some unique pies. This is definitely a take out spot -  small location, a counter and a few stools. The beef pepperoni was good, would love if more basil added. For the Spicy Nagy Chicken had requested cilantro on the side but that was missed. And there was a lot and it's a no go for my other half.  The owner offered to remake "them". I came back fifteen minutes later, they remade the Nagy but not the pepperoni. Ideal to have both fresh and ultimately just a miscommunication. He ended up refunding the order which I didn't think was necessary but was a kind gesture. I really liked the Spicy Nagy - the cilantro makes it!  They ask how spicy you want the habanero sauce on the Nagy. We chose most spicy but it was pretty tame. Wonder if we actually got the spiciest!  Great crust!!!  We look forward to trying additional items

Review: We were just looking for a random new pizza place and this one came up.

I was intrigued by the Indian fusion pizzas so we ordered a couple of those. When we got there, the owner and his wife greeted us and were some of the friendliest owners I've ever met! Their customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back!

For the pizza, we tried their garlic ghee mushroom pizza and their beer pesto pizza. Both were incredible flavor bombs! On top of that, their dough was just the perfect amount of crispy without being too chewy or cutting the roof of my mouth! Excited to go back and try more!

Ordered the chicken Bianca and it was ready in about 12 mins, loved that. The guys offered me a free drink while I waited which was so thoughtful on a 109 degree day. The sauce was great but the crust was really the stand out feature! It's hard to get me to cheat on Zalat but Sauce Bros actually has me excited to try them again and more of their flavors!! 5/5 stars!

Review: If I could give it any higher stars then I would. This place is awesome! Full of flavors. We were visiting Dallas and found this gem. 

The owner is from NYC so he gets it--pizza is all about the sauce and the dough. The sauce here an the dough are amazing. I am from NYC so I know pizza as well and I'd highly recommend their pizza. I had the Naga chicken Pizza and Jhura beef. It was good so two days later we ordered it again. I eat halal meat only and this place has halal pizza with desi flavors. If you like spicy then this is the place! I just loved it. 

Also, the owner is a great guy. So hospitable. He gave us tons of recommendation for good Dallas  area restaurants.

Review: At first I was a little skeptical about SauceBros because there's a million pizzerias nearby so why go to one in Plano? The search for great pizza of course. Ryan said he had already done the homework and Frisco was out of good pizza places. Trust. 

This place is literally hole in the wall. There is no restroom nor a whole lot of place to sit. In fact I literally questioned Ryan on whether or not we'd actually get a seat here at this place on a Sunday night. My fears were eased when we rolled in and scored the seats by the window. 

We ordered an naga habanero half chicken and half beef bengali beef pesto pizza using their kiosk. I also wised up and ordered a side of garlic for dipping and hot honey right on the pizza itself. A fantastic combination I might add. *Pats self on the back*. They use the super Costco pizza ovens so several can go in at once.

It's probably better to order ahead of time instead of sitting around and waiting (they do doordash/phone/online orders too). There were several people that came in to pick up their to-go orders. I wouldn't dine-in here unless you have no other place to eat your pizza. Their beverage selection was pricey and was also a little lackluster so don't count on them having what you want.

Review: This pizza is FIRE. The pizza is fantastic -- get the Harissa Chicken, the Korean BBQ Beef, and the 4 Cheese W/ Honey. I get my extra crispy and it comes out perfect! Great service, quick and easy for Takeout (they only have a couple seats to eat in). The staff is very kind!

Rating: 4 stars
Review: A solid place to try out if you want to try unique pizza flavors! This place is an Indian-style pizza place that has unique fusions. The store is really really small so I recommend ordering ahead for takeout if you're going with friends. The service was great and the staff were friendly. I preferred the beef taco pizza flavor over the Naga habanero chicken but both were definitely unique. The chicken Alfredo was pretty good with the flavor that you would expect. I would recommend to come try it out at least once and see how yuh like it!

Review: We ordered one each of the  Meat Lovers and BBQ Korean pizzas and each one tasted exactly the same.  This place was overhyped by Dallas Morning News and left us $80 poorer. Who spends $80 for pizza??? Definitely not us again.

Waay too much BBQ sauce which took away from the taste of the actual pizza itself. When one orders a pizza, one expects a tomato or white sauce, not BBQ sauce as the main ingredient. The sauce made the pizza almost sickeningly sweet and we had to throw over half of it away. Will never order from this place again.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I have been waiting to try this place for so long, but they're closed on Mondays when I'm usually free. Finally hit them up on another weekday evening and it was fire! I called ahead 15 mins to place a take out order. The interior is veryyy small so I'd suggest you order for take out. They allow you to do 2 different flavors on a pizza so we tried the Korean Bbq and the naga habanero chicken. I loved that they ask how spicy you want the naga habanero to be and it's legit spicy so beware! The Korean bbq imo just tasted like American bbq sauce but it was still good. My favorite was the naga habanero. I would come back and order the naga plus a new flavor to try!

Review: I am picky when it comes to pizza and that's because I have tried a lot! This is hands down the best pizza I have had in DFW. I recently moved to Plano and found them on UberEats. AMAZING. I've order at least 10 times now in the past few months. If you love a rich sweet red wine sauce, this is the pizza place for you. My only complaint is not being able to order on UberEats until after 3 pm but it's probably because they're so busy making that sauce with love that it takes a little more time. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Review: I was so excited to find out about this place and my first pizza which was simply the beef pepperoni and cheese was great! I have to admit in full disclosure that I am a very picky pizza eater being from the NYC area originally. I love a thin crispy crust and have always been a fan of beef pepperoni on a pizza. We were so excited, we thought finally we have found a great pizza place! Unfortunately, the next two pizzas that I ordered were totally different from the first one that I received. Exact same order other than I added additional beef pepperoni. But on the second two, the crust wasn't crispy and it was hard to believe that these had come from the same place that I had gotten the same pizza from just a week earlier. It was just OK and for the price I paid for six slices of pizza and the large size. I know that unfortunately I will still be looking for a great thin crispy crust pizza. My hopes were high, but unfortunately, the consistency was not there. With the number of people in West Plano that are from the east coast it seems unbelievable that we can't get great pizza in this area.

Review: Decided to check out this place after seeing all the rave reviews and photos. Was not disappointed! The ordering process was quick and easy, and the pizza was ready within 10-15 minutes. The owners said every meat item on their menu is hand slaughtered halal, so that's an extra plus. Since we couldn't decide which specialty pizza to try first, we decided to do an X-Large (16-in) half and half with 1/2 Spicy Chicken Naga and 1/2 Meat Lovers.

The Spicy Naga Chicken Pizza tastes like a really good butter chicken pizza but with a little extra kick to it, and the Meat Lovers pizza is also packed with flavor in every bite and theres a generous amount of meat spread throughout! For as much meat and sauce as there was in the pizza, fortunately it wasn't too greasy and you won't end up feeling bloated or like you're having a GERD episode afterwards.

If you enjoy a NY thin crust style pizza or lots of flavor, this place will be right up your alley. If you're a "pizza snob" who watches the One Bite pizza reviews, there's a great amount of flavor and crisp in each bite, and I'd recommend waiting a few minutes before digging in so that you experience a stronger undercarriage and less flop with all the sauces and toppings these pizzas hold.

Had a chance to speak with one of the owners as well, and they were super generous and you can tell that these dudes are super passionate about their pizza! Definitely plan on coming back here often to try out their other specialty pizzas.

Review: Recently tried this place for the first time. The owner  (I believe he was the owner) was very welcoming and helpful, he walked us thru the menu and provided more info and recommendations. The garlic ghee mushroom was my favorite, a lot of great flavor. Unfortunately the cheese pizza was underwhelming. I was expecting a classic cheese pizza but it was more like a margarita pizza.

Review: Great pizza! The Naga sauce is actually spicy! And the garlic ghee mushroom hits the spot!
The texture of the dough is a little stiff, however the flavor of it is comparable to sourdough. They are really friendly when you pick up and the pizzas are ready pretty fast! 
Definitely worth the try, and if you have to... the drive!

Review: After reading it was one of the best Pizzas 2023 we decided to visit.  I had searched for the top pizza places in Plano for dining in. This was not only NOT a dine-in pizza place it was one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. The dough was tough and rubbery.  The sauce was scant and there was a different cheese not a traditional delicious mozzarella but something else that was just awful.  We had the vegetarian pizza. 

Ambiance was non existent. 

You placed your order through a kiosk sitting on a stand.  They still had the nerve to request a tip. Lol.

Review: Sauce bros is fantastic. My bf and I ordered takeout for the first time yesterday and both pizzas were great. Love the fusion concept. They do an amazing job of blending NY pizza with flavors from Bangladesh. We both love Indian food so this was a no brainer for us. Great job guys! Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the large beef pepperoni + jalapeños and large naga chicken in medium. 

I wish I took pics but we just devoured them. Crust was fantastic. Pepperoni was great and we loved that they have beef options as my bf is Muslim and doesn't eat pork. So that was really nice bc we never can get pepperoni anywhere. The naga chicken za was the real star imo. Medium had a decent kick to it so be aware they aren't playing if you don't like spice! It was perfect for us. Definitely check them out! They do have seating inside but it's warm so I think takeout is best! Will be back again next time we want pizza and try the harissa chicken!

My husband is a big pizza fan and he enjoyed the crust and dough. He said it reminded him of Papa John's. I'd highly recommend! They have side dishes and pasta as well. The wings looked yummy too! The service was amazing- they offered complimentary drinks while we waited for our pizza and answered all our questions! Our wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad at all. It's small inside, so not a lot of room to eat, but they do have stools and two small tables. Definitely will be back!

The owner Red is a good dude- he was able to sneak me in front of a massive SuperBowl order so I was able to pick up a piping hot pizza in 15 minutes. 

Just added SauceBros to the top of my pizza list after polishing off a XL Spicy Naga Chicken. Probably the best pizza I have had in Plano. 

Super thin, perfect dough/crust and the flavor is a 10/10.

Review: If you're looking for good pizza, but something different, then come here. They got cheese and meat lovers, but they also have interesting Indian/Middle Eastern topped pizzas, that once you try, will be a new favorite. The crust is also very good. You can tell by the bite and chew that they let this rise and proof for some time. They have a mural of Portnoy, who is infamous for eating and rating pizza. If I were him, I'd give this place a solid 86.9 on the scale. It's better than all the chain places, but it's not the best I've ever had. SauceBros' edge is being different than what you'd usually find and when I want something different I'll come here.

Review: Excited to try this place based on reviews and their menu offering some unique pies. This is definitely a take out spot -  small location, a counter and a few stools. The beef pepperoni was good, would love if more basil added. For the Spicy Nagy Chicken had requested cilantro on the side but that was missed. And there was a lot and it's a no go for my other half.  The owner offered to remake "them". I came back fifteen minutes later, they remade the Nagy but not the pepperoni. Ideal to have both fresh and ultimately just a miscommunication. He ended up refunding the order which I didn't think was necessary but was a kind gesture. I really liked the Spicy Nagy - the cilantro makes it!  They ask how spicy you want the habanero sauce on the Nagy. We chose most spicy but it was pretty tame. Wonder if we actually got the spiciest!  Great crust!!!  We look forward to trying additional items

Review: We were just looking for a random new pizza place and this one came up.

I was intrigued by the Indian fusion pizzas so we ordered a couple of those. When we got there, the owner and his wife greeted us and were some of the friendliest owners I've ever met! Their customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back!

For the pizza, we tried their garlic ghee mushroom pizza and their beer pesto pizza. Both were incredible flavor bombs! On top of that, their dough was just the perfect amount of crispy without being too chewy or cutting the roof of my mouth! Excited to go back and try more!

Review: We are here for my husband's work and have had some mediocre and EXPENSIVE food around the Plano area. We found this gem driving around and I am SO glad we did! Amazing pizza, perfect amount of cheese, sauce and meat. You can tell the veggies were fresh! The employees were so nice and accommodating! Very clean establishment and the prices were great compared to other places. We will definitely dine here again, before heading back home! The owner Red was very nice and kept the little one busy while mom and dad ate. Thank you for a great experience!

Review: Super yummy pizza! Owners were kind and brought the pizza out to my car which was great on this pregnant ladies swollen feet. Ordered the chicken Bianca and it was ready in about 12 mins, loved that. The guys offered me a free drink while I waited which was so thoughtful on a 109 degree day. The sauce was great but the crust was really the stand out feature! It's hard to get me to cheat on Zalat but Sauce Bros actually has me excited to try them again and more of their flavors!! 5/5 stars!

Review: If I could give it any higher stars then I would. This place is awesome! Full of flavors. We were visiting Dallas and found this gem. 

The owner is from NYC so he gets it--pizza is all about the sauce and the dough. The sauce here an the dough are amazing. I am from NYC so I know pizza as well and I'd highly recommend their pizza. I had the Naga chicken Pizza and Jhura beef. It was good so two days later we ordered it again. I eat halal meat only and this place has halal pizza with desi flavors. If you like spicy then this is the place! I just loved it. 

Also, the owner is a great guy. So hospitable. He gave us tons of recommendation for good Dallas  area restaurants.

Review: At first I was a little skeptical about SauceBros because there's a million pizzerias nearby so why go to one in Plano? The search for great pizza of course. Ryan said he had already done the homework and Frisco was out of good pizza places. Trust. 

This place is literally hole in the wall. There is no restroom nor a whole lot of place to sit. In fact I literally questioned Ryan on whether or not we'd actually get a seat here at this place on a Sunday night. My fears were eased when we rolled in and scored the seats by the window. 

We ordered an naga habanero half chicken and half beef bengali beef pesto pizza using their kiosk. I also wised up and ordered a side of garlic for dipping and hot honey right on the pizza itself. A fantastic combination I might add. *Pats self on the back*. They use the super Costco pizza ovens so several can go in at once.

It's probably better to order ahead of time instead of sitting around and waiting (they do doordash/phone/online orders too). There were several people that came in to pick up their to-go orders. I wouldn't dine-in here unless you have no other place to eat your pizza. Their beverage selection was pricey and was also a little lackluster so don't count on them having what you want.

Review: This pizza is FIRE. The pizza is fantastic -- get the Harissa Chicken, the Korean BBQ Beef, and the 4 Cheese W/ Honey. I get my extra crispy and it comes out perfect! Great service, quick and easy for Takeout (they only have a couple seats to eat in). The staff is very kind!

Rating: 4 stars
Review: A solid place to try out if you want to try unique pizza flavors! This place is an Indian-style pizza place that has unique fusions. The store is really really small so I recommend ordering ahead for takeout if you're going with friends. The service was great and the staff were friendly. I preferred the beef taco pizza flavor over the Naga habanero chicken but both were definitely unique. The chicken Alfredo was pretty good with the flavor that you would expect. I would recommend to come try it out at least once and see how yuh like it!

Rating: 1 stars
Review: We ordered one each of the  Meat Lovers and BBQ Korean pizzas and each one tasted exactly the same.  This place was overhyped by Dallas Morning News and left us $80 poorer. Who spends $80 for pizza??? Definitely not us again.

Waay too much BBQ sauce which took away from the taste of the actual pizza itself. When one orders a pizza, one expects a tomato or white sauce, not BBQ sauce as the main ingredient. The sauce made the pizza almost sickeningly sweet and we had to throw over half of it away. Will never order from this place again.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I have been waiting to try this place for so long, but they're closed on Mondays when I'm usually free. Finally hit them up on another weekday evening and it was fire! I called ahead 15 mins to place a take out order. The interior is veryyy small so I'd suggest you order for take out. They allow you to do 2 different flavors on a pizza so we tried the Korean Bbq and the naga habanero chicken. I loved that they ask how spicy you want the naga habanero to be and it's legit spicy so beware! The Korean bbq imo just tasted like American bbq sauce but it was still good. My favorite was the naga habanero. I would come back and order the naga plus a new flavor to try!

Review: I am picky when it comes to pizza and that's because I have tried a lot! This is hands down the best pizza I have had in DFW. I recently moved to Plano and found them on UberEats. AMAZING. I've order at least 10 times now in the past few months. If you love a rich sweet red wine sauce, this is the pizza place for you. My only complaint is not being able to order on UberEats until after 3 pm but it's probably because they're so busy making that sauce with love that it takes a little more time. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Review: I was so excited to find out about this place and my first pizza which was simply the beef pepperoni and cheese was great! I have to admit in full disclosure that I am a very picky pizza eater being from the NYC area originally. I love a thin crispy crust and have always been a fan of beef pepperoni on a pizza. We were so excited, we thought finally we have found a great pizza place! Unfortunately, the next two pizzas that I ordered were totally different from the first one that I received. Exact same order other than I added additional beef pepperoni. But on the second two, the crust wasn't crispy and it was hard to believe that these had come from the same place that I had gotten the same pizza from just a week earlier. It was just OK and for the price I paid for six slices of pizza and the large size. I know that unfortunately I will still be looking for a great thin crispy crust pizza. My hopes were high, but unfortunately, the consistency was not there. With the number of people in West Plano that are from the east coast it seems unbelievable that we can't get great pizza in this area.

Review: This isn't your typical pizza place. They have mostly exotic style pizza. Way too expensive imo. We got the traditional pepperoni, which was good for $10. Unfortunately, they charge $17. No way! We also got a weird specialty pizza and it wasn't even edible. The owner was very nice and even gave us a free pizza, knowing the one we got was a required taste. So he recommended the taco pizza. At first bite, it reminded me nothing of a taco but the ingredients were similar. It was spicy /5/10 and pretty tasty. But again, $23, way too expensive and not even for their largest pizza

 WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR: unique flavored pizzas. It's NYC style pizza with a Bangladeshi fusion, I didn't know what to choose!

 PRICE: ~$20 (I can't remember but it was great pricing) 
 WOULD I COME BACK? Yes!

Overall Rating: 10/10 
- I have become a huge pizza fan after discovering @saucebrosusa  and their employee is the sweetest!
- This pizza is PACKED with AUTHENTIC flavor you cannot find anywhere else especially on a pizza! I was so surprised the beef taco side tasted like authentic Mexican street tacos especially with that spicy green sauce. 
- The nago habanero line (they have chicken, paneer, etc) is basically Desi food on top of pizza and it is actually the best combination ever. The spice level is top tier 
- I cannot wait to go back and order more of their flavors!

Review: Damn that Naga Chicken Pizza is sooo yummm!! Yes, it's spicy hence the mild version but it was delicious! Great NY style pizza, with a tasty crust and the ingredients all tasted super fresh. The owner is super friendly and really cares about making sure customers are happy with his pizza. 

Can't wait to try the other pizzas! I'll be back soon!

Review: I had a truly amazing experience with SauceBros -- while they didn't quite have what I was originally looking for, the pizza I ended up with was delicious and packed with flavor.

Aside from a fantastic flavor profile on their pizza, the staff (especially the owner) went above and beyond to make my order and my visit successful. It's  not often that you get treated to such great hospitality.

Looking forward to my next experience!

Review: I tried this place because it had so many good reviews. Where I think I went wrong was ordering a cheese pizza like a build your own because I was craving pepperoni, mushroom, jalapeño pizza.SauceBros has a lot of specialty pizzas and I should have started off with one of those. My pizza was good, but I have had better. I wish there would have been more pepperonis and the jalapeños were very small. Also, I ordered via Grubhub which took 40 extra mins. My second mistake. By the time it got here, it was cold. I will have to try this place again, but will go there in person and try something that they are known for off their menu.

Review: Amazing thin crust pizzas with classic and unique flavors. Tried cheese with honey, naga chicken, pepperoni and naga mushroom. All 4 were absolutely mindblowingly delicious. Definitely coming back for more. I wish the owners would expand to downtown Dallas as a second location so I can get my fix more easily.

Review: After hearing about the pizza from here from multiple people I finally gave this place a shot. I definitely recommend it, as the pizza flavors are innovative and delicious. 8.5/10 for me. The vibes inside are that of a typical small pizza joint, and really added to the experience for me.
----
We got the Bongo Tex Mex with ranch on the side. The Alfredo sauce really tied everything together and the beef was juicy and delicious. The only complaint we had was there was a bit too much grease, which made it a bit soggy as the crust was also quite thin.

Review: I went here for the first time based upon the reviews.

I got the meat lovers and it was nothing special. I am not sure why this place is so popular. Price was also expensive as they don't have small sizes. They sell pizzas only in 14 and 16 inches. Also, if you order online, they charge you extra fees for that. Not sure who does that. 

I am not sure if I will go back again or not.

Review: I really wanted to like this place as the owners were so nice, but that's not the case. I ordered 2 pizzas recently (meat lovers and basic cheese) and they were so inedible that we each ate one piece and literally threw away over $50 worth of pizza. The crust was fine, but nothing special. The cheese pizza crust was burnt on the bottom. I don't mind a little char from the ovens, but this went beyond that.
Worst part is the lack of sauce. It was almost undetectable. You would think with the name "sauce" in their name that that wouldn't be an issue. Worst part was the cheese and toppings. The sausage and pepperoni tasted off and the meat lovers seemed burnt on the top. The cheese didn't taste like a typical pizza cheese either. I honestly don't know how you would mess up a pizza that bad, but none of us could stomach another slice.
Maybe it was just an off day for this place, but I am truly baffled by the great reviews. I also might have given them a little grace had the pizza not been so expensive as well as the nearly $5 in fees extra fees added to the online order through their website. I would not have tipped had I noticed the extra fees in the order already.

Second time coming here and one of the best NY Style Pie's in the city! Added bonus that the Beef Pepperoni is halal and much tastier than what I've had at other places.

Sauce was slightly too sweet this time but it seems that it was a one-off issue, as it generally has been a hit in the past.

Review: I visited this place last week and I was pleasantly surprised! My older son wanted a pizza and he wanted something different from the typical cheese and pepperoni pizza flavors. I searched Yelp and found this place and I am glad I did. We ordered the Shrimp Naga pizza and the Chicken Naga pizza. The guy who took my order over the phone was very friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us when we asked to have spicy sauce on the side for the spicy lovers in our group. He even walked the pizza out to our car when we arrived to pick it up. He told us more about the pizza and how he came up with the toppings for the two pizzas. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure.  

Nevertheless the pizzas were hot and delicious! The Naga sauce is very tasty, was sweet, spicy, and tangy, truly amazing! It's definitely a must try. The only thing I would change would be to add red onions to the Spicy Naga Chicken, I will add it as a topping next time bc it compliments the flavor profile so well. Unfortunately, my kids dug in as soon as I drove off so I don't have any pictures to share! I will definitely get some on the next visit. I'd love to have this place in my neighborhood!

Review: Excited to try this place based on reviews and their menu offering some unique pies. This is definitely a take out spot -  small location, a counter and a few stools. The beef pepperoni was good, would love if more basil added. For the Spicy Nagy Chicken had requested cilantro on the side but that was missed. And there was a lot and it's a no go for my other half.  The owner offered to remake "them". I came back fifteen minutes later, they remade the Nagy but not the pepperoni. Ideal to have both fresh and ultimately just a miscommunication. He ended up refunding the order which I didn't think was necessary but was a kind gesture. I really liked the Spicy Nagy - the cilantro makes it!  They ask how spicy you want the habanero sauce on the Nagy. We chose most spicy but it was pretty tame. Wonder if we actually got the spiciest!  Great crust!!!  We look forward to trying additional items

Review: We were just looking for a random new pizza place and this one came up.

I was intrigued by the Indian fusion pizzas so we ordered a couple of those. When we got there, the owner and his wife greeted us and were some of the friendliest owners I've ever met! Their customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back!

For the pizza, we tried their garlic ghee mushroom pizza and their beer pesto pizza. Both were incredible flavor bombs! On top of that, their dough was just the perfect amount of crispy without being too chewy or cutting the roof of my mouth! Excited to go back and try more!

Review: We are here for my husband's work and have had some mediocre and EXPENSIVE food around the Plano area. We found this gem driving around and I am SO glad we did! Amazing pizza, perfect amount of cheese, sauce and meat. You can tell the veggies were fresh! The employees were so nice and accommodating! Very clean establishment and the prices were great compared to other places. We will definitely dine here again, before heading back home! The owner Red was very nice and kept the little one busy while mom and dad ate. Thank you for a great experience!

Review: Super yummy pizza! Owners were kind and brought the pizza out to my car which was great on this pregnant ladies swollen feet. Ordered the chicken Bianca and it was ready in about 12 mins, loved that. The guys offered me a free drink while I waited which was so thoughtful on a 109 degree day. The sauce was great but the crust was really the stand out feature! It's hard to get me to cheat on Zalat but Sauce Bros actually has me excited to try them again and more of their flavors!! 5/5 stars!

The owner is from NYC so he gets it--pizza is all about the sauce and the dough. The sauce here an the dough are amazing. I am from NYC so I know pizza as well and I'd highly recommend their pizza. I had the Naga chicken Pizza and Jhura beef. It was good so two days later we ordered it again. I eat halal meat only and this place has halal pizza with desi flavors. If you like spicy then this is the place! I just loved it. 

Also, the owner is a great guy. So hospitable. He gave us tons of recommendation for good Dallas  area restaurants.

Review: At first I was a little skeptical about SauceBros because there's a million pizzerias nearby so why go to one in Plano? The search for great pizza of course. Ryan said he had already done the homework and Frisco was out of good pizza places. Trust. 

This place is literally hole in the wall. There is no restroom nor a whole lot of place to sit. In fact I literally questioned Ryan on whether or not we'd actually get a seat here at this place on a Sunday night. My fears were eased when we rolled in and scored the seats by the window. 

We ordered an naga habanero half chicken and half beef bengali beef pesto pizza using their kiosk. I also wised up and ordered a side of garlic for dipping and hot honey right on the pizza itself. A fantastic combination I might add. *Pats self on the back*. They use the super Costco pizza ovens so several can go in at once.

It's probably better to order ahead of time instead of sitting around and waiting (they do doordash/phone/online orders too). There were several people that came in to pick up their to-go orders. I wouldn't dine-in here unless you have no other place to eat your pizza. Their beverage selection was pricey and was also a little lackluster so don't count on them having what you want.

Review: This pizza is FIRE. The pizza is fantastic -- get the Harissa Chicken, the Korean BBQ Beef, and the 4 Cheese W/ Honey. I get my extra crispy and it comes out perfect! Great service, quick and easy for Takeout (they only have a couple seats to eat in). The staff is very kind!

Review: A solid place to try out if you want to try unique pizza flavors! This place is an Indian-style pizza place that has unique fusions. The store is really really small so I recommend ordering ahead for takeout if you're going with friends. The service was great and the staff were friendly. I preferred the beef taco pizza flavor over the Naga habanero chicken but both were definitely unique. The chicken Alfredo was pretty good with the flavor that you would expect. I would recommend to come try it out at least once and see how yuh like it!

Review: We ordered one each of the  Meat Lovers and BBQ Korean pizzas and each one tasted exactly the same.  This place was overhyped by Dallas Morning News and left us $80 poorer. Who spends $80 for pizza??? Definitely not us again.

Waay too much BBQ sauce which took away from the taste of the actual pizza itself. When one orders a pizza, one expects a tomato or white sauce, not BBQ sauce as the main ingredient. The sauce made the pizza almost sickeningly sweet and we had to throw over half of it away. Will never order from this place again.

Review: I have been waiting to try this place for so long, but they're closed on Mondays when I'm usually free. Finally hit them up on another weekday evening and it was fire! I called ahead 15 mins to place a take out order. The interior is veryyy small so I'd suggest you order for take out. They allow you to do 2 different flavors on a pizza so we tried the Korean Bbq and the naga habanero chicken. I loved that they ask how spicy you want the naga habanero to be and it's legit spicy so beware! The Korean bbq imo just tasted like American bbq sauce but it was still good. My favorite was the naga habanero. I would come back and order the naga plus a new flavor to try!

Review: I am picky when it comes to pizza and that's because I have tried a lot! This is hands down the best pizza I have had in DFW. I recently moved to Plano and found them on UberEats. AMAZING. I've order at least 10 times now in the past few months. If you love a rich sweet red wine sauce, this is the pizza place for you. My only complaint is not being able to order on UberEats until after 3 pm but it's probably because they're so busy making that sauce with love that it takes a little more time. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: I was so excited to find out about this place and my first pizza which was simply the beef pepperoni and cheese was great! I have to admit in full disclosure that I am a very picky pizza eater being from the NYC area originally. I love a thin crispy crust and have always been a fan of beef pepperoni on a pizza. We were so excited, we thought finally we have found a great pizza place! Unfortunately, the next two pizzas that I ordered were totally different from the first one that I received. Exact same order other than I added additional beef pepperoni. But on the second two, the crust wasn't crispy and it was hard to believe that these had come from the same place that I had gotten the same pizza from just a week earlier. It was just OK and for the price I paid for six slices of pizza and the large size. I know that unfortunately I will still be looking for a great thin crispy crust pizza. My hopes were high, but unfortunately, the consistency was not there. With the number of people in West Plano that are from the east coast it seems unbelievable that we can't get great pizza in this area.

Review: Easily the most innovative pizza I've ever tried. Very tasty, recommended, we'll be back for more.

They were very happy to have us sample some of the different sauces as well.

Review: This isn't your typical pizza place. They have mostly exotic style pizza. Way too expensive imo. We got the traditional pepperoni, which was good for $10. Unfortunately, they charge $17. No way! We also got a weird specialty pizza and it wasn't even edible. The owner was very nice and even gave us a free pizza, knowing the one we got was a required taste. So he recommended the taco pizza. At first bite, it reminded me nothing of a taco but the ingredients were similar. It was spicy /5/10 and pretty tasty. But again, $23, way too expensive and not even for their largest pizza

 WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR: unique flavored pizzas. It's NYC style pizza with a Bangladeshi fusion, I didn't know what to choose!
 THE VIBE: just a quick grab & go place!
 PRICE: ~$20 (I can't remember but it was great pricing) 
 WOULD I COME BACK? Yes!

Overall Rating: 10/10 
- I have become a huge pizza fan after discovering @saucebrosusa  and their employee is the sweetest!
- This pizza is PACKED with AUTHENTIC flavor you cannot find anywhere else especially on a pizza! I was so surprised the beef taco side tasted like authentic Mexican street tacos especially with that spicy green sauce. 
- The nago habanero line (they have chicken, paneer, etc) is basically Desi food on top of pizza and it is actually the best combination ever. The spice level is top tier 
- I cannot wait to go back and order more of their flavors!

Review: Damn that Naga Chicken Pizza is sooo yummm!! Yes, it's spicy hence the mild version but it was delicious! Great NY style pizza, with a tasty crust and the ingredients all tasted super fresh. The owner is super friendly and really cares about making sure customers are happy with his pizza. 

Can't wait to try the other pizzas! I'll be back soon!

Review: I had a truly amazing experience with SauceBros -- while they didn't quite have what I was originally looking for, the pizza I ended up with was delicious and packed with flavor.

Aside from a fantastic flavor profile on their pizza, the staff (especially the owner) went above and beyond to make my order and my visit successful. It's  not often that you get treated to such great hospitality.

Looking forward to my next experience!

Review: I tried this place because it had so many good reviews. Where I think I went wrong was ordering a cheese pizza like a build your own because I was craving pepperoni, mushroom, jalapeño pizza.SauceBros has a lot of specialty pizzas and I should have started off with one of those. My pizza was good, but I have had better. I wish there would have been more pepperonis and the jalapeños were very small. Also, I ordered via Grubhub which took 40 extra mins. My second mistake. By the time it got here, it was cold. I will have to try this place again, but will go there in person and try something that they are known for off their menu.

Review: Amazing thin crust pizzas with classic and unique flavors. Tried cheese with honey, naga chicken, pepperoni and naga mushroom. All 4 were absolutely mindblowingly delicious. Definitely coming back for more. I wish the owners would expand to downtown Dallas as a second location so I can get my fix more easily.

Review: After hearing about the pizza from here from multiple people I finally gave this place a shot. I definitely recommend it, as the pizza flavors are innovative and delicious. 8.5/10 for me. The vibes inside are that of a typical small pizza joint, and really added to the experience for me.
----
We got the Bongo Tex Mex with ranch on the side. The Alfredo sauce really tied everything together and the beef was juicy and delicious. The only complaint we had was there was a bit too much grease, which made it a bit soggy as the crust was also quite thin.

Rating: 2 stars
Review: I went here for the first time based upon the reviews.

I got the meat lovers and it was nothing special. I am not sure why this place is so popular. Price was also expensive as they don't have small sizes. They sell pizzas only in 14 and 16 inches. Also, if you order online, they charge you extra fees for that. Not sure who does that. 

I am not sure if I will go back again or not.

Review: I really wanted to like this place as the owners were so nice, but that's not the case. I ordered 2 pizzas recently (meat lovers and basic cheese) and they were so inedible that we each ate one piece and literally threw away over $50 worth of pizza. The crust was fine, but nothing special. The cheese pizza crust was burnt on the bottom. I don't mind a little char from the ovens, but this went beyond that.
Worst part is the lack of sauce. It was almost undetectable. You would think with the name "sauce" in their name that that wouldn't be an issue. Worst part was the cheese and toppings. The sausage and pepperoni tasted off and the meat lovers seemed burnt on the top. The cheese didn't taste like a typical pizza cheese either. I honestly don't know how you would mess up a pizza that bad, but none of us could stomach another slice.
Maybe it was just an off day for this place, but I am truly baffled by the great reviews. I also might have given them a little grace had the pizza not been so expensive as well as the nearly $5 in fees extra fees added to the online order through their website. I would not have tipped had I noticed the extra fees in the order already.

Review: Phenomenal NY-Style pizza!

Second time coming here and one of the best NY Style Pie's in the city! Added bonus that the Beef Pepperoni is halal and much tastier than what I've had at other places.

Sauce was slightly too sweet this time but it seems that it was a one-off issue, as it generally has been a hit in the past.

Review: I visited this place last week and I was pleasantly surprised! My older son wanted a pizza and he wanted something different from the typical cheese and pepperoni pizza flavors. I searched Yelp and found this place and I am glad I did. We ordered the Shrimp Naga pizza and the Chicken Naga pizza. The guy who took my order over the phone was very friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us when we asked to have spicy sauce on the side for the spicy lovers in our group. He even walked the pizza out to our car when we arrived to pick it up. He told us more about the pizza and how he came up with the toppings for the two pizzas. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure.  

Nevertheless the pizzas were hot and delicious! The Naga sauce is very tasty, was sweet, spicy, and tangy, truly amazing! It's definitely a must try. The only thing I would change would be to add red onions to the Spicy Naga Chicken, I will add it as a topping next time bc it compliments the flavor profile so well. Unfortunately, my kids dug in as soon as I drove off so I don't have any pictures to share! I will definitely get some on the next visit. I'd love to have this place in my neighborhood!

Review: Decided to check out this place after seeing all the rave reviews and photos. Was not disappointed! The ordering process was quick and easy, and the pizza was ready within 10-15 minutes. The owners said every meat item on their menu is hand slaughtered halal, so that's an extra plus. Since we couldn't decide which specialty pizza to try first, we decided to do an X-Large (16-in) half and half with 1/2 Spicy Chicken Naga and 1/2 Meat Lovers.

The Spicy Naga Chicken Pizza tastes like a really good butter chicken pizza but with a little extra kick to it, and the Meat Lovers pizza is also packed with flavor in every bite and theres a generous amount of meat spread throughout! For as much meat and sauce as there was in the pizza, fortunately it wasn't too greasy and you won't end up feeling bloated or like you're having a GERD episode afterwards.

If you enjoy a NY thin crust style pizza or lots of flavor, this place will be right up your alley. If you're a "pizza snob" who watches the One Bite pizza reviews, there's a great amount of flavor and crisp in each bite, and I'd recommend waiting a few minutes before digging in so that you experience a stronger undercarriage and less flop with all the sauces and toppings these pizzas hold.

Had a chance to speak with one of the owners as well, and they were super generous and you can tell that these dudes are super passionate about their pizza! Definitely plan on coming back here often to try out their other specialty pizzas.

Review: Recently tried this place for the first time. The owner  (I believe he was the owner) was very welcoming and helpful, he walked us thru the menu and provided more info and recommendations. The garlic ghee mushroom was my favorite, a lot of great flavor. Unfortunately the cheese pizza was underwhelming. I was expecting a classic cheese pizza but it was more like a margarita pizza.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Great pizza! The Naga sauce is actually spicy! And the garlic ghee mushroom hits the spot!
The texture of the dough is a little stiff, however the flavor of it is comparable to sourdough. They are really friendly when you pick up and the pizzas are ready pretty fast! 
Definitely worth the try, and if you have to... the drive!

Review: After reading it was one of the best Pizzas 2023 we decided to visit.  I had searched for the top pizza places in Plano for dining in. This was not only NOT a dine-in pizza place it was one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. The dough was tough and rubbery.  The sauce was scant and there was a different cheese not a traditional delicious mozzarella but something else that was just awful.  We had the vegetarian pizza. 

Ambiance was non existent. 

You placed your order through a kiosk sitting on a stand.  They still had the nerve to request a tip. Lol.

Review: Sauce bros is fantastic. My bf and I ordered takeout for the first time yesterday and both pizzas were great. Love the fusion concept. They do an amazing job of blending NY pizza with flavors from Bangladesh. We both love Indian food so this was a no brainer for us. Great job guys! Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the large beef pepperoni + jalapeños and large naga chicken in medium. 

I wish I took pics but we just devoured them. Crust was fantastic. Pepperoni was great and we loved that they have beef options as my bf is Muslim and doesn't eat pork. So that was really nice bc we never can get pepperoni anywhere. The naga chicken za was the real star imo. Medium had a decent kick to it so be aware they aren't playing if you don't like spice! It was perfect for us. Definitely check them out! They do have seating inside but it's warm so I think takeout is best! Will be back again next time we want pizza and try the harissa chicken!

My husband is a big pizza fan and he enjoyed the crust and dough. He said it reminded him of Papa John's. I'd highly recommend! They have side dishes and pasta as well. The wings looked yummy too! The service was amazing- they offered complimentary drinks while we waited for our pizza and answered all our questions! Our wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad at all. It's small inside, so not a lot of room to eat, but they do have stools and two small tables. Definitely will be back!

Review: Thats a tasty pie!
The owner Red is a good dude- he was able to sneak me in front of a massive SuperBowl order so I was able to pick up a piping hot pizza in 15 minutes. 

Just added SauceBros to the top of my pizza list after polishing off a XL Spicy Naga Chicken. Probably the best pizza I have had in Plano. 

Super thin, perfect dough/crust and the flavor is a 10/10. 

Will be back soon to try some other toppings.

Prices were a little high but understandable,  as they offer halal meats.

Highly recommend.

Review: If you're looking for good pizza, but something different, then come here. They got cheese and meat lovers, but they also have interesting Indian/Middle Eastern topped pizzas, that once you try, will be a new favorite. The crust is also very good. You can tell by the bite and chew that they let this rise and proof for some time. They have a mural of Portnoy, who is infamous for eating and rating pizza. If I were him, I'd give this place a solid 86.9 on the scale. It's better than all the chain places, but it's not the best I've ever had. SauceBros' edge is being different than what you'd usually find and when I want something different I'll come here.

I called ahead 15 mins to place a take out order. The interior is veryyy small so I'd suggest you order for take out. They allow you to do 2 different flavors on a pizza so we tried the Korean Bbq and the naga habanero chicken. I loved that they ask how spicy you want the naga habanero to be and it's legit spicy so beware! The Korean bbq imo just tasted like American bbq sauce but it was still good. My favorite was the naga habanero. I would come back and order the naga plus a new flavor to try!

Review: I am picky when it comes to pizza and that's because I have tried a lot! This is hands down the best pizza I have had in DFW. I recently moved to Plano and found them on UberEats. AMAZING. I've order at least 10 times now in the past few months. If you love a rich sweet red wine sauce, this is the pizza place for you. My only complaint is not being able to order on UberEats until after 3 pm but it's probably because they're so busy making that sauce with love that it takes a little more time. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Review: I was so excited to find out about this place and my first pizza which was simply the beef pepperoni and cheese was great! I have to admit in full disclosure that I am a very picky pizza eater being from the NYC area originally. I love a thin crispy crust and have always been a fan of beef pepperoni on a pizza. We were so excited, we thought finally we have found a great pizza place! Unfortunately, the next two pizzas that I ordered were totally different from the first one that I received. Exact same order other than I added additional beef pepperoni. But on the second two, the crust wasn't crispy and it was hard to believe that these had come from the same place that I had gotten the same pizza from just a week earlier. It was just OK and for the price I paid for six slices of pizza and the large size. I know that unfortunately I will still be looking for a great thin crispy crust pizza. My hopes were high, but unfortunately, the consistency was not there. With the number of people in West Plano that are from the east coast it seems unbelievable that we can't get great pizza in this area.

Review: Easily the most innovative pizza I've ever tried. Very tasty, recommended, we'll be back for more.

They were very happy to have us sample some of the different sauces as well.

Review: This isn't your typical pizza place. They have mostly exotic style pizza. Way too expensive imo. We got the traditional pepperoni, which was good for $10. Unfortunately, they charge $17. No way! We also got a weird specialty pizza and it wasn't even edible. The owner was very nice and even gave us a free pizza, knowing the one we got was a required taste. So he recommended the taco pizza. At first bite, it reminded me nothing of a taco but the ingredients were similar. It was spicy /5/10 and pretty tasty. But again, $23, way too expensive and not even for their largest pizza

 WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR: unique flavored pizzas. It's NYC style pizza with a Bangladeshi fusion, I didn't know what to choose!
 THE VIBE: just a quick grab & go place!
 PRICE: ~$20 (I can't remember but it was great pricing) 
 WOULD I COME BACK? Yes!

Overall Rating: 10/10 
- I have become a huge pizza fan after discovering @saucebrosusa  and their employee is the sweetest!
- This pizza is PACKED with AUTHENTIC flavor you cannot find anywhere else especially on a pizza! I was so surprised the beef taco side tasted like authentic Mexican street tacos especially with that spicy green sauce. 
- The nago habanero line (they have chicken, paneer, etc) is basically Desi food on top of pizza and it is actually the best combination ever. The spice level is top tier 
- I cannot wait to go back and order more of their flavors!

Review: Damn that Naga Chicken Pizza is sooo yummm!! Yes, it's spicy hence the mild version but it was delicious! Great NY style pizza, with a tasty crust and the ingredients all tasted super fresh. The owner is super friendly and really cares about making sure customers are happy with his pizza. 

Can't wait to try the other pizzas! I'll be back soon!

Review: I had a truly amazing experience with SauceBros -- while they didn't quite have what I was originally looking for, the pizza I ended up with was delicious and packed with flavor.

Aside from a fantastic flavor profile on their pizza, the staff (especially the owner) went above and beyond to make my order and my visit successful. It's  not often that you get treated to such great hospitality.

Looking forward to my next experience!

Review: I tried this place because it had so many good reviews. Where I think I went wrong was ordering a cheese pizza like a build your own because I was craving pepperoni, mushroom, jalapeño pizza.SauceBros has a lot of specialty pizzas and I should have started off with one of those. My pizza was good, but I have had better. I wish there would have been more pepperonis and the jalapeños were very small. Also, I ordered via Grubhub which took 40 extra mins. My second mistake. By the time it got here, it was cold. I will have to try this place again, but will go there in person and try something that they are known for off their menu.

Review: This spot combined my two favorite things, Korean bbq & pizza ! Also I ate the artichoke pizza which was out of this world amazing ! But if you do go here check out that Korean bbq pizza ! Restaurant was clean and service was nice and easy understanding.

Review: Amazing thin crust pizzas with classic and unique flavors. Tried cheese with honey, naga chicken, pepperoni and naga mushroom. All 4 were absolutely mindblowingly delicious. Definitely coming back for more. I wish the owners would expand to downtown Dallas as a second location so I can get my fix more easily.

Review: After hearing about the pizza from here from multiple people I finally gave this place a shot. I definitely recommend it, as the pizza flavors are innovative and delicious. 8.5/10 for me. The vibes inside are that of a typical small pizza joint, and really added to the experience for me.

We got the Bongo Tex Mex with ranch on the side. The Alfredo sauce really tied everything together and the beef was juicy and delicious. The only complaint we had was there was a bit too much grease, which made it a bit soggy as the crust was also quite thin.

Rating: 2 stars
Review: I went here for the first time based upon the reviews.

I got the meat lovers and it was nothing special. I am not sure why this place is so popular. Price was also expensive as they don't have small sizes. They sell pizzas only in 14 and 16 inches. Also, if you order online, they charge you extra fees for that. Not sure who does that. 

I am not sure if I will go back again or not.

Review: I really wanted to like this place as the owners were so nice, but that's not the case. I ordered 2 pizzas recently (meat lovers and basic cheese) and they were so inedible that we each ate one piece and literally threw away over $50 worth of pizza. The crust was fine, but nothing special. The cheese pizza crust was burnt on the bottom. I don't mind a little char from the ovens, but this went beyond that.
Worst part is the lack of sauce. It was almost undetectable. You would think with the name "sauce" in their name that that wouldn't be an issue. Worst part was the cheese and toppings. The sausage and pepperoni tasted off and the meat lovers seemed burnt on the top. The cheese didn't taste like a typical pizza cheese either. I honestly don't know how you would mess up a pizza that bad, but none of us could stomach another slice.
Maybe it was just an off day for this place, but I am truly baffled by the great reviews. I also might have given them a little grace had the pizza not been so expensive as well as the nearly $5 in fees extra fees added to the online order through their website. I would not have tipped had I noticed the extra fees in the order already.

Review: Phenomenal NY-Style pizza!

Second time coming here and one of the best NY Style Pie's in the city! Added bonus that the Beef Pepperoni is halal and much tastier than what I've had at other places.

Sauce was slightly too sweet this time but it seems that it was a one-off issue, as it generally has been a hit in the past.

Review: I visited this place last week and I was pleasantly surprised! My older son wanted a pizza and he wanted something different from the typical cheese and pepperoni pizza flavors. I searched Yelp and found this place and I am glad I did. We ordered the Shrimp Naga pizza and the Chicken Naga pizza. The guy who took my order over the phone was very friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us when we asked to have spicy sauce on the side for the spicy lovers in our group. He even walked the pizza out to our car when we arrived to pick it up. He told us more about the pizza and how he came up with the toppings for the two pizzas. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure.  

Nevertheless the pizzas were hot and delicious! The Naga sauce is very tasty, was sweet, spicy, and tangy, truly amazing! It's definitely a must try. The only thing I would change would be to add red onions to the Spicy Naga Chicken, I will add it as a topping next time bc it compliments the flavor profile so well. Unfortunately, my kids dug in as soon as I drove off so I don't have any pictures to share! I will definitely get some on the next visit. I'd love to have this place in my neighborhood!

Review: Decided to check out this place after seeing all the rave reviews and photos. Was not disappointed! The ordering process was quick and easy, and the pizza was ready within 10-15 minutes. The owners said every meat item on their menu is hand slaughtered halal, so that's an extra plus. Since we couldn't decide which specialty pizza to try first, we decided to do an X-Large (16-in) half and half with 1/2 Spicy Chicken Naga and 1/2 Meat Lovers.

The Spicy Naga Chicken Pizza tastes like a really good butter chicken pizza but with a little extra kick to it, and the Meat Lovers pizza is also packed with flavor in every bite and theres a generous amount of meat spread throughout! For as much meat and sauce as there was in the pizza, fortunately it wasn't too greasy and you won't end up feeling bloated or like you're having a GERD episode afterwards.

If you enjoy a NY thin crust style pizza or lots of flavor, this place will be right up your alley. If you're a "pizza snob" who watches the One Bite pizza reviews, there's a great amount of flavor and crisp in each bite, and I'd recommend waiting a few minutes before digging in so that you experience a stronger undercarriage and less flop with all the sauces and toppings these pizzas hold.

Had a chance to speak with one of the owners as well, and they were super generous and you can tell that these dudes are super passionate about their pizza! Definitely plan on coming back here often to try out their other specialty pizzas.

Review: Recently tried this place for the first time. The owner  (I believe he was the owner) was very welcoming and helpful, he walked us thru the menu and provided more info and recommendations. The garlic ghee mushroom was my favorite, a lot of great flavor. Unfortunately the cheese pizza was underwhelming. I was expecting a classic cheese pizza but it was more like a margarita pizza.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Great pizza! The Naga sauce is actually spicy! And the garlic ghee mushroom hits the spot!
The texture of the dough is a little stiff, however the flavor of it is comparable to sourdough. They are really friendly when you pick up and the pizzas are ready pretty fast! 
Definitely worth the try, and if you have to... the drive!

Review: After reading it was one of the best Pizzas 2023 we decided to visit.  I had searched for the top pizza places in Plano for dining in. This was not only NOT a dine-in pizza place it was one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. The dough was tough and rubbery.  The sauce was scant and there was a different cheese not a traditional delicious mozzarella but something else that was just awful.  We had the vegetarian pizza. 

Ambiance was non existent. 

You placed your order through a kiosk sitting on a stand.  They still had the nerve to request a tip. Lol.

Review: Sauce bros is fantastic. My bf and I ordered takeout for the first time yesterday and both pizzas were great. Love the fusion concept. They do an amazing job of blending NY pizza with flavors from Bangladesh. We both love Indian food so this was a no brainer for us. Great job guys! Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the large beef pepperoni + jalapeños and large naga chicken in medium. 

I wish I took pics but we just devoured them. Crust was fantastic. Pepperoni was great and we loved that they have beef options as my bf is Muslim and doesn't eat pork. So that was really nice bc we never can get pepperoni anywhere. The naga chicken za was the real star imo. Medium had a decent kick to it so be aware they aren't playing if you don't like spice! It was perfect for us. Definitely check them out! They do have seating inside but it's warm so I think takeout is best! Will be back again next time we want pizza and try the harissa chicken!

Review: Half Spicy naga chicken pizza & pesto beef jhura, not pictured the hot honey cheese pizza. Every bite is filled with so much flavor! My favorite is the spicy naga chicken pizza, (if you look SPICY spicy this one is IT).

Review: Tried this on a whim for dinner! We ordered the Naga Habanero Chicken, medium spicy. We loved it! Was so delicious and flavorful. My husband is a big pizza fan and he enjoyed the crust and dough. He said it reminded him of Papa John's. I'd highly recommend! They have side dishes and pasta as well. The wings looked yummy too! The service was amazing- they offered complimentary drinks while we waited for our pizza and answered all our questions! Our wait time was about 15 minutes, not bad at all. It's small inside, so not a lot of room to eat, but they do have stools and two small tables. Definitely will be back!

Review: Thats a tasty pie!
The owner Red is a good dude- he was able to sneak me in front of a massive SuperBowl order so I was able to pick up a piping hot pizza in 15 minutes. 

Just added SauceBros to the top of my pizza list after polishing off a XL Spicy Naga Chicken. Probably the best pizza I have had in Plano. 

Super thin, perfect dough/crust and the flavor is a 10/10. 

Will be back soon to try some other toppings.

Review: Had the garlic ghee mushroom,  added onion and got a side of HOT HONEY! 
Thin crust, good ratio of ingredients. 

Pick up, not much dining area. Quick, on time, very friendly service. Nice gentlemen helped me select a great pizza, over the phone.

4 star pizza
5 star service

Prices were a little high but understandable,  as they offer halal meats. 

If you are a pizza lover and like interesting pizza choices, you'll love this little spot. Not your ordinary selections. 

Highly recommend.

Review: Taste was decent, but the portion to cost is way off. I e only ordered here once and they got the order wrong, the pizza was a pepperoni 14" for $20! Way over priced considering you can get a 16" at Taverna Rosa for $18 loaded.

Review: If you're looking for good pizza, but something different, then come here. They got cheese and meat lovers, but they also have interesting Indian/Middle Eastern topped pizzas, that once you try, will be a new favorite. The crust is also very good. You can tell by the bite and chew that they let this rise and proof for some time. They have a mural of Portnoy, who is infamous for eating and rating pizza. If I were him, I'd give this place a solid 86.9 on the scale. It's better than all the chain places, but it's not the best I've ever had. SauceBros' edge is being different than what you'd usually find and when I want something different I'll come here.

Review: Excited to try this place based on reviews and their menu offering some unique pies. This is definitely a take out spot -  small location, a counter and a few stools. The beef pepperoni was good, would love if more basil added. For the Spicy Nagy Chicken had requested cilantro on the side but that was missed. And there was a lot and it's a no go for my other half.  The owner offered to remake "them". I came back fifteen minutes later, they remade the Nagy but not the pepperoni. Ideal to have both fresh and ultimately just a miscommunication. He ended up refunding the order which I didn't think was necessary but was a kind gesture. I really liked the Spicy Nagy - the cilantro makes it!  They ask how spicy you want the habanero sauce on the Nagy. We chose most spicy but it was pretty tame. Wonder if we actually got the spiciest!  Great crust!!!  We look forward to trying additional items

Review: We were just looking for a random new pizza place and this one came up.

I was intrigued by the Indian fusion pizzas so we ordered a couple of those. When we got there, the owner and his wife greeted us and were some of the friendliest owners I've ever met! Their customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back!

For the pizza, we tried their garlic ghee mushroom pizza and their beer pesto pizza. Both were incredible flavor bombs! On top of that, their dough was just the perfect amount of crispy without being too chewy or cutting the roof of my mouth! Excited to go back and try more!

Amazing pizza, perfect amount of cheese, sauce and meat. You can tell the veggies were fresh! The employees were so nice and accommodating!

The owner Red was very nice and kept the little one busy while mom and dad ate. Thank you for a great experience!

Review: Super yummy pizza! Owners were kind and brought the pizza out to my car which was great on this pregnant ladies swollen feet. Ordered the chicken Bianca and it was ready in about 12 mins, loved that. The guys offered me a free drink while I waited which was so thoughtful on a 109 degree day. The sauce was great but the crust was really the stand out feature! It's hard to get me to cheat on Zalat but Sauce Bros actually has me excited to try them again and more of their flavors!! 5/5 stars!

Review: If I could give it any higher stars then I would. This place is awesome! Full of flavors. We were visiting Dallas and found this gem. 

The owner is from NYC so he gets it--pizza is all about the sauce and the dough. The sauce here an the dough are amazing. I am from NYC so I know pizza as well and I'd highly recommend their pizza. I had the Naga chicken Pizza and Jhura beef. It was good so two days later we ordered it again. I eat halal meat only and this place has halal pizza with desi flavors. If you like spicy then this is the place! I just loved it. 

Also, the owner is a great guy. So hospitable. He gave us tons of recommendation for good Dallas  area restaurants.

Review: Just moved to Dallas last month and we've been on the hunt for the best halal pizza spot. Tried SauceBros for the first time tonight and they did not disappoint!
