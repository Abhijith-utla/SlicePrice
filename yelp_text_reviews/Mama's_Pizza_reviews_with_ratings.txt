Review: We are from OKC and our pizza is pretty legit... This location was near the hotel we were staying and near the Walmart market store we shopped at .. so we gave it a try.
Cool throwback decor!!!
Greeted from a smiling staff member that explained all our questions. Including information on Togo slices!!! Wow this place is doing things right!!!

(Took Togo back to hotel staff... They were very pleased)

Mama's did a great job for dinner..
Got out cups and filled drinks  Drinks were kept on full. Pizzas came out /hot/fresh and tasty!!!

My beer was ice cold.

I recommend the cheese sticks and cinnamon rolls for must haves. The salad bar was fresh and tasty.. has me wanting to return when in the area!! 

Decently fast prepping of the food and the rest of the staff was super friendly! I was very pleased with our visit!

We will return when in the area!

Thanks for taking care of dinner on this Sunday evening as we got in the area for a 3 night stay!

Review: I was highly disappointed in Mama's Pizza strictly due to the pizza options. They only offered four pizzas at a time, but you can put in a request. The salad bar was bigger than the pizza warmer! $10 for all-you-can-eat. It is slight more expensive than Cici's and slightly better as well. The floors were really dirty and sticky so be careful walking back and forth. Oh, don't forget to try the cinnamon rolls. They weren't bad.

Review: We love Mama's  pizza.  It's the best pizza around to us.  We like it best take out only.    They seem to make much better pizzas to go than for the buffet. 
It is a buffet so the service is mainly at the counter but they are always friendly and efficient. 
The restaurant itself seems a little on the dark side for my taste but some would probably find it cozy.

Review: So, we used to head to the Mama's location, when we lived in Mansfield, it was always a great experience, so when we stumbled across a location here in Plano, we absolutely took a drive. The main difference is the Plano location offers their buffet at dinner as well as lunch,

Okay, the summary version is this:
1. The dining room is bigger than it looks from outside.
2. The parking lot and the entryway are small (and a bit of a pit of bottlenecks)
3. The service area for the buffet is too tight and congested.
4. Their pizza is fresh, delicious, and real. You won't find a buffet of child-focused option with nothing for an adult palette. (I refrain from naming names).
5. The salad bar is fresh with plenty of options.
6. Their creamy Italian dressing!!!!! 'Nuff said.
7. Fist-sized cinnamon rolls go really fast when they come up so be prepared.

The only item we did not like was their pasta sauce on the buffet. It was too thick and garlicky for our tastes. I do suspect it had been up there long enough to reduce and over- concentrate.

They offer their buffet at lunch and dinner, so give it a try. They also do a pretty darn good take out business. Give the little guy a shot here!

Really like their creamy italian. Most of the pizza selection is great. They will make what you want if you ask for it. There is a new Pizza Inn with all day buffet near where i live and it was no comparison to Mama's, and it cost few dollars more.
Gina the hostess is always super friendly and always remembers you. She will help in anyway if you need something. Entire staff is great!

Review: Pizza is always undercooked. I call to try and help them and the manager just gets short and hangs up.  Sad too.  This is a high end area w $2mil houses and lots of potential customers but they don't care.  Started out pretty good but now it just kinda sucks.  Fratelli and Campisi is a lot better.  2 stars bc the ingredients are good just poorly prepared and undercooked by 5-10min.  Sad for a $40 pizza.

Review: Went for the pizza buffet with the kids. Salad bar was a little lacking but it had the basics. The pizza selection varies as they are constantly bringing out different pies and pastas. They were all good but not "fantastic". Since it was a buffet there wasn't service per se, but the staff kept the food stocked and the cashier was very nice. 
As far as pizza buffets go, the ambiance was on par with what you'd expect. Parking was a bit difficult at lunchtime but adequate. Overall I'd say it was good but not great.

Review: Went to plano original location for dinner buffet. Only a few pizzas are served at a time but they kept on coming. Crust is surprisingly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Cinnamon buns are just rightly sweetened. This location which have been here for so long seems to have stood the test of time. Can't beat the price and the good Pizzas.
Also tried the Fort Worth location, but plano location quality is still better.

Review: The perfect hub of delicious pizza and pure nostalgia. As a fan of buffets, Mama's is one of the few places left post-Covid that gives you the pure enjoyment of returning to your table with plates piled to your hearts content. The wait for a fresh slice is never long, and even on the busiest evenings, the staff is cheerful and swift with their works. I've been to this place a ton since I was a kid, and the old timey mood is the piece de resistance for this restaurant. The arcade cabinet and candy machines add to the ambience of the joint, making it the perfect place for families of all sizes and ages. Even when you're full to the brim of salad, pizza, and cheesy bread-no evening is completed without a warm, buttery cinnamon roll. Their buffet deal is perfectly priced-and the food hits the spot whenever I happen to drop by. Mama's pizza, you'll always be my favorite pizza place!

Review: I have lived in Texas for 45 years. When we were younger we got all of our pizzas from Mamas in Carrollton,  it was exciting, like a huge treat.I never have been to this one all this time, so I was so excited and then so disappointed. The salad bar made Cici's look amazing. I was excited they had whole boiled eggs...that probably had been boiled for 30 minites..They would probably be great as bouncing balls. I then got 2 breadsticks and 2 slices of pizza. I used over 6 napkins to sop up the grease, still had maybe 4 bites, also everything was so salty..Then I thought I would give 1 last effort to "the amazing cinnamon rolls" it tasted like a Grands cinnamon roll on steroids. So yes I hate giving negative reviews. Oh and the sweet lady who busts her butt clearing the dishes. People leave her a small tip, for your 10 plates on the table.

Review: I've been ordering pizza from Mamma's since 1980 and currently drive 45 min round trip to pick my pizzas up.  No more.  Some may blame Covid, supply chain, inflation, labor shortages for the skimpy use of ingredients that made a Mamma's pizza stand out from all others but the problems are deeper.   Slicing a 20" pizza in 2.5" slices is ridiculous.   Was ice cold pizza by the time we got home.   I gave Mamma's too much time I guess, picked it up early even.   They told me the pizza had anchovies on the whole pizza...was only intended for half...there were none on the pizza.

That's it.   No reason ever to go to Mamma's.   I hope they change back to what made them great.   It was gross.   They will go out of business if management doesn't step in at some point soon.

Review: Brought a friend for the buffet since I haven't been here since I retired (just in time before covid!). The pizza was just as good as I remembered. Very good.  And the salad was good - very fresh & crisp lettuce, lots to add and the wonderful ranch dressing. I splurged & had the cinnamon roll too. We went about 11:15 before it got too crowded. It was an enjoyable trip & I'm so glad we went. They sure work hard to keep the pizzas coming, the salad bar refilled and keeping the cinnamon rolls available. Customers were good about waiting in line - good thing as I would have hit someone with a plate if they tried to reach across me. I went back a few times but, well, it was just good.

YT FAMILY FRIENDLY definitely not the latter.  WE WILL NEVER BRING OUR FAMILY HERE AGAIN.

Review: I've been coming to Mama's Pizza since I moved to Plano from San Diego  in 2005. I usually go to Buffett and they have a salad bar(I really like the salad bar, they have a good one), different kind of pizza, cheese bread, tomato sauce, pasta and cinnamon rolls. They now have a lunch Buffett, I think from 11am to 2pm. I went there about 1pm and it wasn't too packed. They didn't have a veggie pizza out there, so I had cheese bread with tomato sauce and ranch dressing from the salad bar and they were delicious!!! It's just a great, friendly place to eat in my neighborhood and I like to support the local business.

Review: It's been a minute since I've eaten at Mama's pizza and decided to stop in and eat with my husband for lunch. As usual the staff was friendly, the price reasonable, and the food delicious! I grew up in Plano and this was the spot during lunch time and on weekends. I've been on a Keto diet for almost 6 months now with absolutely NO bread during this time but decided to enjoy myself and have a few slices. It was absolutely worth it and was everything I knew it would be. I LOVE the salad bar here and they are one of the few places that offer creamy Italian dressing!

Review: If you like pizza buffets and want a break from CiCi's, check out Mama's! 

It has that 80's/ 90's feel to it. It seems like that place you went as a kid or in high school and those memories come back when you go as an adult. (I had a pizza place like this in New Orleans but I'm here now and I get that same vibe)

You're able to make requests for pizza that you want! The slices are cut small so that you're able to sample other pizzas without wasting food. 

There's a salad bar, pasta bar, pizza and dessert (cinnamon rolls). Unlimited soda refills and an old school arcade game for the kids. 

TIP: Bring a handful of quarters if you have kids. They have those gum ball/ prize machines where you inert quarters. I promise your kids rarely see this and it's cool to see their reaction when they use it! 

The door is great and the prices are even greater. It's a great night out alone, on a date (not a first date!!!) or with family/ friends. You can feed everyone and not break the bank. 

Check it out!

Review: The staff is friendly but the people that eat here are very judgmental me and my boyfriend are black every time he got up I notice multiple heads turn from old white people and as well when I get up people would stare me down as if I'm supposed to be scared of them first time coming it will be my last due to the people here I felt judged just by eating

Review: We've only talked about coming here for the 15+ years we've lived in Plano. This is definitely a hometown favorite. Why? All-you-can-eat buffet that's reasonably priced and tasty food. At $6.95 per adult, you really can't go wrong and the constant flow of families testifies they've found the right price point for what's on offer.

You can fill up on a very fresh salad bar (though I wish the hard boiled egg was sliced or chopped instead of being whole boiled eggs ... a little odd). Or head straight to the pizza. Lots of topping choices, but all pizzas are on original-style crust (no thin crust options). That's ok, too, you just need to know that and maybe go somewhere else if you are a thin crust lover. You can also get marinara and cheese sticks, but make sure you save room for the cinnamon rolls.

I'd read lots of reviews about the cinnamon rolls and every one of them praised them. Trust the reviews. The rolls are something special.

Other plus factors: You can buy beer (Shiner and Deep Ellum are among the choices!), or get water or soda. Plenty of high chairs to grab and seat the littles.

The space is small so you'll do some crawling between tables and wait in pinch points to get to the salad or the pizza lines. But you know what? Everyone is so darn nice that it's just not a big deal at all. 

We'll definitely be back.

Review: My daughter and I are originally from Arlington. Mama's Pizza in Arlington was our go to pizza. It's been around for years! We moved to Frisco and we miss our pizza place. Then my daughter found out there is one in Plano so we went the next night. Omg it was absolutely delicious. So happy to have a pizza place we love so close. Now if we could just get a Dino's in Frisco!! That would be Heaven!!

Review: Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly busy. The buffet line is small and can get congested quickly. They were a bit slow to put out hot pizzas. I feel like the options were more limited that previous visits. The pizza tasted fine and the salad bar was okay. The tables could have been cleaner. The cinnamon rolls only taste good hot! I will say that they can accommodate larger groups!

Review: Mamas Pizza is AMAZING!! I've been going there since I was a child and I highly recommend!! The dinner buffet is awesome but it's still worth the visit at lunch!! The pizzas are amazing and there's a great amount of pizza sizes and topping options. They also have a salad bar which is pretty darn cool. The pizza crust is really good too. Im picky about crust so I don't always eat pizza crust but Mamas Pizza pizza crust has the perfect amount of butter to make your mouth water for more. Always great pizza any time I go, never disappointed

Review: I know...shows like 10 years between visits...well it's not been 10 years, and sometimes...I don't always check in.  My bad!  haha.

Mama's Pizza is a Plano staple!  Unfortunately, COVID-19 has stopped their buffet...but not their pizza!  Ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 black olives and all mushroom tonight.  It is very good, and will continue into tomorrow for lunch.  haha.

Why not 5 stars?  well...the pizza is good and the staff is great.  but is the pizza 5 star great?  maybe 4.3?  Anyways, it's good, try them out.  Prices are very reasonable and as I mentioned, the staff is great!

Parking can get tight when busy, other businesses in the area too.

Review: It was difficult to leave San Diego and move to Dallas. However, I'm happy to be living in a place that offers some buffet options (even though Dallas doesn't seem to have as many as I expected).

During our first night in Dallas, "constant companion" found Mama's Pizza while he was looking for a buffet. He sold me on it when he said that it was around $7/person. I'm still in reverse sticker shock from California prices, so this seemed insane to me.

We came here on a Sunday night, which turned out to be the perfect time. It wasn't too busy but it was busy enough for them to have a constant supply of fresh pizzas. I heard them call out a lot of different topping variations while we were sitting in our booth. Some people complained on other reviews that they have a small selection, but I think it's a good idea to only have four pizzas out at a time. They stay fresh. The worst thing about pizza buffet is old pizza, and they avoid that at Mama's.

Besides being fresh, the pizza is pretty good (for buffet). I don't think I'd order any of the pizzas on their own, but I did really enjoy the pretzel like crust. It was tasty!

They also have a salad bar, pasta with marinara, cheesy bread, and cinnamon rolls. I was very happy with the selection. 

The place was clean and the food was good. Those are two things that I can't say about Cici's, which everyone seems to compare to Mama's. When you compare them, it's really no contest though. I compel you to choose Mama's. You'll thank me afterwards.

They told me the pizza had anchovies on the whole pizza...was only intended for half...there were none on the pizza.

That's it.   No reason ever to go to Mamma's.   I hope they change back to what made them great.   It was gross.   They will go out of business if management doesn't step in at some point soon.

Review: Brought a friend for the buffet since I haven't been here since I retired (just in time before covid!). The pizza was just as good as I remembered. Very good.  And the salad was good - very fresh & crisp lettuce, lots to add and the wonderful ranch dressing. I splurged & had the cinnamon roll too. We went about 11:15 before it got too crowded. It was an enjoyable trip & I'm so glad we went. They sure work hard to keep the pizzas coming, the salad bar refilled and keeping the cinnamon rolls available. Customers were good about waiting in line - good thing as I would have hit someone with a plate if they tried to reach across me. I went back a few times but, well, it was just good.

Review: I've been coming to Mama's Pizza since I moved to Plano from San Diego  in 2005. I usually go to Buffett and they have a salad bar(I really like the salad bar, they have a good one), different kind of pizza, cheese bread, tomato sauce, pasta and cinnamon rolls. They now have a lunch Buffett, I think from 11am to 2pm. I went there about 1pm and it wasn't too packed. They didn't have a veggie pizza out there, so I had cheese bread with tomato sauce and ranch dressing from the salad bar and they were delicious!!! It's just a great, friendly place to eat in my neighborhood and I like to support the local business.

Review: It's been a minute since I've eaten at Mama's pizza and decided to stop in and eat with my husband for lunch. As usual the staff was friendly, the price reasonable, and the food delicious! I grew up in Plano and this was the spot during lunch time and on weekends. I've been on a Keto diet for almost 6 months now with absolutely NO bread during this time but decided to enjoy myself and have a few slices. It was absolutely worth it and was everything I knew it would be. I LOVE the salad bar here and they are one of the few places that offer creamy Italian dressing!

Review: If you like pizza buffets and want a break from CiCi's, check out Mama's! 

It has that 80's/ 90's feel to it. It seems like that place you went as a kid or in high school and those memories come back when you go as an adult. (I had a pizza place like this in New Orleans but I'm here now and I get that same vibe)

You're able to make requests for pizza that you want! The slices are cut small so that you're able to sample other pizzas without wasting food. 

There's a salad bar, pasta bar, pizza and dessert (cinnamon rolls). Unlimited soda refills and an old school arcade game for the kids. 

TIP: Bring a handful of quarters if you have kids. They have those gum ball/ prize machines where you inert quarters. I promise your kids rarely see this and it's cool to see their reaction when they use it! 

The door is great and the prices are even greater. It's a great night out alone, on a date (not a first date!!!) or with family/ friends. You can feed everyone and not break the bank. 

Check it out!

Review: We've only talked about coming here for the 15+ years we've lived in Plano. This is definitely a hometown favorite. Why? All-you-can-eat buffet that's reasonably priced and tasty food. At $6.95 per adult, you really can't go wrong and the constant flow of families testifies they've found the right price point for what's on offer.

You can fill up on a very fresh salad bar (though I wish the hard boiled egg was sliced or chopped instead of being whole boiled eggs ... a little odd). Or head straight to the pizza. Lots of topping choices, but all pizzas are on original-style crust (no thin crust options). That's ok, too, you just need to know that and maybe go somewhere else if you are a thin crust lover. You can also get marinara and cheese sticks, but make sure you save room for the cinnamon rolls.

I'd read lots of reviews about the cinnamon rolls and every one of them praised them. Trust the reviews. The rolls are something special.

Other plus factors: You can buy beer (Shiner and Deep Ellum are among the choices!), or get water or soda. Plenty of high chairs to grab and seat the littles.

The space is small so you'll do some crawling between tables and wait in pinch points to get to the salad or the pizza lines. But you know what? Everyone is so darn nice that it's just not a big deal at all. 

We'll definitely be back.

Review: My daughter and I are originally from Arlington. Mama's Pizza in Arlington was our go to pizza. It's been around for years! We moved to Frisco and we miss our pizza place.

Review: Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly busy. The buffet line is small and can get congested quickly. They were a bit slow to put out hot pizzas. I feel like the options were more limited that previous visits. The pizza tasted fine and the salad bar was okay. The tables could have been cleaner. The cinnamon rolls only taste good hot! I will say that they can accommodate larger groups!

Review: Mamas Pizza is AMAZING!! I've been going there since I was a child and I highly recommend!! The dinner buffet is awesome but it's still worth the visit at lunch!! The pizzas are amazing and there's a great amount of pizza sizes and topping options. They also have a salad bar which is pretty darn cool. The pizza crust is really good too. Im picky about crust so I don't always eat pizza crust but Mamas Pizza pizza crust has the perfect amount of butter to make your mouth water for more. Always great pizza any time I go, never disappointed

Review: I know...shows like 10 years between visits...well it's not been 10 years, and sometimes...I don't always check in.  My bad!  haha.

Mama's Pizza is a Plano staple!  Unfortunately, COVID-19 has stopped their buffet...but not their pizza!  Ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 black olives and all mushroom tonight.  It is very good, and will continue into tomorrow for lunch.  haha.

Why not 5 stars?  well...the pizza is good and the staff is great.  but is the pizza 5 star great?  maybe 4.3?  Anyways, it's good, try them out.  Prices are very reasonable and as I mentioned, the staff is great!

Parking can get tight when busy, other businesses in the area too.

Review: It was difficult to leave San Diego and move to Dallas. However, I'm happy to be living in a place that offers some buffet options (even though Dallas doesn't seem to have as many as I expected).

During our first night in Dallas, "constant companion" found Mama's Pizza while he was looking for a buffet. He sold me on it when he said that it was around $7/person. I'm still in reverse sticker shock from California prices, so this seemed insane to me.

We came here on a Sunday night, which turned out to be the perfect time. It wasn't too busy but it was busy enough for them to have a constant supply of fresh pizzas. I heard them call out a lot of different topping variations while we were sitting in our booth. Some people complained on other reviews that they have a small selection, but I think it's a good idea to only have four pizzas out at a time. They stay fresh. The worst thing about pizza buffet is old pizza, and they avoid that at Mama's.

Besides being fresh, the pizza is pretty good (for buffet). I don't think I'd order any of the pizzas on their own, but I did really enjoy the pretzel like crust. It was tasty!

They also have a salad bar, pasta with marinara, cheesy bread, and cinnamon rolls. I was very happy with the selection. 

The place was clean and the food was good. Those are two things that I can't say about Cici's, which everyone seems to compare to Mama's. When you compare them, it's really no contest though. I compel you to choose Mama's. You'll thank me afterwards.

Review: We are from OKC and our pizza is pretty legit... This location was near the hotel we were staying and near the Walmart market store we shopped at .. so we gave it a try.
Cool throwback decor!!!
Greeted from a smiling staff member that explained all our questions. Including information on Togo slices!!! Wow this place is doing things right!!!

(Took Togo back to hotel staff... They were very pleased)

Mama's did a great job for dinner..
Got out cups and filled drinks  Drinks were kept on full. Pizzas came out /hot/fresh and tasty!!!

My beer was ice cold.

I recommend the cheese sticks and cinnamon rolls for must haves. The salad bar was fresh and tasty.. has me wanting to return when in the area!! 

Decently fast prepping of the food and the rest of the staff was super friendly! I was very pleased with our visit!

We will return when in the area!

Thanks for taking care of dinner on this Sunday evening as we got in the area for a 3 night stay!

Review: I was highly disappointed in Mama's Pizza strictly due to the pizza options. They only offered four pizzas at a time, but you can put in a request. The salad bar was bigger than the pizza warmer! $10 for all-you-can-eat. It is slight more expensive than Cici's and slightly better as well. The floors were really dirty and sticky so be careful walking back and forth. Oh, don't forget to try the cinnamon rolls. They weren't bad.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: We love Mama's  pizza.  It's the best pizza around to us.  We like it best take out only.    They seem to make much better pizzas to go than for the buffet. 
It is a buffet so the service is mainly at the counter but they are always friendly and efficient. 
The restaurant itself seems a little on the dark side for my taste but some would probably find it cozy.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: So, we used to head to the Mama's location, when we lived in Mansfield, it was always a great experience, so when we stumbled across a location here in Plano, we absolutely took a drive. The main difference is the Plano location offers their buffet at dinner as well as lunch,

Okay, the summary version is this:
1. The dining room is bigger than it looks from outside.
2. The parking lot and the entryway are small (and a bit of a pit of bottlenecks)
3. The service area for the buffet is too tight and congested.
4. Their pizza is fresh, delicious, and real. You won't find a buffet of child-focused option with nothing for an adult palette. (I refrain from naming names).
5. The salad bar is fresh with plenty of options.
6. Their creamy Italian dressing!!!!! 'Nuff said.
7. Fist-sized cinnamon rolls go really fast when they come up so be prepared.

The only item we did not like was their pasta sauce on the buffet. It was too thick and garlicky for our tastes. I do suspect it had been up there long enough to reduce and over- concentrate.

They offer their buffet at lunch and dinner, so give it a try. They also do a pretty darn good take out business. Give the little guy a shot here!

Review: Imo, the best pizza buffet for the money, period! Great, fresh salad bar with real salad dressing, not the waterdown version you sometimes get at other places. Really like their creamy italian. Most of the pizza selection is great. They will make what you want if you ask for it. There is a new Pizza Inn with all day buffet near where i live and it was no comparison to Mama's, and it cost few dollars more.
Gina the hostess is always super friendly and always remembers you. She will help in anyway if you need something. Entire staff is great!

Review: Pizza is always undercooked. I call to try and help them and the manager just gets short and hangs up.  Sad too.  This is a high end area w $2mil houses and lots of potential customers but they don't care.  Started out pretty good but now it just kinda sucks.  Fratelli and Campisi is a lot better.  2 stars bc the ingredients are good just poorly prepared and undercooked by 5-10min.  Sad for a $40 pizza.

Review: Went for the pizza buffet with the kids. Salad bar was a little lacking but it had the basics. The pizza selection varies as they are constantly bringing out different pies and pastas. They were all good but not "fantastic". Since it was a buffet there wasn't service per se, but the staff kept the food stocked and the cashier was very nice. 
As far as pizza buffets go, the ambiance was on par with what you'd expect. Parking was a bit difficult at lunchtime but adequate. Overall I'd say it was good but not great.

Review: Went to plano original location for dinner buffet. Only a few pizzas are served at a time but they kept on coming. Crust is surprisingly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Cinnamon buns are just rightly sweetened. This location which have been here for so long seems to have stood the test of time. Can't beat the price and the good Pizzas.
Also tried the Fort Worth location, but plano location quality is still better.

Review: The perfect hub of delicious pizza and pure nostalgia. As a fan of buffets, Mama's is one of the few places left post-Covid that gives you the pure enjoyment of returning to your table with plates piled to your hearts content. The wait for a fresh slice is never long, and even on the busiest evenings, the staff is cheerful and swift with their works. I've been to this place a ton since I was a kid, and the old timey mood is the piece de resistance for this restaurant. The arcade cabinet and candy machines add to the ambience of the joint, making it the perfect place for families of all sizes and ages. Even when you're full to the brim of salad, pizza, and cheesy bread-no evening is completed without a warm, buttery cinnamon roll. Their buffet deal is perfectly priced-and the food hits the spot whenever I happen to drop by. Mama's pizza, you'll always be my favorite pizza place!

Review: I have lived in Texas for 45 years. When we were younger we got all of our pizzas from Mamas in Carrollton,  it was exciting, like a huge treat.I never have been to this one all this time, so I was so excited and then so disappointed. The salad bar made Cici's look amazing. I was excited they had whole boiled eggs...that probably had been boiled for 30 minites..They would probably be great as bouncing balls. I then got 2 breadsticks and 2 slices of pizza. I used over 6 napkins to sop up the grease, still had maybe 4 bites, also everything was so salty..Then I thought I would give 1 last effort to "the amazing cinnamon rolls" it tasted like a Grands cinnamon roll on steroids. So yes I hate giving negative reviews. Oh and the sweet lady who busts her butt clearing the dishes. People leave her a small tip, for your 10 plates on the table.

Some people complained on other reviews that they have a small selection, but I think it's a good idea to only have four pizzas out at a time. They stay fresh. The worst thing about pizza buffet is old pizza, and they avoid that at Mama's.

Besides being fresh, the pizza is pretty good (for buffet). I don't think I'd order any of the pizzas on their own, but I did really enjoy the pretzel like crust. It was tasty!

They also have a salad bar, pasta with marinara, cheesy bread, and cinnamon rolls. I was very happy with the selection. 

The place was clean and the food was good. Those are two things that I can't say about Cici's, which everyone seems to compare to Mama's. When you compare them, it's really no contest though. I compel you to choose Mama's. You'll thank me afterwards.

Review: We are from OKC and our pizza is pretty legit... This location was near the hotel we were staying and near the Walmart market store we shopped at .. so we gave it a try.
Cool throwback decor!!!
Greeted from a smiling staff member that explained all our questions. Including information on Togo slices!!! Wow this place is doing things right!!!

(Took Togo back to hotel staff... They were very pleased)

Mama's did a great job for dinner..
Got out cups and filled drinks  Drinks were kept on full. Pizzas came out /hot/fresh and tasty!!!

My beer was ice cold.

I recommend the cheese sticks and cinnamon rolls for must haves. The salad bar was fresh and tasty.. has me wanting to return when in the area!! 

Decently fast prepping of the food and the rest of the staff was super friendly! I was very pleased with our visit!

We will return when in the area!

Thanks for taking care of dinner on this Sunday evening as we got in the area for a 3 night stay!

Review: I was highly disappointed in Mama's Pizza strictly due to the pizza options. They only offered four pizzas at a time, but you can put in a request. The salad bar was bigger than the pizza warmer! $10 for all-you-can-eat. It is slight more expensive than Cici's and slightly better as well. The floors were really dirty and sticky so be careful walking back and forth. Oh, don't forget to try the cinnamon rolls. They weren't bad.

Review: We love Mama's  pizza.  It's the best pizza around to us.  We like it best take out only.    They seem to make much better pizzas to go than for the buffet. 
It is a buffet so the service is mainly at the counter but they are always friendly and efficient. 
The restaurant itself seems a little on the dark side for my taste but some would probably find it cozy.

Review: So, we used to head to the Mama's location, when we lived in Mansfield, it was always a great experience, so when we stumbled across a location here in Plano, we absolutely took a drive. The main difference is the Plano location offers their buffet at dinner as well as lunch,

Okay, the summary version is this:
1. The dining room is bigger than it looks from outside.
2. The parking lot and the entryway are small (and a bit of a pit of bottlenecks)
3. The service area for the buffet is too tight and congested.
4. Their pizza is fresh, delicious, and real. You won't find a buffet of child-focused option with nothing for an adult palette. (I refrain from naming names).
5. The salad bar is fresh with plenty of options.
6. Their creamy Italian dressing!!!!! 'Nuff said.
7. Fist-sized cinnamon rolls go really fast when they come up so be prepared.

The only item we did not like was their pasta sauce on the buffet. It was too thick and garlicky for our tastes. I do suspect it had been up there long enough to reduce and over- concentrate.

They offer their buffet at lunch and dinner, so give it a try. They also do a pretty darn good take out business. Give the little guy a shot here!

There is a new Pizza Inn with all day buffet near where i live and it was no comparison to Mama's, and it cost few dollars more.

Review: Pizza is always undercooked. I call to try and help them and the manager just gets short and hangs up.  Sad too.  This is a high end area w $2mil houses and lots of potential customers but they don't care.  Started out pretty good but now it just kinda sucks.  Fratelli and Campisi is a lot better.  2 stars bc the ingredients are good just poorly prepared and undercooked by 5-10min.  Sad for a $40 pizza.

Review: Went for the pizza buffet with the kids. Salad bar was a little lacking but it had the basics. The pizza selection varies as they are constantly bringing out different pies and pastas. They were all good but not "fantastic". Since it was a buffet there wasn't service per se, but the staff kept the food stocked and the cashier was very nice. 
As far as pizza buffets go, the ambiance was on par with what you'd expect. Parking was a bit difficult at lunchtime but adequate. Overall I'd say it was good but not great.

Review: Went to plano original location for dinner buffet. Only a few pizzas are served at a time but they kept on coming. Crust is surprisingly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Cinnamon buns are just rightly sweetened. This location which have been here for so long seems to have stood the test of time. Can't beat the price and the good Pizzas.
Also tried the Fort Worth location, but plano location quality is still better.

Review: The perfect hub of delicious pizza and pure nostalgia. As a fan of buffets, Mama's is one of the few places left post-Covid that gives you the pure enjoyment of returning to your table with plates piled to your hearts content. The wait for a fresh slice is never long, and even on the busiest evenings, the staff is cheerful and swift with their works. I've been to this place a ton since I was a kid, and the old timey mood is the piece de resistance for this restaurant. The arcade cabinet and candy machines add to the ambience of the joint, making it the perfect place for families of all sizes and ages. Even when you're full to the brim of salad, pizza, and cheesy bread-no evening is completed without a warm, buttery cinnamon roll. Their buffet deal is perfectly priced-and the food hits the spot whenever I happen to drop by. Mama's pizza, you'll always be my favorite pizza place!

Review: I have lived in Texas for 45 years. When we were younger we got all of our pizzas from Mamas in Carrollton,  it was exciting, like a huge treat.I never have been to this one all this time, so I was so excited and then so disappointed. The salad bar made Cici's look amazing. I was excited they had whole boiled eggs...that probably had been boiled for 30 minites..They would probably be great as bouncing balls. I then got 2 breadsticks and 2 slices of pizza. I used over 6 napkins to sop up the grease, still had maybe 4 bites, also everything was so salty..Then I thought I would give 1 last effort to "the amazing cinnamon rolls" it tasted like a Grands cinnamon roll on steroids. So yes I hate giving negative reviews. Oh and the sweet lady who busts her butt clearing the dishes. People leave her a small tip, for your 10 plates on the table.

Review: I've been ordering pizza from Mamma's since 1980 and currently drive 45 min round trip to pick my pizzas up.  No more.  Some may blame Covid, supply chain, inflation, labor shortages for the skimpy use of ingredients that made a Mamma's pizza stand out from all others but the problems are deeper.   Slicing a 20" pizza in 2.5" slices is ridiculous.   Was ice cold pizza by the time we got home.   I gave Mamma's too much time I guess, picked it up early even.   They told me the pizza had anchovies on the whole pizza...was only intended for half...there were none on the pizza.

That's it.   No reason ever to go to Mamma's.   I hope they change back to what made them great.   It was gross.   They will go out of business if management doesn't step in at some point soon.

Review: Brought a friend for the buffet since I haven't been here since I retired (just in time before covid!). The pizza was just as good as I remembered. Very good.  And the salad was good - very fresh & crisp lettuce, lots to add and the wonderful ranch dressing. I splurged & had the cinnamon roll too. We went about 11:15 before it got too crowded. It was an enjoyable trip & I'm so glad we went. They sure work hard to keep the pizzas coming, the salad bar refilled and keeping the cinnamon rolls available. Customers were good about waiting in line - good thing as I would have hit someone with a plate if they tried to reach across me. I went back a few times but, well, it was just good.

YT FAMILY FRIENDLY definitely not the latter.  WE WILL NEVER BRING OUR FAMILY HERE AGAIN.

Review: I've been coming to Mama's Pizza since I moved to Plano from San Diego  in 2005. I usually go to Buffett and they have a salad bar(I really like the salad bar, they have a good one), different kind of pizza, cheese bread, tomato sauce, pasta and cinnamon rolls. They now have a lunch Buffett, I think from 11am to 2pm. I went there about 1pm and it wasn't too packed. They didn't have a veggie pizza out there, so I had cheese bread with tomato sauce and ranch dressing from the salad bar and they were delicious!!! It's just a great, friendly place to eat in my neighborhood and I like to support the local business.

Review: It's been a minute since I've eaten at Mama's pizza and decided to stop in and eat with my husband for lunch. As usual the staff was friendly, the price reasonable, and the food delicious! I grew up in Plano and this was the spot during lunch time and on weekends. I've been on a Keto diet for almost 6 months now with absolutely NO bread during this time but decided to enjoy myself and have a few slices. It was absolutely worth it and was everything I knew it would be. I LOVE the salad bar here and they are one of the few places that offer creamy Italian dressing!

Review: If you like pizza buffets and want a break from CiCi's, check out Mama's! 

It has that 80's/ 90's feel to it. It seems like that place you went as a kid or in high school and those memories come back when you go as an adult. (I had a pizza place like this in New Orleans but I'm here now and I get that same vibe)

You're able to make requests for pizza that you want! The slices are cut small so that you're able to sample other pizzas without wasting food. 

There's a salad bar, pasta bar, pizza and dessert (cinnamon rolls). Unlimited soda refills and an old school arcade game for the kids. 

TIP: Bring a handful of quarters if you have kids. They have those gum ball/ prize machines where you inert quarters. I promise your kids rarely see this and it's cool to see their reaction when they use it! 

The door is great and the prices are even greater. It's a great night out alone, on a date (not a first date!!!) or with family/ friends. You can feed everyone and not break the bank. 

Check it out!

Review: The staff is friendly but the people that eat here are very judgmental me and my boyfriend are black every time he got up I notice multiple heads turn from old white people and as well when I get up people would stare me down as if I'm supposed to be scared of them first time coming it will be my last due to the people here I felt judged just by eating

Review: We've only talked about coming here for the 15+ years we've lived in Plano. This is definitely a hometown favorite. Why? All-you-can-eat buffet that's reasonably priced and tasty food. At $6.95 per adult, you really can't go wrong and the constant flow of families testifies they've found the right price point for what's on offer.

You can fill up on a very fresh salad bar (though I wish the hard boiled egg was sliced or chopped instead of being whole boiled eggs ... a little odd). Or head straight to the pizza. Lots of topping choices, but all pizzas are on original-style crust (no thin crust options). That's ok, too, you just need to know that and maybe go somewhere else if you are a thin crust lover. You can also get marinara and cheese sticks, but make sure you save room for the cinnamon rolls.

I'd read lots of reviews about the cinnamon rolls and every one of them praised them. Trust the reviews. The rolls are something special.

Other plus factors: You can buy beer (Shiner and Deep Ellum are among the choices!), or get water or soda. Plenty of high chairs to grab and seat the littles.

The space is small so you'll do some crawling between tables and wait in pinch points to get to the salad or the pizza lines. But you know what? Everyone is so darn nice that it's just not a big deal at all. 

We'll definitely be back.

Review: My daughter and I are originally from Arlington. Mama's Pizza in Arlington was our go to pizza. It's been around for years! We moved to Frisco and we miss our pizza place. Then my daughter found out there is one in Plano so we went the next night. Omg it was absolutely delicious. So happy to have a pizza place we love so close. Now if we could just get a Dino's in Frisco!! That would be Heaven!!

Review: Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly busy. The buffet line is small and can get congested quickly. They were a bit slow to put out hot pizzas. I feel like the options were more limited that previous visits. The pizza tasted fine and the salad bar was okay. The tables could have been cleaner. The cinnamon rolls only taste good hot! I will say that they can accommodate larger groups!

The pizzas are amazing and there's a great amount of pizza sizes and topping options. They also have a salad bar which is pretty darn cool. The pizza crust is really good too. Im picky about crust so I don't always eat pizza crust but Mamas Pizza pizza crust has the perfect amount of butter to make your mouth water for more. Always great pizza any time I go, never disappointed

Review: I know...shows like 10 years between visits...well it's not been 10 years, and sometimes...I don't always check in.  My bad!  haha.

Mama's Pizza is a Plano staple!  Unfortunately, COVID-19 has stopped their buffet...but not their pizza!  Ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 black olives and all mushroom tonight.  It is very good, and will continue into tomorrow for lunch.  haha.

Why not 5 stars?  well...the pizza is good and the staff is great.  but is the pizza 5 star great?  maybe 4.3?  Anyways, it's good, try them out.  Prices are very reasonable and as I mentioned, the staff is great!

Parking can get tight when busy, other businesses in the area too.

Review: It was difficult to leave San Diego and move to Dallas. However, I'm happy to be living in a place that offers some buffet options (even though Dallas doesn't seem to have as many as I expected).

During our first night in Dallas, "constant companion" found Mama's Pizza while he was looking for a buffet. He sold me on it when he said that it was around $7/person. I'm still in reverse sticker shock from California prices, so this seemed insane to me.

We came here on a Sunday night, which turned out to be the perfect time. It wasn't too busy but it was busy enough for them to have a constant supply of fresh pizzas. I heard them call out a lot of different topping variations while we were sitting in our booth. Some people complained on other reviews that they have a small selection, but I think it's a good idea to only have four pizzas out at a time. They stay fresh.

I then got 2 breadsticks and 2 slices of pizza. I used over 6 napkins to sop up the grease, still had maybe 4 bites, also everything was so salty..Then I thought I would give 1 last effort to "the amazing cinnamon rolls" it tasted like a Grands cinnamon roll on steroids. So yes I hate giving negative reviews. Oh and the sweet lady who busts her butt clearing the dishes. People leave her a small tip, for your 10 plates on the table.

Review: I've been ordering pizza from Mamma's since 1980 and currently drive 45 min round trip to pick my pizzas up.  No more.  Some may blame Covid, supply chain, inflation, labor shortages for the skimpy use of ingredients that made a Mamma's pizza stand out from all others but the problems are deeper.   Slicing a 20" pizza in 2.5" slices is ridiculous.   Was ice cold pizza by the time we got home.   I gave Mamma's too much time I guess, picked it up early even.   They told me the pizza had anchovies on the whole pizza...was only intended for half...there were none on the pizza.

That's it.   No reason ever to go to Mamma's.   I hope they change back to what made them great.   It was gross.   They will go out of business if management doesn't step in at some point soon.

Review: Brought a friend for the buffet since I haven't been here since I retired (just in time before covid!). The pizza was just as good as I remembered. Very good.  And the salad was good - very fresh & crisp lettuce, lots to add and the wonderful ranch dressing. I splurged & had the cinnamon roll too. We went about 11:15 before it got too crowded. It was an enjoyable trip & I'm so glad we went. They sure work hard to keep the pizzas coming, the salad bar refilled and keeping the cinnamon rolls available. Customers were good about waiting in line - good thing as I would have hit someone with a plate if they tried to reach across me. I went back a few times but, well, it was just good.

Review: I've been coming to Mama's Pizza since I moved to Plano from San Diego  in 2005. I usually go to Buffett and they have a salad bar(I really like the salad bar, they have a good one), different kind of pizza, cheese bread, tomato sauce, pasta and cinnamon rolls. They now have a lunch Buffett, I think from 11am to 2pm. I went there about 1pm and it wasn't too packed. They didn't have a veggie pizza out there, so I had cheese bread with tomato sauce and ranch dressing from the salad bar and they were delicious!!! It's just a great, friendly place to eat in my neighborhood and I like to support the local business.

Review: It's been a minute since I've eaten at Mama's pizza and decided to stop in and eat with my husband for lunch. As usual the staff was friendly, the price reasonable, and the food delicious! I grew up in Plano and this was the spot during lunch time and on weekends. I've been on a Keto diet for almost 6 months now with absolutely NO bread during this time but decided to enjoy myself and have a few slices. It was absolutely worth it and was everything I knew it would be. I LOVE the salad bar here and they are one of the few places that offer creamy Italian dressing!

Review: If you like pizza buffets and want a break from CiCi's, check out Mama's! 

It has that 80's/ 90's feel to it. It seems like that place you went as a kid or in high school and those memories come back when you go as an adult. (I had a pizza place like this in New Orleans but I'm here now and I get that same vibe)

You're able to make requests for pizza that you want! The slices are cut small so that you're able to sample other pizzas without wasting food. 

There's a salad bar, pasta bar, pizza and dessert (cinnamon rolls). Unlimited soda refills and an old school arcade game for the kids. 

TIP: Bring a handful of quarters if you have kids. They have those gum ball/ prize machines where you inert quarters. I promise your kids rarely see this and it's cool to see their reaction when they use it! 

The door is great and the prices are even greater. It's a great night out alone, on a date (not a first date!!!) or with family/ friends. You can feed everyone and not break the bank. 

Check it out!

Review: We've only talked about coming here for the 15+ years we've lived in Plano. This is definitely a hometown favorite. Why? All-you-can-eat buffet that's reasonably priced and tasty food. At $6.95 per adult, you really can't go wrong and the constant flow of families testifies they've found the right price point for what's on offer.

You can fill up on a very fresh salad bar (though I wish the hard boiled egg was sliced or chopped instead of being whole boiled eggs ... a little odd). Or head straight to the pizza. Lots of topping choices, but all pizzas are on original-style crust (no thin crust options). That's ok, too, you just need to know that and maybe go somewhere else if you are a thin crust lover. You can also get marinara and cheese sticks, but make sure you save room for the cinnamon rolls.

I'd read lots of reviews about the cinnamon rolls and every one of them praised them. Trust the reviews. The rolls are something special.

Other plus factors: You can buy beer (Shiner and Deep Ellum are among the choices!), or get water or soda. Plenty of high chairs to grab and seat the littles.

The space is small so you'll do some crawling between tables and wait in pinch points to get to the salad or the pizza lines. But you know what? Everyone is so darn nice that it's just not a big deal at all. 

We'll definitely be back.

Review: My daughter and I are originally from Arlington. Mama's Pizza in Arlington was our go to pizza. It's been around for years! We moved to Frisco and we miss our pizza place. Then my daughter found out there is one in Plano so we went the next night. Omg it was absolutely delicious. So happy to have a pizza place we love so close. Now if we could just get a Dino's in Frisco!! That would be Heaven!!

Review: Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly busy. The buffet line is small and can get congested quickly. They were a bit slow to put out hot pizzas. I feel like the options were more limited that previous visits. The pizza tasted fine and the salad bar was okay. The tables could have been cleaner. The cinnamon rolls only taste good hot! I will say that they can accommodate larger groups!

Review: Mamas Pizza is AMAZING!! I've been going there since I was a child and I highly recommend!! The dinner buffet is awesome but it's still worth the visit at lunch!! The pizzas are amazing and there's a great amount of pizza sizes and topping options. They also have a salad bar which is pretty darn cool. The pizza crust is really good too. Im picky about crust so I don't always eat pizza crust but Mamas Pizza pizza crust has the perfect amount of butter to make your mouth water for more. Always great pizza any time I go, never disappointed

Review: I know...shows like 10 years between visits...well it's not been 10 years, and sometimes...I don't always check in.  My bad!  haha.

Mama's Pizza is a Plano staple!  Unfortunately, COVID-19 has stopped their buffet...but not their pizza!  Ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 black olives and all mushroom tonight.  It is very good, and will continue into tomorrow for lunch.  haha.

Why not 5 stars?  well...the pizza is good and the staff is great.  but is the pizza 5 star great?  maybe 4.3?  Anyways, it's good, try them out.  Prices are very reasonable and as I mentioned, the staff is great!

Parking can get tight when busy, other businesses in the area too.

Review: It was difficult to leave San Diego and move to Dallas. However, I'm happy to be living in a place that offers some buffet options (even though Dallas doesn't seem to have as many as I expected).

During our first night in Dallas, "constant companion" found Mama's Pizza while he was looking for a buffet. He sold me on it when he said that it was around $7/person. I'm still in reverse sticker shock from California prices, so this seemed insane to me.

We came here on a Sunday night, which turned out to be the perfect time. It wasn't too busy but it was busy enough for them to have a constant supply of fresh pizzas. I heard them call out a lot of different topping variations while we were sitting in our booth. Some people complained on other reviews that they have a small selection, but I think it's a good idea to only have four pizzas out at a time. They stay fresh. The worst thing about pizza buffet is old pizza, and they avoid that at Mama's.

Besides being fresh, the pizza is pretty good (for buffet). I don't think I'd order any of the pizzas on their own, but I did really enjoy the pretzel like crust. It was tasty!

They also have a salad bar, pasta with marinara, cheesy bread, and cinnamon rolls. I was very happy with the selection. 

The place was clean and the food was good. Those are two things that I can't say about Cici's, which everyone seems to compare to Mama's. When you compare them, it's really no contest though. I compel you to choose Mama's. You'll thank me afterwards.

Review: We are from OKC and our pizza is pretty legit... This location was near the hotel we were staying and near the Walmart market store we shopped at .. so we gave it a try.
Cool throwback decor!!!
Greeted from a smiling staff member that explained all our questions. Including information on Togo slices!!! Wow this place is doing things right!!!

(Took Togo back to hotel staff... They were very pleased)

Mama's did a great job for dinner..
Got out cups and filled drinks  Drinks were kept on full. Pizzas came out /hot/fresh and tasty!!!

My beer was ice cold.

I recommend the cheese sticks and cinnamon rolls for must haves. The salad bar was fresh and tasty.. has me wanting to return when in the area!! 

Decently fast prepping of the food and the rest of the staff was super friendly! I was very pleased with our visit!

We will return when in the area!

Thanks for taking care of dinner on this Sunday evening as we got in the area for a 3 night stay!

Review: I was highly disappointed in Mama's Pizza strictly due to the pizza options. They only offered four pizzas at a time, but you can put in a request. The salad bar was bigger than the pizza warmer! $10 for all-you-can-eat. It is slight more expensive than Cici's and slightly better as well. The floors were really dirty and sticky so be careful walking back and forth. Oh, don't forget to try the cinnamon rolls. They weren't bad.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: We love Mama's  pizza.  It's the best pizza around to us.  We like it best take out only.    They seem to make much better pizzas to go than for the buffet. 
It is a buffet so the service is mainly at the counter but they are always friendly and efficient. 
The restaurant itself seems a little on the dark side for my taste but some would probably find it cozy.

Review: So, we used to head to the Mama's location, when we lived in Mansfield, it was always a great experience, so when we stumbled across a location here in Plano, we absolutely took a drive. The main difference is the Plano location offers their buffet at dinner as well as lunch,

Okay, the summary version is this:
1. The dining room is bigger than it looks from outside.
2. The parking lot and the entryway are small (and a bit of a pit of bottlenecks)
3. The service area for the buffet is too tight and congested.
4. Their pizza is fresh, delicious, and real. You won't find a buffet of child-focused option with nothing for an adult palette. (I refrain from naming names).
5. The salad bar is fresh with plenty of options.
6. Their creamy Italian dressing!!!!! 'Nuff said.
7. Fist-sized cinnamon rolls go really fast when they come up so be prepared.

The only item we did not like was their pasta sauce on the buffet. It was too thick and garlicky for our tastes. I do suspect it had been up there long enough to reduce and over- concentrate.

They offer their buffet at lunch and dinner, so give it a try. They also do a pretty darn good take out business. Give the little guy a shot here!

Review: Imo, the best pizza buffet for the money, period! Great, fresh salad bar with real salad dressing, not the waterdown version you sometimes get at other places. Really like their creamy italian. Most of the pizza selection is great. They will make what you want if you ask for it. There is a new Pizza Inn with all day buffet near where i live and it was no comparison to Mama's, and it cost few dollars more.
Gina the hostess is always super friendly and always remembers you. She will help in anyway if you need something. Entire staff is great!

Review: Pizza is always undercooked. I call to try and help them and the manager just gets short and hangs up.  Sad too.  This is a high end area w $2mil houses and lots of potential customers but they don't care.  Started out pretty good but now it just kinda sucks.  Fratelli and Campisi is a lot better.  2 stars bc the ingredients are good just poorly prepared and undercooked by 5-10min.  Sad for a $40 pizza.

Review: Went for the pizza buffet with the kids. Salad bar was a little lacking but it had the basics. The pizza selection varies as they are constantly bringing out different pies and pastas. They were all good but not "fantastic". Since it was a buffet there wasn't service per se, but the staff kept the food stocked and the cashier was very nice. 
As far as pizza buffets go, the ambiance was on par with what you'd expect. Parking was a bit difficult at lunchtime but adequate. Overall I'd say it was good but not great.

Review: Went to plano original location for dinner buffet. Only a few pizzas are served at a time but they kept on coming. Crust is surprisingly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Cinnamon buns are just rightly sweetened. This location which have been here for so long seems to have stood the test of time. Can't beat the price and the good Pizzas.
Also tried the Fort Worth location, but plano location quality is still better.

Review: The perfect hub of delicious pizza and pure nostalgia. As a fan of buffets, Mama's is one of the few places left post-Covid that gives you the pure enjoyment of returning to your table with plates piled to your hearts content. The wait for a fresh slice is never long, and even on the busiest evenings, the staff is cheerful and swift with their works. I've been to this place a ton since I was a kid, and the old timey mood is the piece de resistance for this restaurant. The arcade cabinet and candy machines add to the ambience of the joint, making it the perfect place for families of all sizes and ages. Even when you're full to the brim of salad, pizza, and cheesy bread-no evening is completed without a warm, buttery cinnamon roll. Their buffet deal is perfectly priced-and the food hits the spot whenever I happen to drop by. Mama's pizza, you'll always be my favorite pizza place!

Review: They have the most incredible Buffet. And if they don't have what you want on buffet. Just ask them what you special order will be out in 7 to 10 minutes. Just enough time to eat their incredible salad bar.

Review: It was difficult to leave San Diego and move to Dallas. However, I'm happy to be living in a place that offers some buffet options (even though Dallas doesn't seem to have as many as I expected).

During our first night in Dallas, "constant companion" found Mama's Pizza while he was looking for a buffet. He sold me on it when he said that it was around $7/person. I'm still in reverse sticker shock from California prices, so this seemed insane to me.

We came here on a Sunday night, which turned out to be the perfect time. It wasn't too busy but it was busy enough for them to have a constant supply of fresh pizzas. I heard them call out a lot of different topping variations while we were sitting in our booth. Some people complained on other reviews that they have a small selection, but I think it's a good idea to only have four pizzas out at a time. They stay fresh. The worst thing about pizza buffet is old pizza, and they avoid that at Mama's.

Besides being fresh, the pizza is pretty good (for buffet). I don't think I'd order any of the pizzas on their own, but I did really enjoy the pretzel like crust. It was tasty!

They also have a salad bar, pasta with marinara, cheesy bread, and cinnamon rolls. I was very happy with the selection. 

The place was clean and the food was good. Those are two things that I can't say about Cici's, which everyone seems to compare to Mama's. When you compare them, it's really no contest though. I compel you to choose Mama's. You'll thank me afterwards.

Review: We are from OKC and our pizza is pretty legit... This location was near the hotel we were staying and near the Walmart market store we shopped at .. so we gave it a try.
Cool throwback decor!!!
Greeted from a smiling staff member that explained all our questions. Including information on Togo slices!!! Wow this place is doing things right!!!

(Took Togo back to hotel staff... They were very pleased)

Mama's did a great job for dinner..
Got out cups and filled drinks  Drinks were kept on full. Pizzas came out /hot/fresh and tasty!!!

My beer was ice cold.

I recommend the cheese sticks and cinnamon rolls for must haves. The salad bar was fresh and tasty.. has me wanting to return when in the area!! 

Decently fast prepping of the food and the rest of the staff was super friendly! I was very pleased with our visit!

We will return when in the area!

Thanks for taking care of dinner on this Sunday evening as we got in the area for a 3 night stay!

Review: I was highly disappointed in Mama's Pizza strictly due to the pizza options. They only offered four pizzas at a time, but you can put in a request. The salad bar was bigger than the pizza warmer! $10 for all-you-can-eat. It is slight more expensive than Cici's and slightly better as well. The floors were really dirty and sticky so be careful walking back and forth. Oh, don't forget to try the cinnamon rolls. They weren't bad.

Review: We love Mama's  pizza.  It's the best pizza around to us.  We like it best take out only.    They seem to make much better pizzas to go than for the buffet. 
It is a buffet so the service is mainly at the counter but they are always friendly and efficient. 
The restaurant itself seems a little on the dark side for my taste but some would probably find it cozy.

Review: So, we used to head to the Mama's location, when we lived in Mansfield, it was always a great experience, so when we stumbled across a location here in Plano, we absolutely took a drive. The main difference is the Plano location offers their buffet at dinner as well as lunch,

Okay, the summary version is this:
1. The dining room is bigger than it looks from outside.
2. The parking lot and the entryway are small (and a bit of a pit of bottlenecks)
3. The service area for the buffet is too tight and congested.
4. Their pizza is fresh, delicious, and real. You won't find a buffet of child-focused option with nothing for an adult palette. (I refrain from naming names).
5. The salad bar is fresh with plenty of options.
6. Their creamy Italian dressing!!!!! 'Nuff said.
7. Fist-sized cinnamon rolls go really fast when they come up so be prepared.

The only item we did not like was their pasta sauce on the buffet. It was too thick and garlicky for our tastes. I do suspect it had been up there long enough to reduce and over- concentrate.

They offer their buffet at lunch and dinner, so give it a try. They also do a pretty darn good take out business. Give the little guy a shot here!

There is a new Pizza Inn with all day buffet near where i live and it was no comparison to Mama's, and it cost few dollars more.

Review: Pizza is always undercooked. I call to try and help them and the manager just gets short and hangs up.  Sad too.  This is a high end area w $2mil houses and lots of potential customers but they don't care.  Started out pretty good but now it just kinda sucks.  Fratelli and Campisi is a lot better.  2 stars bc the ingredients are good just poorly prepared and undercooked by 5-10min.  Sad for a $40 pizza.

Also tried the Fort Worth location, but plano location quality is still better.

Review: The perfect hub of delicious pizza and pure nostalgia. As a fan of buffets, Mama's is one of the few places left post-Covid that gives you the pure enjoyment of returning to your table with plates piled to your hearts content. The wait for a fresh slice is never long, and even on the busiest evenings, the staff is cheerful and swift with their works. I've been to this place a ton since I was a kid, and the old timey mood is the piece de resistance for this restaurant. The arcade cabinet and candy machines add to the ambience of the joint, making it the perfect place for families of all sizes and ages. Even when you're full to the brim of salad, pizza, and cheesy bread-no evening is completed without a warm, buttery cinnamon roll. Their buffet deal is perfectly priced-and the food hits the spot whenever I happen to drop by. Mama's pizza, you'll always be my favorite pizza place!

Review: I have lived in Texas for 45 years. When we were younger we got all of our pizzas from Mamas in Carrollton,  it was exciting, like a huge treat.I never have been to this one all this time, so I was so excited and then so disappointed. The salad bar made Cici's look amazing. I was excited they had whole boiled eggs...that probably had been boiled for 30 minites..They would probably be great as bouncing balls. I then got 2 breadsticks and 2 slices of pizza. I used over 6 napkins to sop up the grease, still had maybe 4 bites, also everything was so salty..Then I thought I would give 1 last effort to "the amazing cinnamon rolls" it tasted like a Grands cinnamon roll on steroids. So yes I hate giving negative reviews. Oh and the sweet lady who busts her butt clearing the dishes. People leave her a small tip, for your 10 plates on the table.

Review: I've been ordering pizza from Mamma's since 1980 and currently drive 45 min round trip to pick my pizzas up.  No more.  Some may blame Covid, supply chain, inflation, labor shortages for the skimpy use of ingredients that made a Mamma's pizza stand out from all others but the problems are deeper.   Slicing a 20" pizza in 2.5" slices is ridiculous.   Was ice cold pizza by the time we got home.   I gave Mamma's too much time I guess, picked it up early even.   They told me the pizza had anchovies on the whole pizza...was only intended for half...there were none on the pizza.

That's it.   No reason ever to go to Mamma's.   I hope they change back to what made them great.   It was gross.   They will go out of business if management doesn't step in at some point soon.

Review: Brought a friend for the buffet since I haven't been here since I retired (just in time before covid!). The pizza was just as good as I remembered. Very good.  And the salad was good - very fresh & crisp lettuce, lots to add and the wonderful ranch dressing. I splurged & had the cinnamon roll too. We went about 11:15 before it got too crowded. It was an enjoyable trip & I'm so glad we went. They sure work hard to keep the pizzas coming, the salad bar refilled and keeping the cinnamon rolls available. Customers were good about waiting in line - good thing as I would have hit someone with a plate if they tried to reach across me. I went back a few times but, well, it was just good.

YT FAMILY FRIENDLY definitely not the latter.  WE WILL NEVER BRING OUR FAMILY HERE AGAIN.

Review: I've been coming to Mama's Pizza since I moved to Plano from San Diego  in 2005. I usually go to Buffett and they have a salad bar(I really like the salad bar, they have a good one), different kind of pizza, cheese bread, tomato sauce, pasta and cinnamon rolls. They now have a lunch Buffett, I think from 11am to 2pm. I went there about 1pm and it wasn't too packed. They didn't have a veggie pizza out there, so I had cheese bread with tomato sauce and ranch dressing from the salad bar and they were delicious!!! It's just a great, friendly place to eat in my neighborhood and I like to support the local business.

Review: It's been a minute since I've eaten at Mama's pizza and decided to stop in and eat with my husband for lunch. As usual the staff was friendly, the price reasonable, and the food delicious! I grew up in Plano and this was the spot during lunch time and on weekends. I've been on a Keto diet for almost 6 months now with absolutely NO bread during this time but decided to enjoy myself and have a few slices. It was absolutely worth it and was everything I knew it would be. I LOVE the salad bar here and they are one of the few places that offer creamy Italian dressing!

Review: If you like pizza buffets and want a break from CiCi's, check out Mama's! 

It has that 80's/ 90's feel to it. It seems like that place you went as a kid or in high school and those memories come back when you go as an adult. (I had a pizza place like this in New Orleans but I'm here now and I get that same vibe)

You're able to make requests for pizza that you want! The slices are cut small so that you're able to sample other pizzas without wasting food. 

There's a salad bar, pasta bar, pizza and dessert (cinnamon rolls). Unlimited soda refills and an old school arcade game for the kids. 

TIP: Bring a handful of quarters if you have kids. They have those gum ball/ prize machines where you inert quarters. I promise your kids rarely see this and it's cool to see their reaction when they use it! 

The door is great and the prices are even greater. It's a great night out alone, on a date (not a first date!!!) or with family/ friends. You can feed everyone and not break the bank. 

Check it out!

Review: The staff is friendly but the people that eat here are very judgmental me and my boyfriend are black every time he got up I notice multiple heads turn from old white people and as well when I get up people would stare me down as if I'm supposed to be scared of them first time coming it will be my last due to the people here I felt judged just by eating

Review: We've only talked about coming here for the 15+ years we've lived in Plano. This is definitely a hometown favorite. Why? All-you-can-eat buffet that's reasonably priced and tasty food. At $6.95 per adult, you really can't go wrong and the constant flow of families testifies they've found the right price point for what's on offer.

You can fill up on a very fresh salad bar (though I wish the hard boiled egg was sliced or chopped instead of being whole boiled eggs ... a little odd). Or head straight to the pizza. Lots of topping choices, but all pizzas are on original-style crust (no thin crust options). That's ok, too, you just need to know that and maybe go somewhere else if you are a thin crust lover. You can also get marinara and cheese sticks, but make sure you save room for the cinnamon rolls.

I'd read lots of reviews about the cinnamon rolls and every one of them praised them. Trust the reviews. The rolls are something special.

Other plus factors: You can buy beer (Shiner and Deep Ellum are among the choices!), or get water or soda. Plenty of high chairs to grab and seat the littles.

The space is small so you'll do some crawling between tables and wait in pinch points to get to the salad or the pizza lines. But you know what? Everyone is so darn nice that it's just not a big deal at all. 

We'll definitely be back.

Review: My daughter and I are originally from Arlington. Mama's Pizza in Arlington was our go to pizza. It's been around for years! We moved to Frisco and we miss our pizza place. Then my daughter found out there is one in Plano so we went the next night. Omg it was absolutely delicious. So happy to have a pizza place we love so close. Now if we could just get a Dino's in Frisco!! That would be Heaven!!

Review: Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly busy. The buffet line is small and can get congested quickly. They were a bit slow to put out hot pizzas.

I will say that they can accommodate larger groups!

The pizzas are amazing and there's a great amount of pizza sizes and topping options. They also have a salad bar which is pretty darn cool. The pizza crust is really good too. Im picky about crust so I don't always eat pizza crust but Mamas Pizza pizza crust has the perfect amount of butter to make your mouth water for more. Always great pizza any time I go, never disappointed

Review: I know...shows like 10 years between visits...well it's not been 10 years, and sometimes...I don't always check in.  My bad!  haha.

Mama's Pizza is a Plano staple!  Unfortunately, COVID-19 has stopped their buffet...but not their pizza!  Ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 black olives and all mushroom tonight.  It is very good, and will continue into tomorrow for lunch.  haha.

Why not 5 stars?  well...the pizza is good and the staff is great.  but is the pizza 5 star great?  maybe 4.3?  Anyways, it's good, try them out.  Prices are very reasonable and as I mentioned, the staff is great!

Review: I have lived in Texas for 45 years. When we were younger we got all of our pizzas from Mamas in Carrollton,  it was exciting, like a huge treat.I never have been to this one all this time, so I was so excited and then so disappointed. The salad bar made Cici's look amazing. I was excited they had whole boiled eggs...that probably had been boiled for 30 minites..They would probably be great as bouncing balls. I then got 2 breadsticks and 2 slices of pizza. I used over 6 napkins to sop up the grease, still had maybe 4 bites, also everything was so salty..Then I thought I would give 1 last effort to "the amazing cinnamon rolls" it tasted like a Grands cinnamon roll on steroids. So yes I hate giving negative reviews. Oh and the sweet lady who busts her butt clearing the dishes. People leave her a small tip, for your 10 plates on the table.

Review: I've been ordering pizza from Mamma's since 1980 and currently drive 45 min round trip to pick my pizzas up.  No more.  Some may blame Covid, supply chain, inflation, labor shortages for the skimpy use of ingredients that made a Mamma's pizza stand out from all others but the problems are deeper.   Slicing a 20" pizza in 2.5" slices is ridiculous.   Was ice cold pizza by the time we got home.   I gave Mamma's too much time I guess, picked it up early even.   They told me the pizza had anchovies on the whole pizza...was only intended for half...there were none on the pizza.

That's it.   No reason ever to go to Mamma's.   I hope they change back to what made them great.   It was gross.   They will go out of business if management doesn't step in at some point soon.

Review: Brought a friend for the buffet since I haven't been here since I retired (just in time before covid!). The pizza was just as good as I remembered. Very good.  And the salad was good - very fresh & crisp lettuce, lots to add and the wonderful ranch dressing. I splurged & had the cinnamon roll too. We went about 11:15 before it got too crowded. It was an enjoyable trip & I'm so glad we went. They sure work hard to keep the pizzas coming, the salad bar refilled and keeping the cinnamon rolls available. Customers were good about waiting in line - good thing as I would have hit someone with a plate if they tried to reach across me. I went back a few times but, well, it was just good.

Review: I've been coming to Mama's Pizza since I moved to Plano from San Diego  in 2005. I usually go to Buffett and they have a salad bar(I really like the salad bar, they have a good one), different kind of pizza, cheese bread, tomato sauce, pasta and cinnamon rolls. They now have a lunch Buffett, I think from 11am to 2pm. I went there about 1pm and it wasn't too packed. They didn't have a veggie pizza out there, so I had cheese bread with tomato sauce and ranch dressing from the salad bar and they were delicious!!! It's just a great, friendly place to eat in my neighborhood and I like to support the local business.

Review: It's been a minute since I've eaten at Mama's pizza and decided to stop in and eat with my husband for lunch. As usual the staff was friendly, the price reasonable, and the food delicious! I grew up in Plano and this was the spot during lunch time and on weekends. I've been on a Keto diet for almost 6 months now with absolutely NO bread during this time but decided to enjoy myself and have a few slices. It was absolutely worth it and was everything I knew it would be. I LOVE the salad bar here and they are one of the few places that offer creamy Italian dressing!

Review: If you like pizza buffets and want a break from CiCi's, check out Mama's! 

It has that 80's/ 90's feel to it. It seems like that place you went as a kid or in high school and those memories come back when you go as an adult. (I had a pizza place like this in New Orleans but I'm here now and I get that same vibe)

You're able to make requests for pizza that you want! The slices are cut small so that you're able to sample other pizzas without wasting food. 

There's a salad bar, pasta bar, pizza and dessert (cinnamon rolls). Unlimited soda refills and an old school arcade game for the kids. 

TIP: Bring a handful of quarters if you have kids. They have those gum ball/ prize machines where you inert quarters. I promise your kids rarely see this and it's cool to see their reaction when they use it! 

The door is great and the prices are even greater. It's a great night out alone, on a date (not a first date!!!) or with family/ friends. You can feed everyone and not break the bank. 

Check it out!

Review: We've only talked about coming here for the 15+ years we've lived in Plano. This is definitely a hometown favorite. Why? All-you-can-eat buffet that's reasonably priced and tasty food. At $6.95 per adult, you really can't go wrong and the constant flow of families testifies they've found the right price point for what's on offer.

You can fill up on a very fresh salad bar (though I wish the hard boiled egg was sliced or chopped instead of being whole boiled eggs ... a little odd). Or head straight to the pizza. Lots of topping choices, but all pizzas are on original-style crust (no thin crust options). That's ok, too, you just need to know that and maybe go somewhere else if you are a thin crust lover. You can also get marinara and cheese sticks, but make sure you save room for the cinnamon rolls.

I'd read lots of reviews about the cinnamon rolls and every one of them praised them. Trust the reviews. The rolls are something special.

Other plus factors: You can buy beer (Shiner and Deep Ellum are among the choices!), or get water or soda. Plenty of high chairs to grab and seat the littles.

The space is small so you'll do some crawling between tables and wait in pinch points to get to the salad or the pizza lines. But you know what? Everyone is so darn nice that it's just not a big deal at all. 

We'll definitely be back.

Review: My daughter and I are originally from Arlington. Mama's Pizza in Arlington was our go to pizza. It's been around for years! We moved to Frisco and we miss our pizza place.

Now if we could just get a Dino's in Frisco!! That would be Heaven!!

Review: Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly busy. The buffet line is small and can get congested quickly. They were a bit slow to put out hot pizzas. I feel like the options were more limited that previous visits. The pizza tasted fine and the salad bar was okay. The tables could have been cleaner. The cinnamon rolls only taste good hot! I will say that they can accommodate larger groups!

Review: Mamas Pizza is AMAZING!! I've been going there since I was a child and I highly recommend!! The dinner buffet is awesome but it's still worth the visit at lunch!! The pizzas are amazing and there's a great amount of pizza sizes and topping options. They also have a salad bar which is pretty darn cool. The pizza crust is really good too. Im picky about crust so I don't always eat pizza crust but Mamas Pizza pizza crust has the perfect amount of butter to make your mouth water for more. Always great pizza any time I go, never disappointed

Review: I know...shows like 10 years between visits...well it's not been 10 years, and sometimes...I don't always check in.  My bad!  haha.

Mama's Pizza is a Plano staple!  Unfortunately, COVID-19 has stopped their buffet...but not their pizza!  Ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 black olives and all mushroom tonight.  It is very good, and will continue into tomorrow for lunch.  haha.

Why not 5 stars?  well...the pizza is good and the staff is great.  but is the pizza 5 star great?  maybe 4.3?  Anyways, it's good, try them out.  Prices are very reasonable and as I mentioned, the staff is great!

Parking can get tight when busy, other businesses in the area too.

Review: It was difficult to leave San Diego and move to Dallas. However, I'm happy to be living in a place that offers some buffet options (even though Dallas doesn't seem to have as many as I expected).

During our first night in Dallas, "constant companion" found Mama's Pizza while he was looking for a buffet. He sold me on it when he said that it was around $7/person. I'm still in reverse sticker shock from California prices, so this seemed insane to me.

We came here on a Sunday night, which turned out to be the perfect time. It wasn't too busy but it was busy enough for them to have a constant supply of fresh pizzas. I heard them call out a lot of different topping variations while we were sitting in our booth. Some people complained on other reviews that they have a small selection, but I think it's a good idea to only have four pizzas out at a time. They stay fresh. The worst thing about pizza buffet is old pizza, and they avoid that at Mama's.

Besides being fresh, the pizza is pretty good (for buffet). I don't think I'd order any of the pizzas on their own, but I did really enjoy the pretzel like crust. It was tasty!

They also have a salad bar, pasta with marinara, cheesy bread, and cinnamon rolls. I was very happy with the selection. 

The place was clean and the food was good. Those are two things that I can't say about Cici's, which everyone seems to compare to Mama's. When you compare them, it's really no contest though. I compel you to choose Mama's. You'll thank me afterwards.

Review: We are from OKC and our pizza is pretty legit... This location was near the hotel we were staying and near the Walmart market store we shopped at .. so we gave it a try.
Cool throwback decor!!!
Greeted from a smiling staff member that explained all our questions. Including information on Togo slices!!! Wow this place is doing things right!!!

(Took Togo back to hotel staff... They were very pleased)

Mama's did a great job for dinner..
Got out cups and filled drinks  Drinks were kept on full. Pizzas came out /hot/fresh and tasty!!!

My beer was ice cold.

I recommend the cheese sticks and cinnamon rolls for must haves. The salad bar was fresh and tasty.. has me wanting to return when in the area!! 

Decently fast prepping of the food and the rest of the staff was super friendly! I was very pleased with our visit!

We will return when in the area!

Thanks for taking care of dinner on this Sunday evening as we got in the area for a 3 night stay!

Review: I was highly disappointed in Mama's Pizza strictly due to the pizza options. They only offered four pizzas at a time, but you can put in a request. The salad bar was bigger than the pizza warmer! $10 for all-you-can-eat. It is slight more expensive than Cici's and slightly better as well. The floors were really dirty and sticky so be careful walking back and forth. Oh, don't forget to try the cinnamon rolls. They weren't bad.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: We love Mama's  pizza.  It's the best pizza around to us.  We like it best take out only.    They seem to make much better pizzas to go than for the buffet. 
It is a buffet so the service is mainly at the counter but they are always friendly and efficient. 
The restaurant itself seems a little on the dark side for my taste but some would probably find it cozy.

Review: So, we used to head to the Mama's location, when we lived in Mansfield, it was always a great experience, so when we stumbled across a location here in Plano, we absolutely took a drive. The main difference is the Plano location offers their buffet at dinner as well as lunch,

Okay, the summary version is this:
1. The dining room is bigger than it looks from outside.
2. The parking lot and the entryway are small (and a bit of a pit of bottlenecks)
3. The service area for the buffet is too tight and congested.
4. Their pizza is fresh, delicious, and real. You won't find a buffet of child-focused option with nothing for an adult palette. (I refrain from naming names).
5. The salad bar is fresh with plenty of options.
6. Their creamy Italian dressing!!!!! 'Nuff said.
7. Fist-sized cinnamon rolls go really fast when they come up so be prepared.

The only item we did not like was their pasta sauce on the buffet. It was too thick and garlicky for our tastes. I do suspect it had been up there long enough to reduce and over- concentrate.

They offer their buffet at lunch and dinner, so give it a try. They also do a pretty darn good take out business. Give the little guy a shot here!

Review: Imo, the best pizza buffet for the money, period! Great, fresh salad bar with real salad dressing, not the waterdown version you sometimes get at other places. Really like their creamy italian. Most of the pizza selection is great. They will make what you want if you ask for it. There is a new Pizza Inn with all day buffet near where i live and it was no comparison to Mama's, and it cost few dollars more.
Gina the hostess is always super friendly and always remembers you. She will help in anyway if you need something. Entire staff is great!

Review: Pizza is always undercooked. I call to try and help them and the manager just gets short and hangs up.  Sad too.  This is a high end area w $2mil houses and lots of potential customers but they don't care.  Started out pretty good but now it just kinda sucks.  Fratelli and Campisi is a lot better.  2 stars bc the ingredients are good just poorly prepared and undercooked by 5-10min.  Sad for a $40 pizza.

Review: Went for the pizza buffet with the kids. Salad bar was a little lacking but it had the basics. The pizza selection varies as they are constantly bringing out different pies and pastas. They were all good but not "fantastic". Since it was a buffet there wasn't service per se, but the staff kept the food stocked and the cashier was very nice. 
As far as pizza buffets go, the ambiance was on par with what you'd expect. Parking was a bit difficult at lunchtime but adequate. Overall I'd say it was good but not great.

Review: Went to plano original location for dinner buffet. Only a few pizzas are served at a time but they kept on coming. Crust is surprisingly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Cinnamon buns are just rightly sweetened. This location which have been here for so long seems to have stood the test of time. Can't beat the price and the good Pizzas.
Also tried the Fort Worth location, but plano location quality is still better.

Review: The perfect hub of delicious pizza and pure nostalgia. As a fan of buffets, Mama's is one of the few places left post-Covid that gives you the pure enjoyment of returning to your table with plates piled to your hearts content. The wait for a fresh slice is never long, and even on the busiest evenings, the staff is cheerful and swift with their works. I've been to this place a ton since I was a kid, and the old timey mood is the piece de resistance for this restaurant. The arcade cabinet and candy machines add to the ambience of the joint, making it the perfect place for families of all sizes and ages. Even when you're full to the brim of salad, pizza, and cheesy bread-no evening is completed without a warm, buttery cinnamon roll. Their buffet deal is perfectly priced-and the food hits the spot whenever I happen to drop by. Mama's pizza, you'll always be my favorite pizza place!

Mama's Pizza is a Plano staple!  Unfortunately, COVID-19 has stopped their buffet...but not their pizza!  Ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 black olives and all mushroom tonight.  It is very good, and will continue into tomorrow for lunch.  haha.

Why not 5 stars?  well...the pizza is good and the staff is great.  but is the pizza 5 star great?  maybe 4.3?  Anyways, it's good, try them out.  Prices are very reasonable and as I mentioned, the staff is great!

Parking can get tight when busy, other businesses in the area too.

Review: They have the most incredible Buffet. And if they don't have what you want on buffet. Just ask them what you special order will be out in 7 to 10 minutes. Just enough time to eat their incredible salad bar.

Review: It was difficult to leave San Diego and move to Dallas. However, I'm happy to be living in a place that offers some buffet options (even though Dallas doesn't seem to have as many as I expected).

During our first night in Dallas, "constant companion" found Mama's Pizza while he was looking for a buffet. He sold me on it when he said that it was around $7/person. I'm still in reverse sticker shock from California prices, so this seemed insane to me.

We came here on a Sunday night, which turned out to be the perfect time. It wasn't too busy but it was busy enough for them to have a constant supply of fresh pizzas. I heard them call out a lot of different topping variations while we were sitting in our booth. Some people complained on other reviews that they have a small selection, but I think it's a good idea to only have four pizzas out at a time. They stay fresh. The worst thing about pizza buffet is old pizza, and they avoid that at Mama's.

Besides being fresh, the pizza is pretty good (for buffet). I don't think I'd order any of the pizzas on their own, but I did really enjoy the pretzel like crust. It was tasty!

They also have a salad bar, pasta with marinara, cheesy bread, and cinnamon rolls. I was very happy with the selection. 

The place was clean and the food was good. Those are two things that I can't say about Cici's, which everyone seems to compare to Mama's. When you compare them, it's really no contest though. I compel you to choose Mama's. You'll thank me afterwards.

Review: We are from OKC and our pizza is pretty legit... This location was near the hotel we were staying and near the Walmart market store we shopped at .. so we gave it a try.
Cool throwback decor!!!
Greeted from a smiling staff member that explained all our questions. Including information on Togo slices!!! Wow this place is doing things right!!!

(Took Togo back to hotel staff... They were very pleased)

Mama's did a great job for dinner..
Got out cups and filled drinks  Drinks were kept on full. Pizzas came out /hot/fresh and tasty!!!

My beer was ice cold.

I recommend the cheese sticks and cinnamon rolls for must haves. The salad bar was fresh and tasty.. has me wanting to return when in the area!! 

Decently fast prepping of the food and the rest of the staff was super friendly! I was very pleased with our visit!

We will return when in the area!

Thanks for taking care of dinner on this Sunday evening as we got in the area for a 3 night stay!

Respectfully,

Review: I was highly disappointed in Mama's Pizza strictly due to the pizza options. They only offered four pizzas at a time, but you can put in a request. The salad bar was bigger than the pizza warmer! $10 for all-you-can-eat. It is slight more expensive than Cici's and slightly better as well. The floors were really dirty and sticky so be careful walking back and forth. Oh, don't forget to try the cinnamon rolls. They weren't bad.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: We love Mama's  pizza.  It's the best pizza around to us.  We like it best take out only.    They seem to make much better pizzas to go than for the buffet. 
It is a buffet so the service is mainly at the counter but they are always friendly and efficient. 
The restaurant itself seems a little on the dark side for my taste but some would probably find it cozy.

Review: So, we used to head to the Mama's location, when we lived in Mansfield, it was always a great experience, so when we stumbled across a location here in Plano, we absolutely took a drive. The main difference is the Plano location offers their buffet at dinner as well as lunch,

Okay, the summary version is this:
1. The dining room is bigger than it looks from outside.
2. The parking lot and the entryway are small (and a bit of a pit of bottlenecks)
3. The service area for the buffet is too tight and congested.
4. Their pizza is fresh, delicious, and real. You won't find a buffet of child-focused option with nothing for an adult palette. (I refrain from naming names).
5. The salad bar is fresh with plenty of options.
6. Their creamy Italian dressing!!!!! 'Nuff said.
7. Fist-sized cinnamon rolls go really fast when they come up so be prepared.

The only item we did not like was their pasta sauce on the buffet. It was too thick and garlicky for our tastes. I do suspect it had been up there long enough to reduce and over- concentrate.

They offer their buffet at lunch and dinner, so give it a try. They also do a pretty darn good take out business. Give the little guy a shot here!

Review: Imo, the best pizza buffet for the money, period! Great, fresh salad bar with real salad dressing, not the waterdown version you sometimes get at other places. Really like their creamy italian. Most of the pizza selection is great. They will make what you want if you ask for it. There is a new Pizza Inn with all day buffet near where i live and it was no comparison to Mama's, and it cost few dollars more.
Gina the hostess is always super friendly and always remembers you. She will help in anyway if you need something. Entire staff is great!

Review: Pizza is always undercooked. I call to try and help them and the manager just gets short and hangs up.  Sad too.  This is a high end area w $2mil houses and lots of potential customers but they don't care.  Started out pretty good but now it just kinda sucks.  Fratelli and Campisi is a lot better.  2 stars bc the ingredients are good just poorly prepared and undercooked by 5-10min.  Sad for a $40 pizza.

Review: One price for the buffet on their website and a higher price when you get there.  Rude and condescending woman at register.  They wouldn't honor the advertised price from their website, so as opposed to getting aggravated with their poor customer service and attitude I left.

Review: Went for the pizza buffet with the kids. Salad bar was a little lacking but it had the basics. The pizza selection varies as they are constantly bringing out different pies and pastas. They were all good but not "fantastic". Since it was a buffet there wasn't service per se, but the staff kept the food stocked and the cashier was very nice. 
As far as pizza buffets go, the ambiance was on par with what you'd expect. Parking was a bit difficult at lunchtime but adequate. Overall I'd say it was good but not great.

Review: Went to plano original location for dinner buffet. Only a few pizzas are served at a time but they kept on coming. Crust is surprisingly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Cinnamon buns are just rightly sweetened. This location which have been here for so long seems to have stood the test of time. Can't beat the price and the good Pizzas.
Also tried the Fort Worth location, but plano location quality is still better.

Review: The perfect hub of delicious pizza and pure nostalgia. As a fan of buffets, Mama's is one of the few places left post-Covid that gives you the pure enjoyment of returning to your table with plates piled to your hearts content. The wait for a fresh slice is never long, and even on the busiest evenings, the staff is cheerful and swift with their works. I've been to this place a ton since I was a kid, and the old timey mood is the piece de resistance for this restaurant. The arcade cabinet and candy machines add to the ambience of the joint, making it the perfect place for families of all sizes and ages. Even when you're full to the brim of salad, pizza, and cheesy bread-no evening is completed without a warm, buttery cinnamon roll. Their buffet deal is perfectly priced-and the food hits the spot whenever I happen to drop by. Mama's pizza, you'll always be my favorite pizza place!

Review: I have lived in Texas for 45 years. When we were younger we got all of our pizzas from Mamas in Carrollton,  it was exciting, like a huge treat.I never have been to this one all this time, so I was so excited and then so disappointed. The salad bar made Cici's look amazing. I was excited they had whole boiled eggs...that probably had been boiled for 30 minites..They would probably be great as bouncing balls. I then got 2 breadsticks and 2 slices of pizza. I used over 6 napkins to sop up the grease, still had maybe 4 bites, also everything was so salty..Then I thought I would give 1 last effort to "the amazing cinnamon rolls" it tasted like a Grands cinnamon roll on steroids. So yes I hate giving negative reviews. Oh and the sweet lady who busts her butt clearing the dishes. People leave her a small tip, for your 10 plates on the table.

Review: I've been ordering pizza from Mamma's since 1980 and currently drive 45 min round trip to pick my pizzas up.  No more.  Some may blame Covid, supply chain, inflation, labor shortages for the skimpy use of ingredients that made a Mamma's pizza stand out from all others but the problems are deeper.   Slicing a 20" pizza in 2.5" slices is ridiculous.   Was ice cold pizza by the time we got home.   I gave Mamma's too much time I guess, picked it up early even.   They told me the pizza had anchovies on the whole pizza...was only intended for half...there were none on the pizza.

That's it.   No reason ever to go to Mamma's.   I hope they change back to what made them great.   It was gross.   They will go out of business if management doesn't step in at some point soon.

Review: Brought a friend for the buffet since I haven't been here since I retired (just in time before covid!). The pizza was just as good as I remembered. Very good.  And the salad was good - very fresh & crisp lettuce, lots to add and the wonderful ranch dressing. I splurged & had the cinnamon roll too. We went about 11:15 before it got too crowded. It was an enjoyable trip & I'm so glad we went. They sure work hard to keep the pizzas coming, the salad bar refilled and keeping the cinnamon rolls available. Customers were good about waiting in line - good thing as I would have hit someone with a plate if they tried to reach across me. I went back a few times but, well, it was just good.

In an establishment that clearly feels Like it's still not segrated an we living in the 50's. where yt's and blacks are not supposed to eat togethet in harmony. YT FAMILY FRIENDLY definitely not the latter.  WE WILL NEVER BRING OUR FAMILY HERE AGAIN.

Review: I've been coming to Mama's Pizza since I moved to Plano from San Diego  in 2005. I usually go to Buffett and they have a salad bar(I really like the salad bar, they have a good one), different kind of pizza, cheese bread, tomato sauce, pasta and cinnamon rolls. They now have a lunch Buffett, I think from 11am to 2pm. I went there about 1pm and it wasn't too packed. They didn't have a veggie pizza out there, so I had cheese bread with tomato sauce and ranch dressing from the salad bar and they were delicious!!! It's just a great, friendly place to eat in my neighborhood and I like to support the local business.

Review: It's been a minute since I've eaten at Mama's pizza and decided to stop in and eat with my husband for lunch. As usual the staff was friendly, the price reasonable, and the food delicious! I grew up in Plano and this was the spot during lunch time and on weekends. I've been on a Keto diet for almost 6 months now with absolutely NO bread during this time but decided to enjoy myself and have a few slices. It was absolutely worth it and was everything I knew it would be. I LOVE the salad bar here and they are one of the few places that offer creamy Italian dressing!

Review: If you like pizza buffets and want a break from CiCi's, check out Mama's! 

It has that 80's/ 90's feel to it. It seems like that place you went as a kid or in high school and those memories come back when you go as an adult. (I had a pizza place like this in New Orleans but I'm here now and I get that same vibe)

You're able to make requests for pizza that you want! The slices are cut small so that you're able to sample other pizzas without wasting food. 

There's a salad bar, pasta bar, pizza and dessert (cinnamon rolls). Unlimited soda refills and an old school arcade game for the kids. 

TIP: Bring a handful of quarters if you have kids. They have those gum ball/ prize machines where you inert quarters. I promise your kids rarely see this and it's cool to see their reaction when they use it! 

The door is great and the prices are even greater. It's a great night out alone, on a date (not a first date!!!) or with family/ friends. You can feed everyone and not break the bank. 

Check it out!

Review: We've only talked about coming here for the 15+ years we've lived in Plano. This is definitely a hometown favorite. Why? All-you-can-eat buffet that's reasonably priced and tasty food. At $6.95 per adult, you really can't go wrong and the constant flow of families testifies they've found the right price point for what's on offer.

You can fill up on a very fresh salad bar (though I wish the hard boiled egg was sliced or chopped instead of being whole boiled eggs ... a little odd). Or head straight to the pizza. Lots of topping choices, but all pizzas are on original-style crust (no thin crust options). That's ok, too, you just need to know that and maybe go somewhere else if you are a thin crust lover. You can also get marinara and cheese sticks, but make sure you save room for the cinnamon rolls.

I'd read lots of reviews about the cinnamon rolls and every one of them praised them. Trust the reviews. The rolls are something special.

Other plus factors: You can buy beer (Shiner and Deep Ellum are among the choices!), or get water or soda. Plenty of high chairs to grab and seat the littles.

The space is small so you'll do some crawling between tables and wait in pinch points to get to the salad or the pizza lines. But you know what? Everyone is so darn nice that it's just not a big deal at all. 

We'll definitely be back.

Review: My daughter and I are originally from Arlington. Mama's Pizza in Arlington was our go to pizza. It's been around for years! We moved to Frisco and we miss our pizza place. Then my daughter found out there is one in Plano so we went the next night. Omg it was absolutely delicious. So happy to have a pizza place we love so close. Now if we could just get a Dino's in Frisco!! That would be Heaven!!

Review: Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly busy. The buffet line is small and can get congested quickly. They were a bit slow to put out hot pizzas.

I will say that they can accommodate larger groups!

The pizzas are amazing and there's a great amount of pizza sizes and topping options. They also have a salad bar which is pretty darn cool. The pizza crust is really good too. Im picky about crust so I don't always eat pizza crust but Mamas Pizza pizza crust has the perfect amount of butter to make your mouth water for more. Always great pizza any time I go, never disappointed
