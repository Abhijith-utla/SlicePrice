Review: I honestly would rather have consistently decent food and pizza hut provides that experience for me. I can always depend on a decent meal in 2024 and thats all I ask for! Thank you. 

You are better than all of these inconsistent places. Its been getting ridiculous in the fast food world.

Review: I give this 5 stars due to the fact that they are quick with orders and delivering on a timely manner. Even when they made a mistake they fix the issue with solutions and not leave you disappointed. I personally have had a great experience at this Pizza Hut

Review: It's Pizza Hut. I order last minute for delivery or pickup and the pizza is ready in 20-30 min. Can't tell you what the ambiance is because I never go in. Either it shows up at my door or I pull up and they put it in my car. Pizza always tastes like Pizza Hut and the original crust is always buttery. Why 5 star? Because I don't go order Pizza Hut delivery expecting it to be some gourmet pizza. It shows up for parties and football games to go with copious amounts of beer.

Review: What a pleasant surprise... Pizza Hut is back in the game. I have not ordered in a while but decided to give another try after over a year and boy I am glad I did. That was the most delicious pizza I have had in a very long time. It was so hot it burned the roof of my mouth a bit... lol
Thank you for stepping up your game and making an excellent pizza and it was also delivered on time. Great Job everyone!!!

Review: Only giving 2 stars for prompt delivery & taste. Ordered a make your own supreme/meat pizza and it was delicious.

Unfortunately, there was a rock-like substance that was easily mistaken for a piece of black olive, which almost broke my tooth.

Not the best for a $33 pizza.

Review: Deserves no star rating. ordered online with curbside pickup. Waited at curb for 20 minutes after order due time. Not a clue about customer service here. Ordered wings & pizza. Wings were tough and stale. Like made a week ago and stuck on the back counter for some sucker to order. Pizza was absolutely FOUL. stale with disgusting cardboard tasting thin crust. Half of pizza had pepperoni - they put all of 4 slices on it. 
I have been buying pizza for decades in NY, Chicago & everywhere in between, I will never ever buy anything from Pizza Butt again. Take my advice - buy store bought and make it yourself. Pizza Butt needs to be driven out of business.

Review: Cardboard with tomato sauce and garlic would of tasted better. I remember when pizza hut was good. Sorry cannot do this anymore. A frozen pizza from Wal Mart is much better. Dont waste your money. Ever since the chinese have bought KFC,Taco Bell and Pizza Hut the food is not worth eating.

Review: Online says they're open but when I pulled up there's a handwritten sign that says "sorry we're closed." 

When I looked to the right (door where they take that trash out, exit for delivery, etc) there's a few employees sitting there smoking  cigs.  

My initial frustrated thoughts were why are they closed but when I saw the employees (looking careless and washed up) casually puffing on their cigs I thought... this must be a sign from God. 

I think that'll be my last visit to there.  I'm an 80's baby and I remember when Pizza Hut used to dominate the industry... times have surely changed that.

Review: I'm giving a very deep sigh right now. I wanted pizza and I thought about Pizza Hut. Well I usually don't even bother with this location. I either go to the food stand in Target, or drive 10 minutes to the one on Dallas Parkway in Frisco. Well it's been a long day and I didn't feel like driving, and the stand at Target was probably closing soon. Soooo, I had an ounce of hope that the Ohio Drive location got better. W-R-O-N-G..... I'm also babysitting and even the kids were turned off. I don't know if they were running out of cheese, but they could've thrown another fistful on there. The piled plenty of Hut Flavor seasoning on the crust. It's greasy and goopy. The sauce tastes watered down.. I should've just went to Target. They have 9 inch personal pans now! I'm officially done with this location.

Review: The pizza was ready in 15 minutes, so that should've been enough of a warning.  The first bite immediately felt stale, and the crust was doughy and the cheese was congealed.  All in all it tasted like moldy bread.

Review: ZERO STARS!!! Tonight I ordered online for my pizza and two Hersheys's chocolate chip cookie for delivery at 9pm. I put directions down how to get into my neighborhood and left my house phone number. Waited for the delivery pizza guy to come. Noticing the pizza hut delivery was talking a bit to long. I called the pizza hut place at 10:30pm to see my order is on its way. The person on the phone said it will be there soon. I waited a half an hour at 11:30pm.  

At this point I'm getting fed up waiting for my order that I ordered. I called the Pizza Hut place again. I give them my online order number and my address. The guy on the phone tells me the pizza hut delivery guy called my house phone and got no response and they told me I put down the wrong phone number I gave them. No I didn't put the wrong house number down because I always check for that stuff when I'm ordering online for food. Plus if you call only one time and get no response. Shouldn't you call that phone number again just to make sure? Then just assuming you called the wrong phone number?

Plus the guy on the phone told me they don't deliver into my area because it's to far away from the driver and they might of changed the delivery route!  
ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!  You pizza hut guys are located only 10 minutes from my neighborhood and you tell me you can't deliver the food that I ordered?! Because its to far away from pizza delivery guy liking?!

The guy on the phone asked have they delivered to my address before?
I told the guy on the phone yes you have many times!

Then guy on the phone then said since they got no response from the phone number I gave them and the area to my neighborhood was to far away... The delivery guy had to return the order that I was waiting for back to the pizza hut place and had to let the delivery guy go for night. They guy said sorry and then hanged up the phone.

IDIOTS!! THANK YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME AND PATIENTCE FOR YOUR PATHETIC EXCUSES!! IT'S A BUNCH OF BULLS#&T!

Review: Our work group came today. We ordered pizza, wings, and bread sticks. Everything was perfectly cooked and the service was spot on. The supreme pizza has a few less toppings than I expected, and the veggie just did not have a great flavor, and I always like veggie. They also serve pepsi instead of Coke, bummer. It is dark and outdated inside, needs a big update.

Review: Tonight I went to eat at this Pizza Hut location. Upon walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant. I asked for a menu review. Afterward, I stood at the counter to provide my order as a man was being helped in front of me. Shortly, another gentleman walk into the store and stood in line. After the man in front of me walks away, the employee skips me and proceeds to assist the gentleman who walked in after I was already in line.  While that was already annoying, I never interrupted and waited.  After that gentleman walks away, the employee fumbles with a few pens and a receipt and never makes eye contact with me, even though I was less than 3 feet away from him. After waiting for around 30-45 seconds for the employee to make eye contact, he asked "what is your name" and what he could do for me. I told him that he skipped me to help a man who was behind me in line and the response was, "uh, ok."  Then I proceeded to be annoyed and expressed that he ignored me even after the last gentleman was helped walked away. Again, he responded with "uh, ok." That is when I got upset and responded with "no, that's not ok," followed by a firm stare.

In addition, this employee failed to ask me if it is dine in or take out.  As a result, I was given the pizza in a box, even though I was dining in. The pizza was brought out by another employee in a dine on a dine in plate, the main employee at issue brought our my wings in a bag and to go box.  Why would he do that AFTER seeing that my pizza was being brought out on a dine in plate and I was sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  This employee has zero self awareness and ability to process information.  

Based on the above stated facts, it is hard to argue that this location has very poor customer service. The employee in question is Keya. He is either mentally challenged, undertrained or simply has zero work ethic. If he doesn't want to work, then don't get a job, proceed to play video games at home and rely on mom and dad.  Either way, this Pizza Hut location a substandard choice for a pizza outing because of him and I would not recommend this location to anyone.

Review: Worst experience. Very rude and unprofessional staff. Make mistakes in orders and give attitude of call to complaint. They make pizza with large side crust to save on cheese and pizza sauce and of course toppings. Don't go there.

Review: I wish I could give no star. Had multiple bad experience with this location and now finally pushed me to write review. So, to start with if you go online it says store is closed and takes me to pre order. I had to call store to put order the guy I talked to said online is closed because we don't have internet, fair enough reason? I placed my order and total comes out subtotal 6.50 so they denied delivery, this review is for Pizza Hut itself now. Minimum delivery? So I asked what is minimum and he said $10. I checked online if he was right and site said $7.99. So liers and unprofessional full of employees at this location. Definitely not ordering ever. Manager Andy seem to have no concern whatsoever.

Review: This used to be our favorite carry out place but for the last couple of months the service has turned horrible.They never put the toppings correctly,pizza is thin for a pan crust & the breadsticks were so hard that we had to throw them away.Waste of money & waste of time.Will never order at this location again.

Review: Pizza was great but there's a blonde employee who's always on her phone and isn't professional . Heaven help you if you need a drink if you dine in. .. or phone in an order.  We dined in and it appears only 25% of phone calls were answered. Plus we never got a refill

Review: Had dinner here with my family. Our server was very good, and she always had a friendly smile. Our 2 medium pizzas (both half-n-half, one with no sauce) came out quickly and were cooked right.  Great pizza. The server had our cinnamon sticks out just at the right time. The only negatives were some crumbs on a couple tables, and the small restrooms are pretty dated .. could use a restroom make-over.

Review: Absolute worst pizza I have ever had.  I should have saved my money and made a frozen totinos pizza.  Pizza was cold upon delivery and all shook up inside the box.  Pan crust was thinner than the thin crust . . . Ended up throwing it away.  Will never order from here again. Only picked 1 star because it made me . . . .

Review: Nothing irritates me more than wasting my time. I ordered online to pickup two pizzas, cheese sticks and a 2 liter. I go to pick it up at the designated time (45 minutes after I placed the order) and their credit card system is down and they tell me to go next door to get cash. 45 minutes had lapsed since I had placed my online order which required me to include both my phone number and email address. You couldn't contact me and tell me that before I got there? I had hungry kids in the car and a sick hubby at home and had to go find an atm machine while my order sat there getting cold. Very disappointed and not the way to treat your customers! I relayed my frustration to the employee who had no interest in rectifying the situation. I understand things happen, but how difficult is it to communicate issues to your customers? Time to find a new Pizza Hut.

Review: Ordered a supreme pizza on thin and crispy crust with an order of the cinnamon sticks. The pizza was cold and soggy. Terrible. The cinnamon sticks were good. Never will order from them again. I am down the street and took 50 minutes to get the stuff. Driver said they were slow, so they were not busy.

Review: Zero stars! Just ordered from this location and they delivered sloppy COLD pizza with barely any cheese. This location is sloppy and has very bad customer service. Will be contacting corporate. You can't run a store to serve clean warm food then stay out of business instead of wasting people's time and money! Don't ever order from this store. Oh and they never answer the phone.

Review: Had the worst experience ever with this store. The canceled my order arbitrarily 5m after I placed it because it was 30m before store close. They never informed me, and when I called to find out why the order was late, they said they did not have it in their system and there was nothing they could do. I told them I had even been charged for it and the attendant told me to stop by tomorrow to get reimbursed. I called my credit card and found out THEY had done a reverse charge on my card, which proves they did cancel the order on purpose. I am pregnant, we literally just moved and had no food in the house. Never recommend this store to anyone.

Review: Can I give them a -5 stars?  This is the 3rd, count them, not the 1st, not the 2nd, THE THIRD time I have ordered a delivery from this store.  EACH TIME, they have been a minimum of 20 minutes late, past the time I requested the order to be delivered.  I'm not ordering during their rush hour - I have placed the order hours, if not days, prior to when I need it.  This last time, I called the store at 10:25am (before they "opened for business").  No one answered the phone until 10:35am.  I was very specific in stating that I needed it here by 11:30am AT THE LATEST.  At 11:40am, I was calling the store.  Got sent to some operator who then switched me over to the store.  Some girl/lady started arguing with me on the phone about the order!  Then she put me on "hold" which was basically disconnecting the call (i.e. HUNG UP ON ME).  I called back - went somewhere with a recording of "we are having technical difficulties"!  WTH?  I called back again, and again.  Told the lady that the order was for 11:30 and now it was 11:50.  Her response?  Click.  What time did the delivery guy walk in?  12:05PM!!!  This wasn't a big order - 3 pizzas and breadsticks.  Didn't even bother them for drinks!  He was so casual, I swear he could have been high.  When I told him he was late, he was like "well, I'm new."  (Sorry dude, you were "new" last month.)  When I asked for the managers' name, he responded with "why?" - "Why? Because you're over a 1/2 hour late!  That's why! Tell your manager that I'm calling your corporate offices because OBVIOUSLY she can't run a store!"  When I asked if I had to sign something (the receipt) he's like "yeah."  "Do you have a pen?"  "Nah, someone stole it from me. Do you have one?"  

FYI - My uncle owns a whole group of Pizza Huts (not in this area) - if this would have been one of his stores, well - first of all, he wouldn't hire idiots like these, secondly, if by accident a few slipped in - they would have been fired for this behavior.  You're losing business and money, Pizza Hut on Ohio Dr.  I feel like Taylor Swift because we ARE NEVER, EVER, EVER ordering from you again!

Review: After waiting 10 minutes to place an order (being the only two people in the place) we were finally asked if we needed to order. In that ten minute span at least 9 employees walked by seeing someone at the front desk two of them actually said something to us along the lines of "oh there are people here" and "I don't know where anything is they lost the key". 3 employees were screaming at each other just on the other side of the swinging door, another arguing with his mom on the phone at the front counter but wouldn't help us because he "works in the back" and clearly was preoccupied. I'm not sure what kind of work was going on there all I know is if my pizza wasn't free I wouldn't have given them my business and will not going forward. So if your looking for a minimum wage paying job where you get paid to just do your own thing and maybe participate in running a pizza through the oven every so often; I highly recommend this place. But from a customer service point of view, how this place is still open is beyond me. They have some serious employee revisions to make.

In addition, this employee failed to ask me if it is dine in or take out.  As a result, I was given the pizza in a box, even though I was dining in. The pizza was brought out by another employee in a dine on a dine in plate, the main employee at issue brought our my wings in a bag and to go box.  Why would he do that AFTER seeing that my pizza was being brought out on a dine in plate and I was sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  This employee has zero self awareness and ability to process information.  

Based on the above stated facts, it is hard to argue that this location has very poor customer service. The employee in question is Keya. He is either mentally challenged, undertrained or simply has zero work ethic. If he doesn't want to work, then don't get a job, proceed to play video games at home and rely on mom and dad.  Either way, this Pizza Hut location a substandard choice for a pizza outing because of him and I would not recommend this location to anyone.

Review: Worst experience. Very rude and unprofessional staff. Make mistakes in orders and give attitude of call to complaint. They make pizza with large side crust to save on cheese and pizza sauce and of course toppings. Don't go there.

Review: I wish I could give no star. Had multiple bad experience with this location and now finally pushed me to write review. So, to start with if you go online it says store is closed and takes me to pre order. I had to call store to put order the guy I talked to said online is closed because we don't have internet, fair enough reason? I placed my order and total comes out subtotal 6.50 so they denied delivery, this review is for Pizza Hut itself now. Minimum delivery? So I asked what is minimum and he said $10. I checked online if he was right and site said $7.99. So liers and unprofessional full of employees at this location. Definitely not ordering ever. Manager Andy seem to have no concern whatsoever.

Review: This used to be our favorite carry out place but for the last couple of months the service has turned horrible.They never put the toppings correctly,pizza is thin for a pan crust & the breadsticks were so hard that we had to throw them away.Waste of money & waste of time.Will never order at this location again.

Review: Pizza was great but there's a blonde employee who's always on her phone and isn't professional . Heaven help you if you need a drink if you dine in. .. or phone in an order.  We dined in and it appears only 25% of phone calls were answered. Plus we never got a refill

Review: Had dinner here with my family. Our server was very good, and she always had a friendly smile. Our 2 medium pizzas (both half-n-half, one with no sauce) came out quickly and were cooked right.  Great pizza. The server had our cinnamon sticks out just at the right time. The only negatives were some crumbs on a couple tables, and the small restrooms are pretty dated .. could use a restroom make-over.

Review: Absolute worst pizza I have ever had.  I should have saved my money and made a frozen totinos pizza.  Pizza was cold upon delivery and all shook up inside the box.  Pan crust was thinner than the thin crust . . . Ended up throwing it away.  Will never order from here again. Only picked 1 star because it made me . . . .

Review: Nothing irritates me more than wasting my time. I ordered online to pickup two pizzas, cheese sticks and a 2 liter. I go to pick it up at the designated time (45 minutes after I placed the order) and their credit card system is down and they tell me to go next door to get cash. 45 minutes had lapsed since I had placed my online order which required me to include both my phone number and email address. You couldn't contact me and tell me that before I got there? I had hungry kids in the car and a sick hubby at home and had to go find an atm machine while my order sat there getting cold. Very disappointed and not the way to treat your customers! I relayed my frustration to the employee who had no interest in rectifying the situation. I understand things happen, but how difficult is it to communicate issues to your customers? Time to find a new Pizza Hut.

Review: Ordered a supreme pizza on thin and crispy crust with an order of the cinnamon sticks. The pizza was cold and soggy. Terrible. The cinnamon sticks were good. Never will order from them again. I am down the street and took 50 minutes to get the stuff. Driver said they were slow, so they were not busy.

Review: Zero stars! Just ordered from this location and they delivered sloppy COLD pizza with barely any cheese. This location is sloppy and has very bad customer service. Will be contacting corporate. You can't run a store to serve clean warm food then stay out of business instead of wasting people's time and money! Don't ever order from this store. Oh and they never answer the phone.

Review: Had the worst experience ever with this store. The canceled my order arbitrarily 5m after I placed it because it was 30m before store close. They never informed me, and when I called to find out why the order was late, they said they did not have it in their system and there was nothing they could do. I told them I had even been charged for it and the attendant told me to stop by tomorrow to get reimbursed. I called my credit card and found out THEY had done a reverse charge on my card, which proves they did cancel the order on purpose. I am pregnant, we literally just moved and had no food in the house. Never recommend this store to anyone.

Review: Can I give them a -5 stars?  This is the 3rd, count them, not the 1st, not the 2nd, THE THIRD time I have ordered a delivery from this store.  EACH TIME, they have been a minimum of 20 minutes late, past the time I requested the order to be delivered.  I'm not ordering during their rush hour - I have placed the order hours, if not days, prior to when I need it.  This last time, I called the store at 10:25am (before they "opened for business").  No one answered the phone until 10:35am.  I was very specific in stating that I needed it here by 11:30am AT THE LATEST.  At 11:40am, I was calling the store.  Got sent to some operator who then switched me over to the store.  Some girl/lady started arguing with me on the phone about the order!  Then she put me on "hold" which was basically disconnecting the call (i.e. HUNG UP ON ME).  I called back - went somewhere with a recording of "we are having technical difficulties"!  WTH?  I called back again, and again.  Told the lady that the order was for 11:30 and now it was 11:50.  Her response?  Click.  What time did the delivery guy walk in?  12:05PM!!!  This wasn't a big order - 3 pizzas and breadsticks.  Didn't even bother them for drinks!  He was so casual, I swear he could have been high.  When I told him he was late, he was like "well, I'm new."  (Sorry dude, you were "new" last month.)  When I asked for the managers' name, he responded with "why?" - "Why? Because you're over a 1/2 hour late!  That's why! Tell your manager that I'm calling your corporate offices because OBVIOUSLY she can't run a store!"  When I asked if I had to sign something (the receipt) he's like "yeah."  "Do you have a pen?"  "Nah, someone stole it from me. Do you have one?"  

FYI - My uncle owns a whole group of Pizza Huts (not in this area) - if this would have been one of his stores, well - first of all, he wouldn't hire idiots like these, secondly, if by accident a few slipped in - they would have been fired for this behavior.  You're losing business and money, Pizza Hut on Ohio Dr.  I feel like Taylor Swift because we ARE NEVER, EVER, EVER ordering from you again!

Review: After waiting 10 minutes to place an order (being the only two people in the place) we were finally asked if we needed to order. In that ten minute span at least 9 employees walked by seeing someone at the front desk two of them actually said something to us along the lines of "oh there are people here" and "I don't know where anything is they lost the key". 3 employees were screaming at each other just on the other side of the swinging door, another arguing with his mom on the phone at the front counter but wouldn't help us because he "works in the back" and clearly was preoccupied. I'm not sure what kind of work was going on there all I know is if my pizza wasn't free I wouldn't have given them my business and will not going forward. So if your looking for a minimum wage paying job where you get paid to just do your own thing and maybe participate in running a pizza through the oven every so often; I highly recommend this place. But from a customer service point of view, how this place is still open is beyond me. They have some serious employee revisions to make.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I honestly would rather have consistently decent food and pizza hut provides that experience for me. I can always depend on a decent meal in 2024 and thats all I ask for! Thank you. 

You are better than all of these inconsistent places. Its been getting ridiculous in the fast food world.

Review: I give this 5 stars due to the fact that they are quick with orders and delivering on a timely manner. Even when they made a mistake they fix the issue with solutions and not leave you disappointed. I personally have had a great experience at this Pizza Hut

Review: It's Pizza Hut. I order last minute for delivery or pickup and the pizza is ready in 20-30 min. Can't tell you what the ambiance is because I never go in. Either it shows up at my door or I pull up and they put it in my car. Pizza always tastes like Pizza Hut and the original crust is always buttery. Why 5 star? Because I don't go order Pizza Hut delivery expecting it to be some gourmet pizza. It shows up for parties and football games to go with copious amounts of beer.

Review: What a pleasant surprise... Pizza Hut is back in the game. I have not ordered in a while but decided to give another try after over a year and boy I am glad I did. That was the most delicious pizza I have had in a very long time. It was so hot it burned the roof of my mouth a bit... lol
Thank you for stepping up your game and making an excellent pizza and it was also delivered on time. Great Job everyone!!!

Review: Only giving 2 stars for prompt delivery & taste. Ordered a make your own supreme/meat pizza and it was delicious.

Unfortunately, there was a rock-like substance that was easily mistaken for a piece of black olive, which almost broke my tooth.

Not the best for a $33 pizza.

Review: Deserves no star rating. ordered online with curbside pickup. Waited at curb for 20 minutes after order due time. Not a clue about customer service here. Ordered wings & pizza. Wings were tough and stale. Like made a week ago and stuck on the back counter for some sucker to order. Pizza was absolutely FOUL. stale with disgusting cardboard tasting thin crust. Half of pizza had pepperoni - they put all of 4 slices on it. 
I have been buying pizza for decades in NY, Chicago & everywhere in between, I will never ever buy anything from Pizza Butt again. Take my advice - buy store bought and make it yourself. Pizza Butt needs to be driven out of business.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: Cardboard with tomato sauce and garlic would of tasted better. I remember when pizza hut was good. Sorry cannot do this anymore. A frozen pizza from Wal Mart is much better. Dont waste your money. Ever since the chinese have bought KFC,Taco Bell and Pizza Hut the food is not worth eating.

Review: Online says they're open but when I pulled up there's a handwritten sign that says "sorry we're closed." 

When I looked to the right (door where they take that trash out, exit for delivery, etc) there's a few employees sitting there smoking  cigs.  

My initial frustrated thoughts were why are they closed but when I saw the employees (looking careless and washed up) casually puffing on their cigs I thought... this must be a sign from God. 

I think that'll be my last visit to there.  I'm an 80's baby and I remember when Pizza Hut used to dominate the industry... times have surely changed that.

Review: I'm giving a very deep sigh right now. I wanted pizza and I thought about Pizza Hut. Well I usually don't even bother with this location. I either go to the food stand in Target, or drive 10 minutes to the one on Dallas Parkway in Frisco. Well it's been a long day and I didn't feel like driving, and the stand at Target was probably closing soon. Soooo, I had an ounce of hope that the Ohio Drive location got better. W-R-O-N-G..... I'm also babysitting and even the kids were turned off. I don't know if they were running out of cheese, but they could've thrown another fistful on there. The piled plenty of Hut Flavor seasoning on the crust. It's greasy and goopy. The sauce tastes watered down.. I should've just went to Target. They have 9 inch personal pans now! I'm officially done with this location.

Review: The pizza was ready in 15 minutes, so that should've been enough of a warning.  The first bite immediately felt stale, and the crust was doughy and the cheese was congealed.  All in all it tasted like moldy bread.

Review: ZERO STARS!!! Tonight I ordered online for my pizza and two Hersheys's chocolate chip cookie for delivery at 9pm. I put directions down how to get into my neighborhood and left my house phone number. Waited for the delivery pizza guy to come. Noticing the pizza hut delivery was talking a bit to long. I called the pizza hut place at 10:30pm to see my order is on its way. The person on the phone said it will be there soon. I waited a half an hour at 11:30pm.  

At this point I'm getting fed up waiting for my order that I ordered. I called the Pizza Hut place again. I give them my online order number and my address. The guy on the phone tells me the pizza hut delivery guy called my house phone and got no response and they told me I put down the wrong phone number I gave them. No I didn't put the wrong house number down because I always check for that stuff when I'm ordering online for food. Plus if you call only one time and get no response. Shouldn't you call that phone number again just to make sure? Then just assuming you called the wrong phone number?

Plus the guy on the phone told me they don't deliver into my area because it's to far away from the driver and they might of changed the delivery route!  
ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!  You pizza hut guys are located only 10 minutes from my neighborhood and you tell me you can't deliver the food that I ordered?! Because its to far away from pizza delivery guy liking?!

The guy on the phone asked have they delivered to my address before?
I told the guy on the phone yes you have many times!

Then guy on the phone then said since they got no response from the phone number I gave them and the area to my neighborhood was to far away... The delivery guy had to return the order that I was waiting for back to the pizza hut place and had to let the delivery guy go for night. They guy said sorry and then hanged up the phone.

IDIOTS!! THANK YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME AND PATIENTCE FOR YOUR PATHETIC EXCUSES!! IT'S A BUNCH OF BULLS#&T!

Review: Our work group came today. We ordered pizza, wings, and bread sticks. Everything was perfectly cooked and the service was spot on. The supreme pizza has a few less toppings than I expected, and the veggie just did not have a great flavor, and I always like veggie. They also serve pepsi instead of Coke, bummer. It is dark and outdated inside, needs a big update.

Review: Tonight I went to eat at this Pizza Hut location. Upon walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant. I asked for a menu review. Afterward, I stood at the counter to provide my order as a man was being helped in front of me. Shortly, another gentleman walk into the store and stood in line. After the man in front of me walks away, the employee skips me and proceeds to assist the gentleman who walked in after I was already in line.  While that was already annoying, I never interrupted and waited.  After that gentleman walks away, the employee fumbles with a few pens and a receipt and never makes eye contact with me, even though I was less than 3 feet away from him. After waiting for around 30-45 seconds for the employee to make eye contact, he asked "what is your name" and what he could do for me. I told him that he skipped me to help a man who was behind me in line and the response was, "uh, ok."  Then I proceeded to be annoyed and expressed that he ignored me even after the last gentleman was helped walked away. Again, he responded with "uh, ok." That is when I got upset and responded with "no, that's not ok," followed by a firm stare.

In addition, this employee failed to ask me if it is dine in or take out.  As a result, I was given the pizza in a box, even though I was dining in. The pizza was brought out by another employee in a dine on a dine in plate, the main employee at issue brought our my wings in a bag and to go box.  Why would he do that AFTER seeing that my pizza was being brought out on a dine in plate and I was sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.

In that ten minute span at least 9 employees walked by seeing someone at the front desk two of them actually said something to us along the lines of "oh there are people here" and "I don't know where anything is they lost the key". 3 employees were screaming at each other just on the other side of the swinging door, another arguing with his mom on the phone at the front counter but wouldn't help us because he "works in the back" and clearly was preoccupied. I'm not sure what kind of work was going on there all I know is if my pizza wasn't free I wouldn't have given them my business and will not going forward. So if your looking for a minimum wage paying job where you get paid to just do your own thing and maybe participate in running a pizza through the oven every so often; I highly recommend this place. But from a customer service point of view, how this place is still open is beyond me. They have some serious employee revisions to make.

Review: I honestly would rather have consistently decent food and pizza hut provides that experience for me. I can always depend on a decent meal in 2024 and thats all I ask for! Thank you. 

You are better than all of these inconsistent places. Its been getting ridiculous in the fast food world.

Review: I give this 5 stars due to the fact that they are quick with orders and delivering on a timely manner. Even when they made a mistake they fix the issue with solutions and not leave you disappointed. I personally have had a great experience at this Pizza Hut

Review: It's Pizza Hut. I order last minute for delivery or pickup and the pizza is ready in 20-30 min. Can't tell you what the ambiance is because I never go in. Either it shows up at my door or I pull up and they put it in my car. Pizza always tastes like Pizza Hut and the original crust is always buttery. Why 5 star? Because I don't go order Pizza Hut delivery expecting it to be some gourmet pizza. It shows up for parties and football games to go with copious amounts of beer.

Review: What a pleasant surprise... Pizza Hut is back in the game. I have not ordered in a while but decided to give another try after over a year and boy I am glad I did. That was the most delicious pizza I have had in a very long time. It was so hot it burned the roof of my mouth a bit... lol
Thank you for stepping up your game and making an excellent pizza and it was also delivered on time. Great Job everyone!!!

Review: Only giving 2 stars for prompt delivery & taste. Ordered a make your own supreme/meat pizza and it was delicious.

Unfortunately, there was a rock-like substance that was easily mistaken for a piece of black olive, which almost broke my tooth.

Not the best for a $33 pizza.

Review: Deserves no star rating. ordered online with curbside pickup. Waited at curb for 20 minutes after order due time. Not a clue about customer service here. Ordered wings & pizza. Wings were tough and stale. Like made a week ago and stuck on the back counter for some sucker to order. Pizza was absolutely FOUL. stale with disgusting cardboard tasting thin crust. Half of pizza had pepperoni - they put all of 4 slices on it. 
I have been buying pizza for decades in NY, Chicago & everywhere in between, I will never ever buy anything from Pizza Butt again. Take my advice - buy store bought and make it yourself. Pizza Butt needs to be driven out of business.

Review: Online says they're open but when I pulled up there's a handwritten sign that says "sorry we're closed." 

When I looked to the right (door where they take that trash out, exit for delivery, etc) there's a few employees sitting there smoking  cigs.  

My initial frustrated thoughts were why are they closed but when I saw the employees (looking careless and washed up) casually puffing on their cigs I thought... this must be a sign from God. 

I think that'll be my last visit to there.  I'm an 80's baby and I remember when Pizza Hut used to dominate the industry... times have surely changed that.

Review: I'm giving a very deep sigh right now. I wanted pizza and I thought about Pizza Hut. Well I usually don't even bother with this location. I either go to the food stand in Target, or drive 10 minutes to the one on Dallas Parkway in Frisco. Well it's been a long day and I didn't feel like driving, and the stand at Target was probably closing soon. Soooo, I had an ounce of hope that the Ohio Drive location got better. W-R-O-N-G..... I'm also babysitting and even the kids were turned off. I don't know if they were running out of cheese, but they could've thrown another fistful on there. The piled plenty of Hut Flavor seasoning on the crust. It's greasy and goopy. The sauce tastes watered down.. I should've just went to Target. They have 9 inch personal pans now! I'm officially done with this location.

Review: ZERO STARS!!! Tonight I ordered online for my pizza and two Hersheys's chocolate chip cookie for delivery at 9pm. I put directions down how to get into my neighborhood and left my house phone number. Waited for the delivery pizza guy to come. Noticing the pizza hut delivery was talking a bit to long. I called the pizza hut place at 10:30pm to see my order is on its way. The person on the phone said it will be there soon. I waited a half an hour at 11:30pm.  

At this point I'm getting fed up waiting for my order that I ordered. I called the Pizza Hut place again. I give them my online order number and my address. The guy on the phone tells me the pizza hut delivery guy called my house phone and got no response and they told me I put down the wrong phone number I gave them. No I didn't put the wrong house number down because I always check for that stuff when I'm ordering online for food. Plus if you call only one time and get no response. Shouldn't you call that phone number again just to make sure? Then just assuming you called the wrong phone number?

Plus the guy on the phone told me they don't deliver into my area because it's to far away from the driver and they might of changed the delivery route!  
ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!  You pizza hut guys are located only 10 minutes from my neighborhood and you tell me you can't deliver the food that I ordered?! Because its to far away from pizza delivery guy liking?!

The guy on the phone asked have they delivered to my address before?
I told the guy on the phone yes you have many times!

Then guy on the phone then said since they got no response from the phone number I gave them and the area to my neighborhood was to far away... The delivery guy had to return the order that I was waiting for back to the pizza hut place and had to let the delivery guy go for night. They guy said sorry and then hanged up the phone.

IDIOTS!! THANK YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME AND PATIENTCE FOR YOUR PATHETIC EXCUSES!! IT'S A BUNCH OF BULLS#&T!

Review: Our work group came today. We ordered pizza, wings, and bread sticks. Everything was perfectly cooked and the service was spot on. The supreme pizza has a few less toppings than I expected, and the veggie just did not have a great flavor, and I always like veggie. They also serve pepsi instead of Coke, bummer. It is dark and outdated inside, needs a big update.

Review: Tonight I went to eat at this Pizza Hut location. Upon walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant. I asked for a menu review. Afterward, I stood at the counter to provide my order as a man was being helped in front of me. Shortly, another gentleman walk into the store and stood in line. After the man in front of me walks away, the employee skips me and proceeds to assist the gentleman who walked in after I was already in line.  While that was already annoying, I never interrupted and waited.  After that gentleman walks away, the employee fumbles with a few pens and a receipt and never makes eye contact with me, even though I was less than 3 feet away from him. After waiting for around 30-45 seconds for the employee to make eye contact, he asked "what is your name" and what he could do for me. I told him that he skipped me to help a man who was behind me in line and the response was, "uh, ok."  Then I proceeded to be annoyed and expressed that he ignored me even after the last gentleman was helped walked away. Again, he responded with "uh, ok." That is when I got upset and responded with "no, that's not ok," followed by a firm stare.

In addition, this employee failed to ask me if it is dine in or take out.  As a result, I was given the pizza in a box, even though I was dining in. The pizza was brought out by another employee in a dine on a dine in plate, the main employee at issue brought our my wings in a bag and to go box.  Why would he do that AFTER seeing that my pizza was being brought out on a dine in plate and I was sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  This employee has zero self awareness and ability to process information.  

Based on the above stated facts, it is hard to argue that this location has very poor customer service. The employee in question is Keya. He is either mentally challenged, undertrained or simply has zero work ethic. If he doesn't want to work, then don't get a job, proceed to play video games at home and rely on mom and dad.  Either way, this Pizza Hut location a substandard choice for a pizza outing because of him and I would not recommend this location to anyone.

Review: Worst experience. Very rude and unprofessional staff. Make mistakes in orders and give attitude of call to complaint. They make pizza with large side crust to save on cheese and pizza sauce and of course toppings. Don't go there.

Review: I wish I could give no star. Had multiple bad experience with this location and now finally pushed me to write review. So, to start with if you go online it says store is closed and takes me to pre order. I had to call store to put order the guy I talked to said online is closed because we don't have internet, fair enough reason? I placed my order and total comes out subtotal 6.50 so they denied delivery, this review is for Pizza Hut itself now. Minimum delivery? So I asked what is minimum and he said $10. I checked online if he was right and site said $7.99. So liers and unprofessional full of employees at this location. Definitely not ordering ever. Manager Andy seem to have no concern whatsoever.

Review: This used to be our favorite carry out place but for the last couple of months the service has turned horrible.They never put the toppings correctly,pizza is thin for a pan crust & the breadsticks were so hard that we had to throw them away.Waste of money & waste of time.Will never order at this location again.

Review: Pizza was great but there's a blonde employee who's always on her phone and isn't professional . Heaven help you if you need a drink if you dine in. .. or phone in an order.  We dined in and it appears only 25% of phone calls were answered. Plus we never got a refill

Review: Had dinner here with my family. Our server was very good, and she always had a friendly smile. Our 2 medium pizzas (both half-n-half, one with no sauce) came out quickly and were cooked right.  Great pizza. The server had our cinnamon sticks out just at the right time. The only negatives were some crumbs on a couple tables, and the small restrooms are pretty dated .. could use a restroom make-over.

Review: Absolute worst pizza I have ever had.  I should have saved my money and made a frozen totinos pizza.  Pizza was cold upon delivery and all shook up inside the box.  Pan crust was thinner than the thin crust . . . Ended up throwing it away.  Will never order from here again. Only picked 1 star because it made me . . . .

Review: Nothing irritates me more than wasting my time. I ordered online to pickup two pizzas, cheese sticks and a 2 liter. I go to pick it up at the designated time (45 minutes after I placed the order) and their credit card system is down and they tell me to go next door to get cash. 45 minutes had lapsed since I had placed my online order which required me to include both my phone number and email address. You couldn't contact me and tell me that before I got there? I had hungry kids in the car and a sick hubby at home and had to go find an atm machine while my order sat there getting cold. Very disappointed and not the way to treat your customers! I relayed my frustration to the employee who had no interest in rectifying the situation. I understand things happen, but how difficult is it to communicate issues to your customers? Time to find a new Pizza Hut.

Review: Ordered a supreme pizza on thin and crispy crust with an order of the cinnamon sticks. The pizza was cold and soggy. Terrible. The cinnamon sticks were good. Never will order from them again. I am down the street and took 50 minutes to get the stuff. Driver said they were slow, so they were not busy.

Review: Zero stars! Just ordered from this location and they delivered sloppy COLD pizza with barely any cheese. This location is sloppy and has very bad customer service. Will be contacting corporate. You can't run a store to serve clean warm food then stay out of business instead of wasting people's time and money! Don't ever order from this store. Oh and they never answer the phone.

Review: Had the worst experience ever with this store. The canceled my order arbitrarily 5m after I placed it because it was 30m before store close. They never informed me, and when I called to find out why the order was late, they said they did not have it in their system and there was nothing they could do. I told them I had even been charged for it and the attendant told me to stop by tomorrow to get reimbursed. I called my credit card and found out THEY had done a reverse charge on my card, which proves they did cancel the order on purpose. I am pregnant, we literally just moved and had no food in the house. Never recommend this store to anyone.

Review: Can I give them a -5 stars?  This is the 3rd, count them, not the 1st, not the 2nd, THE THIRD time I have ordered a delivery from this store.  EACH TIME, they have been a minimum of 20 minutes late, past the time I requested the order to be delivered.  I'm not ordering during their rush hour - I have placed the order hours, if not days, prior to when I need it.  This last time, I called the store at 10:25am (before they "opened for business").  No one answered the phone until 10:35am.  I was very specific in stating that I needed it here by 11:30am AT THE LATEST.  At 11:40am, I was calling the store.  Got sent to some operator who then switched me over to the store.  Some girl/lady started arguing with me on the phone about the order!  Then she put me on "hold" which was basically disconnecting the call (i.e. HUNG UP ON ME).  I called back - went somewhere with a recording of "we are having technical difficulties"!  WTH?  I called back again, and again.  Told the lady that the order was for 11:30 and now it was 11:50.  Her response?  Click.  What time did the delivery guy walk in?  12:05PM!!!  This wasn't a big order - 3 pizzas and breadsticks.  Didn't even bother them for drinks!  He was so casual, I swear he could have been high.  When I told him he was late, he was like "well, I'm new."  (Sorry dude, you were "new" last month.)  When I asked for the managers' name, he responded with "why?" - "Why? Because you're over a 1/2 hour late!  That's why! Tell your manager that I'm calling your corporate offices because OBVIOUSLY she can't run a store!"  When I asked if I had to sign something (the receipt) he's like "yeah."  "Do you have a pen?"  "Nah, someone stole it from me. Do you have one?"  

FYI - My uncle owns a whole group of Pizza Huts (not in this area) - if this would have been one of his stores, well - first of all, he wouldn't hire idiots like these, secondly, if by accident a few slipped in - they would have been fired for this behavior.  You're losing business and money, Pizza Hut on Ohio Dr.  I feel like Taylor Swift because we ARE NEVER, EVER, EVER ordering from you again!

Afterward, I stood at the counter to provide my order as a man was being helped in front of me. Shortly, another gentleman walk into the store and stood in line. After the man in front of me walks away, the employee skips me and proceeds to assist the gentleman who walked in after I was already in line.  While that was already annoying, I never interrupted and waited.  After that gentleman walks away, the employee fumbles with a few pens and a receipt and never makes eye contact with me, even though I was less than 3 feet away from him. After waiting for around 30-45 seconds for the employee to make eye contact, he asked "what is your name" and what he could do for me. I told him that he skipped me to help a man who was behind me in line and the response was, "uh, ok."  Then I proceeded to be annoyed and expressed that he ignored me even after the last gentleman was helped walked away. Again, he responded with "uh, ok." That is when I got upset and responded with "no, that's not ok," followed by a firm stare.

In addition, this employee failed to ask me if it is dine in or take out.  As a result, I was given the pizza in a box, even though I was dining in. The pizza was brought out by another employee in a dine on a dine in plate, the main employee at issue brought our my wings in a bag and to go box.  Why would he do that AFTER seeing that my pizza was being brought out on a dine in plate and I was sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  This employee has zero self awareness and ability to process information.  

Based on the above stated facts, it is hard to argue that this location has very poor customer service. The employee in question is Keya. He is either mentally challenged, undertrained or simply has zero work ethic. If he doesn't want to work, then don't get a job, proceed to play video games at home and rely on mom and dad.  Either way, this Pizza Hut location a substandard choice for a pizza outing because of him and I would not recommend this location to anyone.

Review: Worst experience. Very rude and unprofessional staff. Make mistakes in orders and give attitude of call to complaint. They make pizza with large side crust to save on cheese and pizza sauce and of course toppings. Don't go there.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: I wish I could give no star. Had multiple bad experience with this location and now finally pushed me to write review. So, to start with if you go online it says store is closed and takes me to pre order. I had to call store to put order the guy I talked to said online is closed because we don't have internet, fair enough reason? I placed my order and total comes out subtotal 6.50 so they denied delivery, this review is for Pizza Hut itself now. Minimum delivery? So I asked what is minimum and he said $10. I checked online if he was right and site said $7.99. So liers and unprofessional full of employees at this location. Definitely not ordering ever. Manager Andy seem to have no concern whatsoever.

Review: This used to be our favorite carry out place but for the last couple of months the service has turned horrible.They never put the toppings correctly,pizza is thin for a pan crust & the breadsticks were so hard that we had to throw them away.Waste of money & waste of time.Will never order at this location again.

Review: Pizza was great but there's a blonde employee who's always on her phone and isn't professional . Heaven help you if you need a drink if you dine in. .. or phone in an order.  We dined in and it appears only 25% of phone calls were answered. Plus we never got a refill

Review: Had dinner here with my family. Our server was very good, and she always had a friendly smile. Our 2 medium pizzas (both half-n-half, one with no sauce) came out quickly and were cooked right.  Great pizza. The server had our cinnamon sticks out just at the right time. The only negatives were some crumbs on a couple tables, and the small restrooms are pretty dated .. could use a restroom make-over.

Review: Absolute worst pizza I have ever had.  I should have saved my money and made a frozen totinos pizza.  Pizza was cold upon delivery and all shook up inside the box.  Pan crust was thinner than the thin crust . . . Ended up throwing it away.  Will never order from here again. Only picked 1 star because it made me . . . .

Review: Nothing irritates me more than wasting my time. I ordered online to pickup two pizzas, cheese sticks and a 2 liter. I go to pick it up at the designated time (45 minutes after I placed the order) and their credit card system is down and they tell me to go next door to get cash. 45 minutes had lapsed since I had placed my online order which required me to include both my phone number and email address. You couldn't contact me and tell me that before I got there? I had hungry kids in the car and a sick hubby at home and had to go find an atm machine while my order sat there getting cold. Very disappointed and not the way to treat your customers! I relayed my frustration to the employee who had no interest in rectifying the situation. I understand things happen, but how difficult is it to communicate issues to your customers? Time to find a new Pizza Hut.

Review: Ordered a supreme pizza on thin and crispy crust with an order of the cinnamon sticks. The pizza was cold and soggy. Terrible. The cinnamon sticks were good. Never will order from them again. I am down the street and took 50 minutes to get the stuff. Driver said they were slow, so they were not busy.

Review: Zero stars! Just ordered from this location and they delivered sloppy COLD pizza with barely any cheese. This location is sloppy and has very bad customer service. Will be contacting corporate. You can't run a store to serve clean warm food then stay out of business instead of wasting people's time and money! Don't ever order from this store. Oh and they never answer the phone.

Review: Had the worst experience ever with this store. The canceled my order arbitrarily 5m after I placed it because it was 30m before store close. They never informed me, and when I called to find out why the order was late, they said they did not have it in their system and there was nothing they could do. I told them I had even been charged for it and the attendant told me to stop by tomorrow to get reimbursed. I called my credit card and found out THEY had done a reverse charge on my card, which proves they did cancel the order on purpose. I am pregnant, we literally just moved and had no food in the house. Never recommend this store to anyone.

Review: Can I give them a -5 stars?  This is the 3rd, count them, not the 1st, not the 2nd, THE THIRD time I have ordered a delivery from this store.  EACH TIME, they have been a minimum of 20 minutes late, past the time I requested the order to be delivered.  I'm not ordering during their rush hour - I have placed the order hours, if not days, prior to when I need it.  This last time, I called the store at 10:25am (before they "opened for business").  No one answered the phone until 10:35am.  I was very specific in stating that I needed it here by 11:30am AT THE LATEST.  At 11:40am, I was calling the store.  Got sent to some operator who then switched me over to the store.  Some girl/lady started arguing with me on the phone about the order!  Then she put me on "hold" which was basically disconnecting the call (i.e. HUNG UP ON ME).  I called back - went somewhere with a recording of "we are having technical difficulties"!  WTH?  I called back again, and again.  Told the lady that the order was for 11:30 and now it was 11:50.  Her response?  Click.  What time did the delivery guy walk in?  12:05PM!!!  This wasn't a big order - 3 pizzas and breadsticks.  Didn't even bother them for drinks!  He was so casual, I swear he could have been high.  When I told him he was late, he was like "well, I'm new."  (Sorry dude, you were "new" last month.)  When I asked for the managers' name, he responded with "why?" - "Why? Because you're over a 1/2 hour late!  That's why! Tell your manager that I'm calling your corporate offices because OBVIOUSLY she can't run a store!"  When I asked if I had to sign something (the receipt) he's like "yeah."  "Do you have a pen?"  "Nah, someone stole it from me. Do you have one?"  

FYI - My uncle owns a whole group of Pizza Huts (not in this area) - if this would have been one of his stores, well - first of all, he wouldn't hire idiots like these, secondly, if by accident a few slipped in - they would have been fired for this behavior.  You're losing business and money, Pizza Hut on Ohio Dr.  I feel like Taylor Swift because we ARE NEVER, EVER, EVER ordering from you again!

Review: After waiting 10 minutes to place an order (being the only two people in the place) we were finally asked if we needed to order. In that ten minute span at least 9 employees walked by seeing someone at the front desk two of them actually said something to us along the lines of "oh there are people here" and "I don't know where anything is they lost the key". 3 employees were screaming at each other just on the other side of the swinging door, another arguing with his mom on the phone at the front counter but wouldn't help us because he "works in the back" and clearly was preoccupied. I'm not sure what kind of work was going on there all I know is if my pizza wasn't free I wouldn't have given them my business and will not going forward. So if your looking for a minimum wage paying job where you get paid to just do your own thing and maybe participate in running a pizza through the oven every so often; I highly recommend this place. But from a customer service point of view, how this place is still open is beyond me. They have some serious employee revisions to make.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I honestly would rather have consistently decent food and pizza hut provides that experience for me. I can always depend on a decent meal in 2024 and thats all I ask for! Thank you. 

You are better than all of these inconsistent places. Its been getting ridiculous in the fast food world.

Review: Unmitigated disaster in terms of how long the food took.  Didn't seem that busy but waited in drive thru for a personal pan pizza and wings for 20 minutes.

Review: I give this 5 stars due to the fact that they are quick with orders and delivering on a timely manner. Even when they made a mistake they fix the issue with solutions and not leave you disappointed. I personally have had a great experience at this Pizza Hut

Review: It's Pizza Hut. I order last minute for delivery or pickup and the pizza is ready in 20-30 min. Can't tell you what the ambiance is because I never go in. Either it shows up at my door or I pull up and they put it in my car. Pizza always tastes like Pizza Hut and the original crust is always buttery. Why 5 star? Because I don't go order Pizza Hut delivery expecting it to be some gourmet pizza. It shows up for parties and football games to go with copious amounts of beer.

Review: What a pleasant surprise... Pizza Hut is back in the game. I have not ordered in a while but decided to give another try after over a year and boy I am glad I did. That was the most delicious pizza I have had in a very long time. It was so hot it burned the roof of my mouth a bit... lol
Thank you for stepping up your game and making an excellent pizza and it was also delivered on time. Great Job everyone!!!

Review: Only giving 2 stars for prompt delivery & taste. Ordered a make your own supreme/meat pizza and it was delicious.

Unfortunately, there was a rock-like substance that was easily mistaken for a piece of black olive, which almost broke my tooth.

Not the best for a $33 pizza.

Review: Deserves no star rating. ordered online with curbside pickup. Waited at curb for 20 minutes after order due time. Not a clue about customer service here. Ordered wings & pizza. Wings were tough and stale. Like made a week ago and stuck on the back counter for some sucker to order. Pizza was absolutely FOUL. stale with disgusting cardboard tasting thin crust. Half of pizza had pepperoni - they put all of 4 slices on it. 
I have been buying pizza for decades in NY, Chicago & everywhere in between, I will never ever buy anything from Pizza Butt again. Take my advice - buy store bought and make it yourself. Pizza Butt needs to be driven out of business.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: Cardboard with tomato sauce and garlic would of tasted better. I remember when pizza hut was good. Sorry cannot do this anymore. A frozen pizza from Wal Mart is much better. Dont waste your money. Ever since the chinese have bought KFC,Taco Bell and Pizza Hut the food is not worth eating.

Review: Online says they're open but when I pulled up there's a handwritten sign that says "sorry we're closed." 

When I looked to the right (door where they take that trash out, exit for delivery, etc) there's a few employees sitting there smoking  cigs.  

My initial frustrated thoughts were why are they closed but when I saw the employees (looking careless and washed up) casually puffing on their cigs I thought... this must be a sign from God. 

I think that'll be my last visit to there.  I'm an 80's baby and I remember when Pizza Hut used to dominate the industry... times have surely changed that.

Review: I'm giving a very deep sigh right now. I wanted pizza and I thought about Pizza Hut. Well I usually don't even bother with this location. I either go to the food stand in Target, or drive 10 minutes to the one on Dallas Parkway in Frisco. Well it's been a long day and I didn't feel like driving, and the stand at Target was probably closing soon. Soooo, I had an ounce of hope that the Ohio Drive location got better. W-R-O-N-G..... I'm also babysitting and even the kids were turned off. I don't know if they were running out of cheese, but they could've thrown another fistful on there. The piled plenty of Hut Flavor seasoning on the crust. It's greasy and goopy. The sauce tastes watered down.. I should've just went to Target. They have 9 inch personal pans now! I'm officially done with this location.

Review: The pizza was ready in 15 minutes, so that should've been enough of a warning.  The first bite immediately felt stale, and the crust was doughy and the cheese was congealed.  All in all it tasted like moldy bread.

Review: ZERO STARS!!! Tonight I ordered online for my pizza and two Hersheys's chocolate chip cookie for delivery at 9pm. I put directions down how to get into my neighborhood and left my house phone number. Waited for the delivery pizza guy to come. Noticing the pizza hut delivery was talking a bit to long. I called the pizza hut place at 10:30pm to see my order is on its way. The person on the phone said it will be there soon. I waited a half an hour at 11:30pm.  

At this point I'm getting fed up waiting for my order that I ordered. I called the Pizza Hut place again. I give them my online order number and my address. The guy on the phone tells me the pizza hut delivery guy called my house phone and got no response and they told me I put down the wrong phone number I gave them. No I didn't put the wrong house number down because I always check for that stuff when I'm ordering online for food. Plus if you call only one time and get no response. Shouldn't you call that phone number again just to make sure? Then just assuming you called the wrong phone number?

Plus the guy on the phone told me they don't deliver into my area because it's to far away from the driver and they might of changed the delivery route!  
ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!  You pizza hut guys are located only 10 minutes from my neighborhood and you tell me you can't deliver the food that I ordered?! Because its to far away from pizza delivery guy liking?!

The guy on the phone asked have they delivered to my address before?
I told the guy on the phone yes you have many times!

Then guy on the phone then said since they got no response from the phone number I gave them and the area to my neighborhood was to far away... The delivery guy had to return the order that I was waiting for back to the pizza hut place and had to let the delivery guy go for night. They guy said sorry and then hanged up the phone.

IDIOTS!! THANK YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME AND PATIENTCE FOR YOUR PATHETIC EXCUSES!! IT'S A BUNCH OF BULLS#&T!

Review: Our work group came today. We ordered pizza, wings, and bread sticks. Everything was perfectly cooked and the service was spot on. The supreme pizza has a few less toppings than I expected, and the veggie just did not have a great flavor, and I always like veggie. They also serve pepsi instead of Coke, bummer. It is dark and outdated inside, needs a big update.

Review: After waiting 10 minutes to place an order (being the only two people in the place) we were finally asked if we needed to order. In that ten minute span at least 9 employees walked by seeing someone at the front desk two of them actually said something to us along the lines of "oh there are people here" and "I don't know where anything is they lost the key". 3 employees were screaming at each other just on the other side of the swinging door, another arguing with his mom on the phone at the front counter but wouldn't help us because he "works in the back" and clearly was preoccupied. I'm not sure what kind of work was going on there all I know is if my pizza wasn't free I wouldn't have given them my business and will not going forward. So if your looking for a minimum wage paying job where you get paid to just do your own thing and maybe participate in running a pizza through the oven every so often; I highly recommend this place. But from a customer service point of view, how this place is still open is beyond me. They have some serious employee revisions to make.

Review: I honestly would rather have consistently decent food and pizza hut provides that experience for me. I can always depend on a decent meal in 2024 and thats all I ask for! Thank you.

Review: It's Pizza Hut. I order last minute for delivery or pickup and the pizza is ready in 20-30 min. Can't tell you what the ambiance is because I never go in. Either it shows up at my door or I pull up and they put it in my car. Pizza always tastes like Pizza Hut and the original crust is always buttery. Why 5 star? Because I don't go order Pizza Hut delivery expecting it to be some gourmet pizza. It shows up for parties and football games to go with copious amounts of beer.

Thank you for stepping up your game and making an excellent pizza and it was also delivered on time. Great Job everyone!!!

Review: Only giving 2 stars for prompt delivery & taste. Ordered a make your own supreme/meat pizza and it was delicious.

Unfortunately, there was a rock-like substance that was easily mistaken for a piece of black olive, which almost broke my tooth.

Review: Deserves no star rating. ordered online with curbside pickup. Waited at curb for 20 minutes after order due time. Not a clue about customer service here. Ordered wings & pizza. Wings were tough and stale. Like made a week ago and stuck on the back counter for some sucker to order. Pizza was absolutely FOUL. stale with disgusting cardboard tasting thin crust. Half of pizza had pepperoni - they put all of 4 slices on it. 
I have been buying pizza for decades in NY, Chicago & everywhere in between, I will never ever buy anything from Pizza Butt again. Take my advice - buy store bought and make it yourself. Pizza Butt needs to be driven out of business.

Review: Online says they're open but when I pulled up there's a handwritten sign that says "sorry we're closed." 

When I looked to the right (door where they take that trash out, exit for delivery, etc) there's a few employees sitting there smoking  cigs.  

My initial frustrated thoughts were why are they closed but when I saw the employees (looking careless and washed up) casually puffing on their cigs I thought... this must be a sign from God. 

I think that'll be my last visit to there.  I'm an 80's baby and I remember when Pizza Hut used to dominate the industry... times have surely changed that.

Review: I'm giving a very deep sigh right now. I wanted pizza and I thought about Pizza Hut. Well I usually don't even bother with this location. I either go to the food stand in Target, or drive 10 minutes to the one on Dallas Parkway in Frisco. Well it's been a long day and I didn't feel like driving, and the stand at Target was probably closing soon. Soooo, I had an ounce of hope that the Ohio Drive location got better. W-R-O-N-G..... I'm also babysitting and even the kids were turned off. I don't know if they were running out of cheese, but they could've thrown another fistful on there. The piled plenty of Hut Flavor seasoning on the crust. It's greasy and goopy. The sauce tastes watered down.. I should've just went to Target. They have 9 inch personal pans now! I'm officially done with this location.

Review: ZERO STARS!!! Tonight I ordered online for my pizza and two Hersheys's chocolate chip cookie for delivery at 9pm. I put directions down how to get into my neighborhood and left my house phone number. Waited for the delivery pizza guy to come. Noticing the pizza hut delivery was talking a bit to long. I called the pizza hut place at 10:30pm to see my order is on its way. The person on the phone said it will be there soon. I waited a half an hour at 11:30pm.  

At this point I'm getting fed up waiting for my order that I ordered. I called the Pizza Hut place again. I give them my online order number and my address. The guy on the phone tells me the pizza hut delivery guy called my house phone and got no response and they told me I put down the wrong phone number I gave them. No I didn't put the wrong house number down because I always check for that stuff when I'm ordering online for food. Plus if you call only one time and get no response. Shouldn't you call that phone number again just to make sure? Then just assuming you called the wrong phone number?

Plus the guy on the phone told me they don't deliver into my area because it's to far away from the driver and they might of changed the delivery route!  
ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!  You pizza hut guys are located only 10 minutes from my neighborhood and you tell me you can't deliver the food that I ordered?! Because its to far away from pizza delivery guy liking?!

The guy on the phone asked have they delivered to my address before?
I told the guy on the phone yes you have many times!

Then guy on the phone then said since they got no response from the phone number I gave them and the area to my neighborhood was to far away... The delivery guy had to return the order that I was waiting for back to the pizza hut place and had to let the delivery guy go for night. They guy said sorry and then hanged up the phone.

IDIOTS!! THANK YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME AND PATIENTCE FOR YOUR PATHETIC EXCUSES!! IT'S A BUNCH OF BULLS#&T!

Review: Our work group came today. We ordered pizza, wings, and bread sticks. Everything was perfectly cooked and the service was spot on. The supreme pizza has a few less toppings than I expected, and the veggie just did not have a great flavor, and I always like veggie. They also serve pepsi instead of Coke, bummer. It is dark and outdated inside, needs a big update.

Review: Tonight I went to eat at this Pizza Hut location. Upon walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant. I asked for a menu review. Afterward, I stood at the counter to provide my order as a man was being helped in front of me. Shortly, another gentleman walk into the store and stood in line. After the man in front of me walks away, the employee skips me and proceeds to assist the gentleman who walked in after I was already in line.  While that was already annoying, I never interrupted and waited.  After that gentleman walks away, the employee fumbles with a few pens and a receipt and never makes eye contact with me, even though I was less than 3 feet away from him. After waiting for around 30-45 seconds for the employee to make eye contact, he asked "what is your name" and what he could do for me. I told him that he skipped me to help a man who was behind me in line and the response was, "uh, ok."  Then I proceeded to be annoyed and expressed that he ignored me even after the last gentleman was helped walked away. Again, he responded with "uh, ok." That is when I got upset and responded with "no, that's not ok," followed by a firm stare.

In addition, this employee failed to ask me if it is dine in or take out.  As a result, I was given the pizza in a box, even though I was dining in. The pizza was brought out by another employee in a dine on a dine in plate, the main employee at issue brought our my wings in a bag and to go box.  Why would he do that AFTER seeing that my pizza was being brought out on a dine in plate and I was sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  This employee has zero self awareness and ability to process information.  

Based on the above stated facts, it is hard to argue that this location has very poor customer service. The employee in question is Keya. He is either mentally challenged, undertrained or simply has zero work ethic. If he doesn't want to work, then don't get a job, proceed to play video games at home and rely on mom and dad.  Either way, this Pizza Hut location a substandard choice for a pizza outing because of him and I would not recommend this location to anyone.

Review: Worst experience. Very rude and unprofessional staff. Make mistakes in orders and give attitude of call to complaint. They make pizza with large side crust to save on cheese and pizza sauce and of course toppings. Don't go there.

Review: I wish I could give no star. Had multiple bad experience with this location and now finally pushed me to write review. So, to start with if you go online it says store is closed and takes me to pre order. I had to call store to put order the guy I talked to said online is closed because we don't have internet, fair enough reason? I placed my order and total comes out subtotal 6.50 so they denied delivery, this review is for Pizza Hut itself now. Minimum delivery? So I asked what is minimum and he said $10. I checked online if he was right and site said $7.99. So liers and unprofessional full of employees at this location. Definitely not ordering ever. Manager Andy seem to have no concern whatsoever.

Review: This used to be our favorite carry out place but for the last couple of months the service has turned horrible.They never put the toppings correctly,pizza is thin for a pan crust & the breadsticks were so hard that we had to throw them away.Waste of money & waste of time.Will never order at this location again.

Review: Pizza was great but there's a blonde employee who's always on her phone and isn't professional . Heaven help you if you need a drink if you dine in. .. or phone in an order.  We dined in and it appears only 25% of phone calls were answered. Plus we never got a refill

Review: Had dinner here with my family. Our server was very good, and she always had a friendly smile. Our 2 medium pizzas (both half-n-half, one with no sauce) came out quickly and were cooked right.  Great pizza. The server had our cinnamon sticks out just at the right time. The only negatives were some crumbs on a couple tables, and the small restrooms are pretty dated .. could use a restroom make-over.

Review: Absolute worst pizza I have ever had.  I should have saved my money and made a frozen totinos pizza.  Pizza was cold upon delivery and all shook up inside the box.  Pan crust was thinner than the thin crust . . . Ended up throwing it away.  Will never order from here again. Only picked 1 star because it made me . . . .

Review: Nothing irritates me more than wasting my time. I ordered online to pickup two pizzas, cheese sticks and a 2 liter. I go to pick it up at the designated time (45 minutes after I placed the order) and their credit card system is down and they tell me to go next door to get cash. 45 minutes had lapsed since I had placed my online order which required me to include both my phone number and email address. You couldn't contact me and tell me that before I got there? I had hungry kids in the car and a sick hubby at home and had to go find an atm machine while my order sat there getting cold. Very disappointed and not the way to treat your customers! I relayed my frustration to the employee who had no interest in rectifying the situation. I understand things happen, but how difficult is it to communicate issues to your customers? Time to find a new Pizza Hut.

Review: Ordered a supreme pizza on thin and crispy crust with an order of the cinnamon sticks. The pizza was cold and soggy. Terrible. The cinnamon sticks were good. Never will order from them again. I am down the street and took 50 minutes to get the stuff. Driver said they were slow, so they were not busy.

Review: Zero stars! Just ordered from this location and they delivered sloppy COLD pizza with barely any cheese. This location is sloppy and has very bad customer service. Will be contacting corporate. You can't run a store to serve clean warm food then stay out of business instead of wasting people's time and money! Don't ever order from this store. Oh and they never answer the phone.

Review: Had the worst experience ever with this store. The canceled my order arbitrarily 5m after I placed it because it was 30m before store close. They never informed me, and when I called to find out why the order was late, they said they did not have it in their system and there was nothing they could do. I told them I had even been charged for it and the attendant told me to stop by tomorrow to get reimbursed. I called my credit card and found out THEY had done a reverse charge on my card, which proves they did cancel the order on purpose. I am pregnant, we literally just moved and had no food in the house. Never recommend this store to anyone.

Review: Can I give them a -5 stars?  This is the 3rd, count them, not the 1st, not the 2nd, THE THIRD time I have ordered a delivery from this store.  EACH TIME, they have been a minimum of 20 minutes late, past the time I requested the order to be delivered.  I'm not ordering during their rush hour - I have placed the order hours, if not days, prior to when I need it.  This last time, I called the store at 10:25am (before they "opened for business").  No one answered the phone until 10:35am.  I was very specific in stating that I needed it here by 11:30am AT THE LATEST.  At 11:40am, I was calling the store.  Got sent to some operator who then switched me over to the store.  Some girl/lady started arguing with me on the phone about the order!  Then she put me on "hold" which was basically disconnecting the call (i.e. HUNG UP ON ME).  I called back - went somewhere with a recording of "we are having technical difficulties"!  WTH?  I called back again, and again.  Told the lady that the order was for 11:30 and now it was 11:50.  Her response?  Click.  What time did the delivery guy walk in?  12:05PM!!!  This wasn't a big order - 3 pizzas and breadsticks.  Didn't even bother them for drinks!  He was so casual, I swear he could have been high.  When I told him he was late, he was like "well, I'm new."  (Sorry dude, you were "new" last month.)  When I asked for the managers' name, he responded with "why?" - "Why? Because you're over a 1/2 hour late!  That's why! Tell your manager that I'm calling your corporate offices because OBVIOUSLY she can't run a store!"  When I asked if I had to sign something (the receipt) he's like "yeah."  "Do you have a pen?"  "Nah, someone stole it from me. Do you have one?"  

FYI - My uncle owns a whole group of Pizza Huts (not in this area) - if this would have been one of his stores, well - first of all, he wouldn't hire idiots like these, secondly, if by accident a few slipped in - they would have been fired for this behavior.  You're losing business and money, Pizza Hut on Ohio Dr.  I feel like Taylor Swift because we ARE NEVER, EVER, EVER ordering from you again!

Review: Our work group came today. We ordered pizza, wings, and bread sticks. Everything was perfectly cooked and the service was spot on. The supreme pizza has a few less toppings than I expected, and the veggie just did not have a great flavor, and I always like veggie. They also serve pepsi instead of Coke, bummer. It is dark and outdated inside, needs a big update.

Review: Ordered pizza, 50 min wait. One pizza completely wrong, the other had random mushrooms on it incorrectly. Had to wait another 30 min for the right pizza to be delivered and not a great customer service experience when I explained the error.

Review: Tonight I went to eat at this Pizza Hut location. Upon walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant. I asked for a menu review. Afterward, I stood at the counter to provide my order as a man was being helped in front of me. Shortly, another gentleman walk into the store and stood in line. After the man in front of me walks away, the employee skips me and proceeds to assist the gentleman who walked in after I was already in line.  While that was already annoying, I never interrupted and waited.  After that gentleman walks away, the employee fumbles with a few pens and a receipt and never makes eye contact with me, even though I was less than 3 feet away from him. After waiting for around 30-45 seconds for the employee to make eye contact, he asked "what is your name" and what he could do for me. I told him that he skipped me to help a man who was behind me in line and the response was, "uh, ok."  Then I proceeded to be annoyed and expressed that he ignored me even after the last gentleman was helped walked away. Again, he responded with "uh, ok." That is when I got upset and responded with "no, that's not ok," followed by a firm stare.

In addition, this employee failed to ask me if it is dine in or take out.  As a result, I was given the pizza in a box, even though I was dining in. The pizza was brought out by another employee in a dine on a dine in plate, the main employee at issue brought our my wings in a bag and to go box.  Why would he do that AFTER seeing that my pizza was being brought out on a dine in plate and I was sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  This employee has zero self awareness and ability to process information.  

Based on the above stated facts, it is hard to argue that this location has very poor customer service. The employee in question is Keya. He is either mentally challenged, undertrained or simply has zero work ethic. If he doesn't want to work, then don't get a job, proceed to play video games at home and rely on mom and dad.  Either way, this Pizza Hut location a substandard choice for a pizza outing because of him and I would not recommend this location to anyone.

Review: Worst experience. Very rude and unprofessional staff. Make mistakes in orders and give attitude of call to complaint. They make pizza with large side crust to save on cheese and pizza sauce and of course toppings. Don't go there.

Review: I wish I could give no star. Had multiple bad experience with this location and now finally pushed me to write review. So, to start with if you go online it says store is closed and takes me to pre order. I had to call store to put order the guy I talked to said online is closed because we don't have internet, fair enough reason? I placed my order and total comes out subtotal 6.50 so they denied delivery, this review is for Pizza Hut itself now. Minimum delivery? So I asked what is minimum and he said $10. I checked online if he was right and site said $7.99. So liers and unprofessional full of employees at this location. Definitely not ordering ever. Manager Andy seem to have no concern whatsoever.

Review: This used to be our favorite carry out place but for the last couple of months the service has turned horrible.They never put the toppings correctly,pizza is thin for a pan crust & the breadsticks were so hard that we had to throw them away.Waste of money & waste of time.Will never order at this location again.

Review: Pizza was great but there's a blonde employee who's always on her phone and isn't professional . Heaven help you if you need a drink if you dine in. .. or phone in an order.  We dined in and it appears only 25% of phone calls were answered. Plus we never got a refill

Review: Had dinner here with my family. Our server was very good, and she always had a friendly smile. Our 2 medium pizzas (both half-n-half, one with no sauce) came out quickly and were cooked right.  Great pizza. The server had our cinnamon sticks out just at the right time. The only negatives were some crumbs on a couple tables, and the small restrooms are pretty dated .. could use a restroom make-over.

Review: Absolute worst pizza I have ever had.  I should have saved my money and made a frozen totinos pizza.  Pizza was cold upon delivery and all shook up inside the box.  Pan crust was thinner than the thin crust . . . Ended up throwing it away.  Will never order from here again. Only picked 1 star because it made me . . . .

Review: Nothing irritates me more than wasting my time. I ordered online to pickup two pizzas, cheese sticks and a 2 liter. I go to pick it up at the designated time (45 minutes after I placed the order) and their credit card system is down and they tell me to go next door to get cash. 45 minutes had lapsed since I had placed my online order which required me to include both my phone number and email address. You couldn't contact me and tell me that before I got there? I had hungry kids in the car and a sick hubby at home and had to go find an atm machine while my order sat there getting cold. Very disappointed and not the way to treat your customers! I relayed my frustration to the employee who had no interest in rectifying the situation. I understand things happen, but how difficult is it to communicate issues to your customers? Time to find a new Pizza Hut.

Review: Ordered a supreme pizza on thin and crispy crust with an order of the cinnamon sticks. The pizza was cold and soggy. Terrible. The cinnamon sticks were good. Never will order from them again. I am down the street and took 50 minutes to get the stuff. Driver said they were slow, so they were not busy.

Review: Zero stars! Just ordered from this location and they delivered sloppy COLD pizza with barely any cheese. This location is sloppy and has very bad customer service. Will be contacting corporate. You can't run a store to serve clean warm food then stay out of business instead of wasting people's time and money! Don't ever order from this store. Oh and they never answer the phone.

Review: Had the worst experience ever with this store. The canceled my order arbitrarily 5m after I placed it because it was 30m before store close. They never informed me, and when I called to find out why the order was late, they said they did not have it in their system and there was nothing they could do. I told them I had even been charged for it and the attendant told me to stop by tomorrow to get reimbursed. I called my credit card and found out THEY had done a reverse charge on my card, which proves they did cancel the order on purpose. I am pregnant, we literally just moved and had no food in the house. Never recommend this store to anyone.

Review: Can I give them a -5 stars?  This is the 3rd, count them, not the 1st, not the 2nd, THE THIRD time I have ordered a delivery from this store.  EACH TIME, they have been a minimum of 20 minutes late, past the time I requested the order to be delivered.  I'm not ordering during their rush hour - I have placed the order hours, if not days, prior to when I need it.  This last time, I called the store at 10:25am (before they "opened for business").  No one answered the phone until 10:35am.  I was very specific in stating that I needed it here by 11:30am AT THE LATEST.  At 11:40am, I was calling the store.  Got sent to some operator who then switched me over to the store.  Some girl/lady started arguing with me on the phone about the order!  Then she put me on "hold" which was basically disconnecting the call (i.e. HUNG UP ON ME).  I called back - went somewhere with a recording of "we are having technical difficulties"!  WTH?  I called back again, and again.  Told the lady that the order was for 11:30 and now it was 11:50.  Her response?  Click.  What time did the delivery guy walk in?  12:05PM!!!  This wasn't a big order - 3 pizzas and breadsticks.  Didn't even bother them for drinks!  He was so casual, I swear he could have been high.  When I told him he was late, he was like "well, I'm new."  (Sorry dude, you were "new" last month.)  When I asked for the managers' name, he responded with "why?" - "Why? Because you're over a 1/2 hour late!  That's why! Tell your manager that I'm calling your corporate offices because OBVIOUSLY she can't run a store!"  When I asked if I had to sign something (the receipt) he's like "yeah."  "Do you have a pen?"  "Nah, someone stole it from me. Do you have one?"  

FYI - My uncle owns a whole group of Pizza Huts (not in this area) - if this would have been one of his stores, well - first of all, he wouldn't hire idiots like these, secondly, if by accident a few slipped in - they would have been fired for this behavior.  You're losing business and money, Pizza Hut on Ohio Dr.  I feel like Taylor Swift because we ARE NEVER, EVER, EVER ordering from you again!

Review: After waiting 10 minutes to place an order (being the only two people in the place) we were finally asked if we needed to order. In that ten minute span at least 9 employees walked by seeing someone at the front desk two of them actually said something to us along the lines of "oh there are people here" and "I don't know where anything is they lost the key". 3 employees were screaming at each other just on the other side of the swinging door, another arguing with his mom on the phone at the front counter but wouldn't help us because he "works in the back" and clearly was preoccupied. I'm not sure what kind of work was going on there all I know is if my pizza wasn't free I wouldn't have given them my business and will not going forward. So if your looking for a minimum wage paying job where you get paid to just do your own thing and maybe participate in running a pizza through the oven every so often; I highly recommend this place. But from a customer service point of view, how this place is still open is beyond me. They have some serious employee revisions to make.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I honestly would rather have consistently decent food and pizza hut provides that experience for me. I can always depend on a decent meal in 2024 and thats all I ask for! Thank you. 

You are better than all of these inconsistent places. Its been getting ridiculous in the fast food world.

Review: It's Pizza Hut. I order last minute for delivery or pickup and the pizza is ready in 20-30 min. Can't tell you what the ambiance is because I never go in. Either it shows up at my door or I pull up and they put it in my car. Pizza always tastes like Pizza Hut and the original crust is always buttery. Why 5 star? Because I don't go order Pizza Hut delivery expecting it to be some gourmet pizza. It shows up for parties and football games to go with copious amounts of beer.

Review: What a pleasant surprise... Pizza Hut is back in the game. I have not ordered in a while but decided to give another try after over a year and boy I am glad I did. That was the most delicious pizza I have had in a very long time. It was so hot it burned the roof of my mouth a bit... lol
Thank you for stepping up your game and making an excellent pizza and it was also delivered on time. Great Job everyone!!!

Review: Only giving 2 stars for prompt delivery & taste. Ordered a make your own supreme/meat pizza and it was delicious.

Unfortunately, there was a rock-like substance that was easily mistaken for a piece of black olive, which almost broke my tooth.

Not the best for a $33 pizza.

Review: Deserves no star rating. ordered online with curbside pickup. Waited at curb for 20 minutes after order due time. Not a clue about customer service here. Ordered wings & pizza. Wings were tough and stale. Like made a week ago and stuck on the back counter for some sucker to order. Pizza was absolutely FOUL. stale with disgusting cardboard tasting thin crust. Half of pizza had pepperoni - they put all of 4 slices on it. 
I have been buying pizza for decades in NY, Chicago & everywhere in between, I will never ever buy anything from Pizza Butt again. Take my advice - buy store bought and make it yourself. Pizza Butt needs to be driven out of business.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: Cardboard with tomato sauce and garlic would of tasted better. I remember when pizza hut was good. Sorry cannot do this anymore. A frozen pizza from Wal Mart is much better. Dont waste your money. Ever since the chinese have bought KFC,Taco Bell and Pizza Hut the food is not worth eating.

Review: Online says they're open but when I pulled up there's a handwritten sign that says "sorry we're closed." 

When I looked to the right (door where they take that trash out, exit for delivery, etc) there's a few employees sitting there smoking  cigs.  

My initial frustrated thoughts were why are they closed but when I saw the employees (looking careless and washed up) casually puffing on their cigs I thought... this must be a sign from God. 

I think that'll be my last visit to there.  I'm an 80's baby and I remember when Pizza Hut used to dominate the industry... times have surely changed that.

Review: I'm giving a very deep sigh right now. I wanted pizza and I thought about Pizza Hut. Well I usually don't even bother with this location. I either go to the food stand in Target, or drive 10 minutes to the one on Dallas Parkway in Frisco. Well it's been a long day and I didn't feel like driving, and the stand at Target was probably closing soon. Soooo, I had an ounce of hope that the Ohio Drive location got better. W-R-O-N-G..... I'm also babysitting and even the kids were turned off. I don't know if they were running out of cheese, but they could've thrown another fistful on there. The piled plenty of Hut Flavor seasoning on the crust. It's greasy and goopy. The sauce tastes watered down.. I should've just went to Target. They have 9 inch personal pans now! I'm officially done with this location.

Review: The pizza was ready in 15 minutes, so that should've been enough of a warning.  The first bite immediately felt stale, and the crust was doughy and the cheese was congealed.  All in all it tasted like moldy bread.

Review: ZERO STARS!!! Tonight I ordered online for my pizza and two Hersheys's chocolate chip cookie for delivery at 9pm. I put directions down how to get into my neighborhood and left my house phone number. Waited for the delivery pizza guy to come. Noticing the pizza hut delivery was talking a bit to long. I called the pizza hut place at 10:30pm to see my order is on its way. The person on the phone said it will be there soon. I waited a half an hour at 11:30pm.  

At this point I'm getting fed up waiting for my order that I ordered. I called the Pizza Hut place again. I give them my online order number and my address. The guy on the phone tells me the pizza hut delivery guy called my house phone and got no response and they told me I put down the wrong phone number I gave them. No I didn't put the wrong house number down because I always check for that stuff when I'm ordering online for food. Plus if you call only one time and get no response. Shouldn't you call that phone number again just to make sure? Then just assuming you called the wrong phone number?

Plus the guy on the phone told me they don't deliver into my area because it's to far away from the driver and they might of changed the delivery route!  
ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!  You pizza hut guys are located only 10 minutes from my neighborhood and you tell me you can't deliver the food that I ordered?! Because its to far away from pizza delivery guy liking?!

The guy on the phone asked have they delivered to my address before?
I told the guy on the phone yes you have many times!

Then guy on the phone then said since they got no response from the phone number I gave them and the area to my neighborhood was to far away... The delivery guy had to return the order that I was waiting for back to the pizza hut place and had to let the delivery guy go for night. They guy said sorry and then hanged up the phone.

IDIOTS!! THANK YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME AND PATIENTCE FOR YOUR PATHETIC EXCUSES!! IT'S A BUNCH OF BULLS#&T!

Review: Cold, delivery late, dry.  Snotty person hung up on me when I was persistent about talking to the manager.  I'm not exaggerating when I say it was the worst pizza I've ever ordered.

Review: Very good service by Gina. Very good pizza. Speciality is that they have hand towel tools on each table so don't have to request for more napkins. Will visit often, for sure.

Review: After waiting 10 minutes to place an order (being the only two people in the place) we were finally asked if we needed to order. In that ten minute span at least 9 employees walked by seeing someone at the front desk two of them actually said something to us along the lines of "oh there are people here" and "I don't know where anything is they lost the key". 3 employees were screaming at each other just on the other side of the swinging door, another arguing with his mom on the phone at the front counter but wouldn't help us because he "works in the back" and clearly was preoccupied. I'm not sure what kind of work was going on there all I know is if my pizza wasn't free I wouldn't have given them my business and will not going forward. So if your looking for a minimum wage paying job where you get paid to just do your own thing and maybe participate in running a pizza through the oven every so often; I highly recommend this place. But from a customer service point of view, how this place is still open is beyond me. They have some serious employee revisions to make.

Review: I honestly would rather have consistently decent food and pizza hut provides that experience for me. I can always depend on a decent meal in 2024 and thats all I ask for! Thank you. 

You are better than all of these inconsistent places. Its been getting ridiculous in the fast food world.

Review: Unmitigated disaster in terms of how long the food took.  Didn't seem that busy but waited in drive thru for a personal pan pizza and wings for 20 minutes.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I give this 5 stars due to the fact that they are quick with orders and delivering on a timely manner. Even when they made a mistake they fix the issue with solutions and not leave you disappointed. I personally have had a great experience at this Pizza Hut

Rating: 5 stars
Review: It's Pizza Hut. I order last minute for delivery or pickup and the pizza is ready in 20-30 min. Can't tell you what the ambiance is because I never go in. Either it shows up at my door or I pull up and they put it in my car. Pizza always tastes like Pizza Hut and the original crust is always buttery. Why 5 star? Because I don't go order Pizza Hut delivery expecting it to be some gourmet pizza. It shows up for parties and football games to go with copious amounts of beer.

Review: What a pleasant surprise... Pizza Hut is back in the game. I have not ordered in a while but decided to give another try after over a year and boy I am glad I did. That was the most delicious pizza I have had in a very long time. It was so hot it burned the roof of my mouth a bit... lol
Thank you for stepping up your game and making an excellent pizza and it was also delivered on time. Great Job everyone!!!

Review: Only giving 2 stars for prompt delivery & taste. Ordered a make your own supreme/meat pizza and it was delicious.

Unfortunately, there was a rock-like substance that was easily mistaken for a piece of black olive, which almost broke my tooth.

Not the best for a $33 pizza.

Review: Deserves no star rating. ordered online with curbside pickup. Waited at curb for 20 minutes after order due time. Not a clue about customer service here. Ordered wings & pizza. Wings were tough and stale. Like made a week ago and stuck on the back counter for some sucker to order. Pizza was absolutely FOUL. stale with disgusting cardboard tasting thin crust. Half of pizza had pepperoni - they put all of 4 slices on it. 
I have been buying pizza for decades in NY, Chicago & everywhere in between, I will never ever buy anything from Pizza Butt again. Take my advice - buy store bought and make it yourself. Pizza Butt needs to be driven out of business.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: Cardboard with tomato sauce and garlic would of tasted better. I remember when pizza hut was good. Sorry cannot do this anymore. A frozen pizza from Wal Mart is much better. Dont waste your money. Ever since the chinese have bought KFC,Taco Bell and Pizza Hut the food is not worth eating.

Review: I would leave 0 stars if it was possible. I waited inside the store for 1 hour and asked where my order was 3 times. Every other customer received their pizza with no issues. I will not return to this location until management responds to this review

Review: Online says they're open but when I pulled up there's a handwritten sign that says "sorry we're closed." 

When I looked to the right (door where they take that trash out, exit for delivery, etc) there's a few employees sitting there smoking  cigs.  

My initial frustrated thoughts were why are they closed but when I saw the employees (looking careless and washed up) casually puffing on their cigs I thought... this must be a sign from God. 

I think that'll be my last visit to there.  I'm an 80's baby and I remember when Pizza Hut used to dominate the industry... times have surely changed that.

Review: I'm giving a very deep sigh right now. I wanted pizza and I thought about Pizza Hut. Well I usually don't even bother with this location. I either go to the food stand in Target, or drive 10 minutes to the one on Dallas Parkway in Frisco. Well it's been a long day and I didn't feel like driving, and the stand at Target was probably closing soon. Soooo, I had an ounce of hope that the Ohio Drive location got better. W-R-O-N-G..... I'm also babysitting and even the kids were turned off. I don't know if they were running out of cheese, but they could've thrown another fistful on there. The piled plenty of Hut Flavor seasoning on the crust. It's greasy and goopy. The sauce tastes watered down.. I should've just went to Target. They have 9 inch personal pans now! I'm officially done with this location.

Review: The pizza was ready in 15 minutes, so that should've been enough of a warning.  The first bite immediately felt stale, and the crust was doughy and the cheese was congealed.  All in all it tasted like moldy bread.

Review: ZERO STARS!!! Tonight I ordered online for my pizza and two Hersheys's chocolate chip cookie for delivery at 9pm. I put directions down how to get into my neighborhood and left my house phone number. Waited for the delivery pizza guy to come. Noticing the pizza hut delivery was talking a bit to long. I called the pizza hut place at 10:30pm to see my order is on its way. The person on the phone said it will be there soon. I waited a half an hour at 11:30pm.  

At this point I'm getting fed up waiting for my order that I ordered. I called the Pizza Hut place again. I give them my online order number and my address. The guy on the phone tells me the pizza hut delivery guy called my house phone and got no response and they told me I put down the wrong phone number I gave them. No I didn't put the wrong house number down because I always check for that stuff when I'm ordering online for food. Plus if you call only one time and get no response. Shouldn't you call that phone number again just to make sure? Then just assuming you called the wrong phone number?

Plus the guy on the phone told me they don't deliver into my area because it's to far away from the driver and they might of changed the delivery route!  
ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!  You pizza hut guys are located only 10 minutes from my neighborhood and you tell me you can't deliver the food that I ordered?! Because its to far away from pizza delivery guy liking?!

The guy on the phone asked have they delivered to my address before?
I told the guy on the phone yes you have many times!

Then guy on the phone then said since they got no response from the phone number I gave them and the area to my neighborhood was to far away... The delivery guy had to return the order that I was waiting for back to the pizza hut place and had to let the delivery guy go for night. They guy said sorry and then hanged up the phone.

IDIOTS!! THANK YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME AND PATIENTCE FOR YOUR PATHETIC EXCUSES!! IT'S A BUNCH OF BULLS#&T!

Review: This location has always come through pretty clutch for me. They are prompt with the deliveries and one driver a middle aged white male always calls as he is arriving which is outstanding customer service. I love the cinnabon minis, like too much haha. Also, PZones are under rated!

Review: Needs zero stars given the total lack of customer service.  We ordered delivery last night.  They never delivered.  Multiple calls to ask why no delivery.  Always put on hold and then hung up on.  
Same occurred the next day.

Review: Tonight they totally messed up my order. Received the wrong pizza and wrong wings and no condiments.

I called three times to ask them to correct it.

Manager said "that's not going to happen" and hung up.

Do not order there.

I will be doing a charge back on my credit card.

Review: Our work group came today. We ordered pizza, wings, and bread sticks. Everything was perfectly cooked and the service was spot on. The supreme pizza has a few less toppings than I expected, and the veggie just did not have a great flavor, and I always like veggie. They also serve pepsi instead of Coke, bummer. It is dark and outdated inside, needs a big update.

Review: Ordered pizza, 50 min wait. One pizza completely wrong, the other had random mushrooms on it incorrectly. Had to wait another 30 min for the right pizza to be delivered and not a great customer service experience when I explained the error.

Review: Tonight I went to eat at this Pizza Hut location. Upon walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant. I asked for a menu review. Afterward, I stood at the counter to provide my order as a man was being helped in front of me. Shortly, another gentleman walk into the store and stood in line. After the man in front of me walks away, the employee skips me and proceeds to assist the gentleman who walked in after I was already in line.  While that was already annoying, I never interrupted and waited.  After that gentleman walks away, the employee fumbles with a few pens and a receipt and never makes eye contact with me, even though I was less than 3 feet away from him. After waiting for around 30-45 seconds for the employee to make eye contact, he asked "what is your name" and what he could do for me. I told him that he skipped me to help a man who was behind me in line and the response was, "uh, ok."  Then I proceeded to be annoyed and expressed that he ignored me even after the last gentleman was helped walked away. Again, he responded with "uh, ok." That is when I got upset and responded with "no, that's not ok," followed by a firm stare.

In addition, this employee failed to ask me if it is dine in or take out.  As a result, I was given the pizza in a box, even though I was dining in. The pizza was brought out by another employee in a dine on a dine in plate, the main employee at issue brought our my wings in a bag and to go box.  Why would he do that AFTER seeing that my pizza was being brought out on a dine in plate and I was sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  This employee has zero self awareness and ability to process information.  

Based on the above stated facts, it is hard to argue that this location has very poor customer service. The employee in question is Keya. He is either mentally challenged, undertrained or simply has zero work ethic. If he doesn't want to work, then don't get a job, proceed to play video games at home and rely on mom and dad.  Either way, this Pizza Hut location a substandard choice for a pizza outing because of him and I would not recommend this location to anyone.

Review: Worst experience. Very rude and unprofessional staff. Make mistakes in orders and give attitude of call to complaint. They make pizza with large side crust to save on cheese and pizza sauce and of course toppings. Don't go there.

Review: I wish I could give no star. Had multiple bad experience with this location and now finally pushed me to write review. So, to start with if you go online it says store is closed and takes me to pre order. I had to call store to put order the guy I talked to said online is closed because we don't have internet, fair enough reason? I placed my order and total comes out subtotal 6.50 so they denied delivery, this review is for Pizza Hut itself now. Minimum delivery? So I asked what is minimum and he said $10. I checked online if he was right and site said $7.99. So liers and unprofessional full of employees at this location. Definitely not ordering ever. Manager Andy seem to have no concern whatsoever.

Review: This used to be our favorite carry out place but for the last couple of months the service has turned horrible.They never put the toppings correctly,pizza is thin for a pan crust & the breadsticks were so hard that we had to throw them away.Waste of money & waste of time.Will never order at this location again.

Review: Pizza was great but there's a blonde employee who's always on her phone and isn't professional . Heaven help you if you need a drink if you dine in. .. or phone in an order.  We dined in and it appears only 25% of phone calls were answered. Plus we never got a refill

Review: Had dinner here with my family. Our server was very good, and she always had a friendly smile. Our 2 medium pizzas (both half-n-half, one with no sauce) came out quickly and were cooked right.  Great pizza. The server had our cinnamon sticks out just at the right time. The only negatives were some crumbs on a couple tables, and the small restrooms are pretty dated .. could use a restroom make-over.

Review: Absolute worst pizza I have ever had.  I should have saved my money and made a frozen totinos pizza.  Pizza was cold upon delivery and all shook up inside the box.  Pan crust was thinner than the thin crust . . . Ended up throwing it away.  Will never order from here again. Only picked 1 star because it made me . . . .

Review: Nothing irritates me more than wasting my time. I ordered online to pickup two pizzas, cheese sticks and a 2 liter. I go to pick it up at the designated time (45 minutes after I placed the order) and their credit card system is down and they tell me to go next door to get cash. 45 minutes had lapsed since I had placed my online order which required me to include both my phone number and email address. You couldn't contact me and tell me that before I got there? I had hungry kids in the car and a sick hubby at home and had to go find an atm machine while my order sat there getting cold. Very disappointed and not the way to treat your customers! I relayed my frustration to the employee who had no interest in rectifying the situation. I understand things happen, but how difficult is it to communicate issues to your customers? Time to find a new Pizza Hut.

Review: Ordered a supreme pizza on thin and crispy crust with an order of the cinnamon sticks. The pizza was cold and soggy. Terrible. The cinnamon sticks were good. Never will order from them again. I am down the street and took 50 minutes to get the stuff. Driver said they were slow, so they were not busy.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: Zero stars! Just ordered from this location and they delivered sloppy COLD pizza with barely any cheese. This location is sloppy and has very bad customer service. Will be contacting corporate. You can't run a store to serve clean warm food then stay out of business instead of wasting people's time and money! Don't ever order from this store. Oh and they never answer the phone.

Review: Had the worst experience ever with this store. The canceled my order arbitrarily 5m after I placed it because it was 30m before store close. They never informed me, and when I called to find out why the order was late, they said they did not have it in their system and there was nothing they could do. I told them I had even been charged for it and the attendant told me to stop by tomorrow to get reimbursed. I called my credit card and found out THEY had done a reverse charge on my card, which proves they did cancel the order on purpose. I am pregnant, we literally just moved and had no food in the house. Never recommend this store to anyone.

Review: Can I give them a -5 stars?  This is the 3rd, count them, not the 1st, not the 2nd, THE THIRD time I have ordered a delivery from this store.  EACH TIME, they have been a minimum of 20 minutes late, past the time I requested the order to be delivered.  I'm not ordering during their rush hour - I have placed the order hours, if not days, prior to when I need it.  This last time, I called the store at 10:25am (before they "opened for business").  No one answered the phone until 10:35am.  I was very specific in stating that I needed it here by 11:30am AT THE LATEST.  At 11:40am, I was calling the store.  Got sent to some operator who then switched me over to the store.  Some girl/lady started arguing with me on the phone about the order!  Then she put me on "hold" which was basically disconnecting the call (i.e. HUNG UP ON ME).  I called back - went somewhere with a recording of "we are having technical difficulties"!  WTH?  I called back again, and again.  Told the lady that the order was for 11:30 and now it was 11:50.  Her response?  Click.  What time did the delivery guy walk in?  12:05PM!!!  This wasn't a big order - 3 pizzas and breadsticks.  Didn't even bother them for drinks!  He was so casual, I swear he could have been high.  When I told him he was late, he was like "well, I'm new."  (Sorry dude, you were "new" last month.)  When I asked for the managers' name, he responded with "why?" - "Why? Because you're over a 1/2 hour late!  That's why! Tell your manager that I'm calling your corporate offices because OBVIOUSLY she can't run a store!"  When I asked if I had to sign something (the receipt) he's like "yeah."  "Do you have a pen?"  "Nah, someone stole it from me. Do you have one?"  

FYI - My uncle owns a whole group of Pizza Huts (not in this area) - if this would have been one of his stores, well - first of all, he wouldn't hire idiots like these, secondly, if by accident a few slipped in - they would have been fired for this behavior.  You're losing business and money, Pizza Hut on Ohio Dr.  I feel like Taylor Swift because we ARE NEVER, EVER, EVER ordering from you again!
