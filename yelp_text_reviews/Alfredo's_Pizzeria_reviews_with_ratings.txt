Review: Run to Ferrari's if you are looking for some awesome NY style pizza. There are many spots around DFW that claim to have NY style pizza, but they are not it. This place does it right and it's probably because the owner and his family are all from NY. I'm a purist, so I always go for a regular/plain cheese slice and this place does not disappoint. I even took a whole pie home so I have lunch for the week!

My wife is a bit more adventurous and tries different things off the menu, which always is on point as well. This time she tried their chicken cutlet hero and she loved it!

We will frequent this place for as long as we live in this metroplex!

Review: Excellent pizza and friendly service! I loved the grandma pie and their white pie was one of my favs. I also had the garlic knots and the marinara that came with them was very good. I'd probably try their pasta if I were to go again!

Review: Pizza and calzones have always been on point. They have some good speciality pizzas like the Buffalo Chicken pizza. 

The calzone was ~$11 with pepperoni. 

Some of the speciality pizzas can get a little pricey 

Staff was friendly and had plenty of space to sit down and eat while I assume it has a lot of takeout business.

Review: Closest thing to the NY style slice I've had here in Dallas. Love their grandma slice, chicken parm slice (specialty pie that comes out on Fridays) 

It's nestled in an ordinary little strip mall and easy to miss - seems like a neighborhood joint with lots of regulars. They have great pizza but if you go later like 7pm, you'll have limited choices and they dont seem to make fresh pies closer to closing which I understand. Do get their tiramisu, an absolute must!

Cashier service has always been courteous but never that friendly. Not a deal breaker for me but to some maybe.

Review: Ferrari's Pizza has some of the best pizza. However, I have to give them 3 stars because their other food options were disappointing. The mozzarella sticks tasted like something you'd grab from a freezer aisle, and the calamari was a major letdown more batter than calamari, and we ended up throwing it out.
That said, we'll definitely continue visiting but will stick strictly to the pizza.If you're a pizza lover, this place is a must try. For anything else, I'd recommend passing.

Review: Really pleased with this place. Service was friendly and the pizza was yummy. It's thin crust, large in size, and did not give me acid reflux. Always a win! The garlic knots and pizza rolls are ok. I'd just stick to the pizza next time. 

Still looking for the extra special pizza so that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I'll know when I taste it. Other than that, the pizza is good and is worth a try.

Review: Wow! Finally a great NY style pizza right here in Plano. After searching for this type of pizzeria for 2 years, we finally found Ferrari's Pizza, and it did not disappoint. They have a fantastic selection of pizzas, and the sizes are generous.

We ordered an 18" pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeno, and it was devoured by our family of four. The kids loved it, and the quality of the pizza was outstanding.

The service was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable for what you get. They also offer a good selection of alcohol, which is a nice bonus. We even met Vinny, the owner, who is a great guy from New York, adding an authentic touch to the whole experience.

We will definitely be back and highly recommend Ferrari's Pizza to anyone looking for an authentic NY pizza experience in Plano.

Review: Came over on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Not too busy and staff was friendly. Very good pizza, what I think of when I want New York style pizza. Thin, crisp crust with a tangy sauce and lots of cheese. Got a slice of cheese and the Grandma slice. Both were exceptional.

Can't wait to come back and try other menu items. Well done!

Review: When you hear Ferrari.... You think high end, world class, luxurious.
But for me it's just big pizza....
Nothing fancy, just big... pretty mediocre.
Service was pretty mediocre, though I will say I was only there to pick up my pizza.
I do plan to go back and dine in.
The place looks nice but just your standard small pizza place. 

Over all it's pretty forgettable 
I'd give it another try...
But I'm in no rush

Review: I ordered a pie for pick up... I was told this place was very "New York" but I had my doubts as "real" NYC pizza is hard to find in the DFW area.

Fuggetabout stars, I give this place 5 out of 5 marons!

Review: I kept hearing such great things about this place figured I'd give them a try. Well I guess I caught them on a bad day there was only one girl working. Not sure if she is the usual pizza maker or not but she was doing it all herself. With that being said it definitely match the expectations. It wasn't bad but for $44 dollars I would have expected better from 2 14in pizzas.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: It was mediocre at best.  I placed my order online and arrived a few minutes prior to the expected ready time.    The counter guy was on the phone and took several minutes to take an order, then answered another call before getting to me.   That was several minutes.   My pizza was ready.  The pizza itself was warm, but not hot.   It had very little cheese or toppings.   For a $30.00 pizza it was very dissappointing.  Literally any of the chains would have been better at half the cost.  Go somewhere else.

Review: This is in a two way tie for my favorite pizza in the metroplex and I'm blessed that it is not far away. They get about as close as you can get to NYC pizza without having to catch a train and fight a few giant rats along the way. One taste and if you know, you know, you know?? 

Sometimes I can't talk the family into a whole pizza, which never lasts long anyway, and I'll stop by for a slice. My kids don't eat the crust, they didn't get that from my side. More for me. The crust has the chew you want. The sauce and cheese ratio, they nailed it. It tastes like they even have NYC tap water in the dough. Bolognese is fantastic. House sausage if you want a good slice, that's all you need. What more do I gotta say? It's a perfect slice.

Review: The ONLY actual NY-style pizza place nearby. Since moving from NY in 2021, I had given up on finding good pizza here. Luckily, Ferrari's was 5 min from one of my errands so I decided to stop by - so glad I did! I got a plain slice (I cried happy tears as I folded the slice, New Yorker style) and a delicious grandma slice (I've never even heard that word here).

Wish it was closer to my house!

Review: I wouldn't have written a review about the stale dry pizza and bread, empty ice machine, broken bathroom latch or disjointed service where my wife didn't get her sandwich until the other 7 in our party of 8 were finished eating.  But when the owner loudly says to my wife "Way to make a scene" for simply asking about her sandwich after everyone else in our party is finished eating, I feel like I should let others know.  When I ask him why he is making a scene when all she did was ask for her meal and he tells me this is a counter service place, as if that means they don't have to care about service or their customer, I need to write a review.  (Others in our party had orders that were cooked and not simply reheated and their food was also served and eaten before my wife's ever came out.)  I asked him not to talk to my wife that way and he asked me "what are you gonna do?"   So if I can't beat up the owner then he can talk to my wife (and you) however he wants.  Yes, when that happens I need to let others know.  When he then announces to the restaurant my wife is high maintenance I need to write a review.  One look at this "restaurant" will tell you the owner is no authority on "maintenance."

Don't waste your time or money on this "restaurant" or its angry owner.  Maintenance is low, food quality lower and the service and pride in ownership is embarrassing and downright shameful.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Staff is great, friendly, courteous, and helpful. Ambience is nice. Food is good, not great for the price.

Last time we got a whole Sicilian pie, we had a reheat it and cook it for quite a while before it was actually "done", and not a bunch of uncooked dough. And for the amount we paid for it, the topping seemed really sparse.

Review: Been coming here for years! Actually we order it once a week. Hands down the best pizza in DFW. Full stop. And believe me we've tried a lot of pizza since we've moved here from Miami! It's a perfect New York style pizza with a thick crust on the end and then thin the rest of the way just as it should be. Absolute perfection! 

Just go, it's great pizza! :)

Review: 1 star is waaaaaaay too high for this place.  Last time I checked customer service is a thing.  From the moment we walked in the guy at the register was rude.  We didn't get menus, were not even greeted, and had no idea if we were to order at the register or if they came to the table.  When I asked this guy...he seemed put out and had an attitude.  I thought it was just me but the customer behind me asked if he was being snarky to me.  This was our first time AND LAST time we will eat here.
None of the food came out together which I understand.  Most of us were finished eating when the last meal came out.  When we inquired about it this guy started accusing us of "making a scene" and being "high maintenance".  He also said since they are counter service they don't have to worry about customer service.  

The food was barely Meh and then the service...save yourself don't eat here!

Review: I went on a Saturday and was not disappointed. The restaurant is clean, nice radio station. We were greeted by a friendly counter person, and the available pies, which looked amazing. The house pie is front and center cheese and sauce. Add topping to your slice, and they bring it out to your table. We went with sauce and cheese, and it was terrific. The crust is worth up to a 50-mile travel. So, let's say it's a 50-mile crust--crisp, flavorful, and perfect color.

Review: Food- Had their house size pizza which is amazing! Reminded my wife of the pizza she used to eat back in the east coast. Massive pie, delicious sauce, just enough cheese, and a really thin crust. 

Service - I picked up the pizza but the staff was so kind! Had two kids with me and one of those is a baby who needed to be held. The team on site recognized my struggle and insisted on taking the pie to my car while I held the baby and my other child. Such a nice gesture which you don't often see these days. Thank you!

Very happy about the food and the service. We'll definitely be back!

Review: Quiet, kinda small place but I always get pizza for takeout so it's fine. Pizza here is amazing, you can tell that it's homemade as they take 10-20 mins to make each pizza. I always order the Mediterranean Pie (pesto and alfredo sauce, sundried tomatoes, feta and mozzarella) and it's so delicious. I've also order the Alfredo which was also pretty good.

Review: This Pizza place when I went in was an owner operated restaurant. Love was put into their food. For a Texas pizza place it was a hit and good quality. New York style pizza. I had better in New York but if you live here you want to go. The meatballs and sauce impressed me and were very good and I would highly recommend them. The ambience and seating was a closet small feeling. Service was fine. More or less I would return.

Review: Found this Italian owned pizzeria by accident tonight while heading back to Northern Collin County. The place was clean, had great service, and I will return when I am in the area. 

We ordered the largest meat pizza they had for a party of 5 including two hungry teenage boys after their football game. They devoured the pie. 

The toppings were flavorful. The sauce was delicious. The crust was thin and perfect. 

Unfortunately the pie was finished before we could even get a picture, but the pics others have posted are accurate. 

I recommend their thin crust pizza over any others in the area. Go try them out! You won't regret it. 

Ciao.

Review: It says pizza right in the name so maybe I should have gotten the pizza. But I wanted pasta and they had it so I ordered it. And it was not great.

I ordered the carbonara which came with a white sauce. I would guess it's Alfredo sauce but guessing is all you can do because the flavor was absent. It was a bit soupy and was so nothing that I added ketchup when I got home and I'm not even kidding. If this is typical of the pasta sauce I would say maybe they should take it off the menu.

That said, the peas and prosciutto were flavorful and perfect. So it's an easy enough thing to fix if they are motivated to do so. [Edit: They do not seem motivated to do so.] I will skip revisit since the owner said on Yelp that I'm not welcomed due to my opinion of the pasta sauce. Thankfully there are other shops in town with both better food and more pleasant owners.

Review: I'm a New Yorker born and raised 40 years before moving down to Texas and when I tell you this Owner is truly a native New Yorker with New York style pizza from the aroma, to the perfection on the crust...  drove from Dallas and worth the drive and won't be the last trip. Service is on point and the place is clean to perfection.

Review: We've been searching several years for good New York style pizza. This place had been recommended several times in a Facebook foodie group.  We're glad we finally had a chance to stop in. The pizza was delicious. We'll definitely be back to try more pies!

Review: I'm going to try to keep this this brief. We ordered from them Friday night. Our order of ten wings came with eight. The pizza, was a "baked ziti pie" which sounded awesome because we love spaghetti pizza. With ordered a few extra toppings, and it actually looked "okay" when we got home. But here's the thing - the pasta was over-cooked, the pink sauce it was in was broken & grainy, and the remainder of the toppings had little to no flavor. The crust was not cut through and so tough that it was nearly inedible. 

I'd let this all go if the business had not decided to start volleying personal attacks suggesting we get COVID tests and totaling avoiding the fact they shorted our order. The restaurant uses a generic purveyor of frozen pizza ingredients, from dough to toppings (Lisanti - who basically distributes a turnkey, mass-produced, frozen, bland product). Their dough shows no evidence of being house-made. What they do show is a dogged approach to attacking anyone who does not like their products.

There are plenty of other options locally working from scratch. Campisi's & Zalat come to mind.

Review: When moving into a new area, finding a good New York pizza is as important to me as finding a good barber.  Having lived over 20 years in New York City and having eaten good NY pizza, I was thrilled to find great NY pizza in the area.  

The three of us ordered a 22-inch plain cheese pie and a cannoli to share. The cannoli was freshly filled so it retained the crispy shell.  The cream filling was not overly sweet and its overall consistency was very good. 

My wife and I agreed the pizza itself was the best NY pizza we've had since leaving NY about 25 years ago.  The slices were perfectly foldable, nicely crispy on the outside and the right amount of chewy inside.  The crust was not too salty and the sauce to cheese ratio was excellent.  As legitimate NY slices often do, these almost burned the roof of my mouth and a few drops of oil from the cheese fell on the paper plate.  The pie was huge so we took plenty of leftovers home. 

The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was spacious and super clean.  If you're looking for an authentic NY pizza, you won't be disappointed with Ferrari's.  Highly recommend!!

That was the BEST pizza I have ever had in Dallas and I have lived here since 1995.

And the sauce is really flavorful!! Don't miss trying the Portobello pizza!

Review: Been coming here for years! Actually we order it once a week. Hands down the best pizza in DFW. Full stop. And believe me we've tried a lot of pizza since we've moved here from Miami! It's a perfect New York style pizza with a thick crust on the end and then thin the rest of the way just as it should be. Absolute perfection! 

Just go, it's great pizza! :)

Review: 1 star is waaaaaaay too high for this place.  Last time I checked customer service is a thing.  From the moment we walked in the guy at the register was rude.  We didn't get menus, were not even greeted, and had no idea if we were to order at the register or if they came to the table.  When I asked this guy...he seemed put out and had an attitude.  I thought it was just me but the customer behind me asked if he was being snarky to me.  This was our first time AND LAST time we will eat here.
None of the food came out together which I understand.  Most of us were finished eating when the last meal came out.  When we inquired about it this guy started accusing us of "making a scene" and being "high maintenance".  He also said since they are counter service they don't have to worry about customer service.  

The food was barely Meh and then the service...save yourself don't eat here!

Review: I went on a Saturday and was not disappointed. The restaurant is clean, nice radio station. We were greeted by a friendly counter person, and the available pies, which looked amazing. The house pie is front and center cheese and sauce. Add topping to your slice, and they bring it out to your table. We went with sauce and cheese, and it was terrific. The crust is worth up to a 50-mile travel. So, let's say it's a 50-mile crust--crisp, flavorful, and perfect color.

Review: Food- Had their house size pizza which is amazing! Reminded my wife of the pizza she used to eat back in the east coast. Massive pie, delicious sauce, just enough cheese, and a really thin crust. 

Service - I picked up the pizza but the staff was so kind! Had two kids with me and one of those is a baby who needed to be held. The team on site recognized my struggle and insisted on taking the pie to my car while I held the baby and my other child. Such a nice gesture which you don't often see these days. Thank you!

Very happy about the food and the service. We'll definitely be back!

Review: Quiet, kinda small place but I always get pizza for takeout so it's fine. Pizza here is amazing, you can tell that it's homemade as they take 10-20 mins to make each pizza. I always order the Mediterranean Pie (pesto and alfredo sauce, sundried tomatoes, feta and mozzarella) and it's so delicious. I've also order the Alfredo which was also pretty good.

Review: This Pizza place when I went in was an owner operated restaurant. Love was put into their food. For a Texas pizza place it was a hit and good quality. New York style pizza. I had better in New York but if you live here you want to go. The meatballs and sauce impressed me and were very good and I would highly recommend them. The ambience and seating was a closet small feeling. Service was fine. More or less I would return.

Review: Found this Italian owned pizzeria by accident tonight while heading back to Northern Collin County. The place was clean, had great service, and I will return when I am in the area. 

We ordered the largest meat pizza they had for a party of 5 including two hungry teenage boys after their football game. They devoured the pie. 

The toppings were flavorful. The sauce was delicious. The crust was thin and perfect. 

Unfortunately the pie was finished before we could even get a picture, but the pics others have posted are accurate. 

I recommend their thin crust pizza over any others in the area. Go try them out! You won't regret it. 

Ciao.

Review: It says pizza right in the name so maybe I should have gotten the pizza. But I wanted pasta and they had it so I ordered it. And it was not great.

I ordered the carbonara which came with a white sauce. I would guess it's Alfredo sauce but guessing is all you can do because the flavor was absent. It was a bit soupy and was so nothing that I added ketchup when I got home and I'm not even kidding. If this is typical of the pasta sauce I would say maybe they should take it off the menu.

That said, the peas and prosciutto were flavorful and perfect. So it's an easy enough thing to fix if they are motivated to do so. [Edit: They do not seem motivated to do so.] I will skip revisit since the owner said on Yelp that I'm not welcomed due to my opinion of the pasta sauce. Thankfully there are other shops in town with both better food and more pleasant owners.

Review: I'm going to try to keep this this brief. We ordered from them Friday night. Our order of ten wings came with eight. The pizza, was a "baked ziti pie" which sounded awesome because we love spaghetti pizza. With ordered a few extra toppings, and it actually looked "okay" when we got home. But here's the thing - the pasta was over-cooked, the pink sauce it was in was broken & grainy, and the remainder of the toppings had little to no flavor. The crust was not cut through and so tough that it was nearly inedible. 

I'd let this all go if the business had not decided to start volleying personal attacks suggesting we get COVID tests and totaling avoiding the fact they shorted our order. The restaurant uses a generic purveyor of frozen pizza ingredients, from dough to toppings (Lisanti - who basically distributes a turnkey, mass-produced, frozen, bland product). Their dough shows no evidence of being house-made. What they do show is a dogged approach to attacking anyone who does not like their products.

There are plenty of other options locally working from scratch. Campisi's & Zalat come to mind.

Review: When moving into a new area, finding a good New York pizza is as important to me as finding a good barber.  Having lived over 20 years in New York City and having eaten good NY pizza, I was thrilled to find great NY pizza in the area.  

The three of us ordered a 22-inch plain cheese pie and a cannoli to share. The cannoli was freshly filled so it retained the crispy shell.  The cream filling was not overly sweet and its overall consistency was very good. 

My wife and I agreed the pizza itself was the best NY pizza we've had since leaving NY about 25 years ago.  The slices were perfectly foldable, nicely crispy on the outside and the right amount of chewy inside.  The crust was not too salty and the sauce to cheese ratio was excellent.  As legitimate NY slices often do, these almost burned the roof of my mouth and a few drops of oil from the cheese fell on the paper plate.  The pie was huge so we took plenty of leftovers home. 

The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was spacious and super clean.  If you're looking for an authentic NY pizza, you won't be disappointed with Ferrari's.  Highly recommend!!

Review: Found this pizza place on yelp and decided to try. Did not disappoint!

That was the BEST pizza I have ever had in Dallas and I have lived here since 1995.

That crust is perfection with just the right balance of crispness, chew, & taste.
And the sauce is really flavorful!! Don't miss trying the Portobello pizza! 

Vinny was extremely helpful explaining all the options and Ferrari Favorites! 
5 stars all around!

Review: Run to Ferrari's if you are looking for some awesome NY style pizza. There are many spots around DFW that claim to have NY style pizza, but they are not it. This place does it right and it's probably because the owner and his family are all from NY. I'm a purist, so I always go for a regular/plain cheese slice and this place does not disappoint. I even took a whole pie home so I have lunch for the week!

My wife is a bit more adventurous and tries different things off the menu, which always is on point as well. This time she tried their chicken cutlet hero and she loved it!

We will frequent this place for as long as we live in this metroplex!

Review: Pizza and calzones have always been on point. They have some good speciality pizzas like the Buffalo Chicken pizza. 

The calzone was ~$11 with pepperoni. 

Some of the speciality pizzas can get a little pricey 

Staff was friendly and had plenty of space to sit down and eat while I assume it has a lot of takeout business.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Closest thing to the NY style slice I've had here in Dallas. Love their grandma slice, chicken parm slice (specialty pie that comes out on Fridays) 

It's nestled in an ordinary little strip mall and easy to miss - seems like a neighborhood joint with lots of regulars. They have great pizza but if you go later like 7pm, you'll have limited choices and they dont seem to make fresh pies closer to closing which I understand. Do get their tiramisu, an absolute must!

Cashier service has always been courteous but never that friendly. Not a deal breaker for me but to some maybe.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Ferrari's Pizza has some of the best pizza. However, I have to give them 3 stars because their other food options were disappointing. The mozzarella sticks tasted like something you'd grab from a freezer aisle, and the calamari was a major letdown more batter than calamari, and we ended up throwing it out.
That said, we'll definitely continue visiting but will stick strictly to the pizza.If you're a pizza lover, this place is a must try. For anything else, I'd recommend passing.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Really pleased with this place. Service was friendly and the pizza was yummy. It's thin crust, large in size, and did not give me acid reflux. Always a win! The garlic knots and pizza rolls are ok. I'd just stick to the pizza next time. 

Still looking for the extra special pizza so that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I'll know when I taste it. Other than that, the pizza is good and is worth a try.

Review: Wow! Finally a great NY style pizza right here in Plano. After searching for this type of pizzeria for 2 years, we finally found Ferrari's Pizza, and it did not disappoint. They have a fantastic selection of pizzas, and the sizes are generous.

We ordered an 18" pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeno, and it was devoured by our family of four. The kids loved it, and the quality of the pizza was outstanding.

The service was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable for what you get. They also offer a good selection of alcohol, which is a nice bonus. We even met Vinny, the owner, who is a great guy from New York, adding an authentic touch to the whole experience.

We will definitely be back and highly recommend Ferrari's Pizza to anyone looking for an authentic NY pizza experience in Plano.

Review: Came over on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Not too busy and staff was friendly. Very good pizza, what I think of when I want New York style pizza. Thin, crisp crust with a tangy sauce and lots of cheese. Got a slice of cheese and the Grandma slice. Both were exceptional.

Can't wait to come back and try other menu items. Well done!

Review: When you hear Ferrari.... You think high end, world class, luxurious.
But for me it's just big pizza....
Nothing fancy, just big... pretty mediocre.
Service was pretty mediocre, though I will say I was only there to pick up my pizza.
I do plan to go back and dine in.
The place looks nice but just your standard small pizza place. 

Over all it's pretty forgettable 
I'd give it another try...
But I'm in no rush

Review: I ordered a pie for pick up... I was told this place was very "New York" but I had my doubts as "real" NYC pizza is hard to find in the DFW area. I was pleasantly surprised at the look of the pizza after unboxing. Flavor , sauce , cheese, foldability of the slice, and overall quality checked out. Will definitely be coming back. Fuggetabout stars, I give this place 5 out of 5 marons!

Review: I kept hearing such great things about this place figured I'd give them a try. Well I guess I caught them on a bad day there was only one girl working. Not sure if she is the usual pizza maker or not but she was doing it all herself. With that being said it definitely match the expectations. It wasn't bad but for $44 dollars I would have expected better from 2 14in pizzas.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: It was mediocre at best.  I placed my order online and arrived a few minutes prior to the expected ready time.    The counter guy was on the phone and took several minutes to take an order, then answered another call before getting to me.   That was several minutes.   My pizza was ready.  The pizza itself was warm, but not hot.   It had very little cheese or toppings.   For a $30.00 pizza it was very dissappointing.  Literally any of the chains would have been better at half the cost.  Go somewhere else.

Review: This is in a two way tie for my favorite pizza in the metroplex and I'm blessed that it is not far away. They get about as close as you can get to NYC pizza without having to catch a train and fight a few giant rats along the way. One taste and if you know, you know, you know?? 

Sometimes I can't talk the family into a whole pizza, which never lasts long anyway, and I'll stop by for a slice. My kids don't eat the crust, they didn't get that from my side. More for me. The crust has the chew you want. The sauce and cheese ratio, they nailed it. It tastes like they even have NYC tap water in the dough. Bolognese is fantastic. House sausage if you want a good slice, that's all you need. What more do I gotta say? It's a perfect slice.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: The ONLY actual NY-style pizza place nearby. Since moving from NY in 2021, I had given up on finding good pizza here. Luckily, Ferrari's was 5 min from one of my errands so I decided to stop by - so glad I did! I got a plain slice (I cried happy tears as I folded the slice, New Yorker style) and a delicious grandma slice (I've never even heard that word here).

Wish it was closer to my house!

Review: I wouldn't have written a review about the stale dry pizza and bread, empty ice machine, broken bathroom latch or disjointed service where my wife didn't get her sandwich until the other 7 in our party of 8 were finished eating.  But when the owner loudly says to my wife "Way to make a scene" for simply asking about her sandwich after everyone else in our party is finished eating, I feel like I should let others know.  When I ask him why he is making a scene when all she did was ask for her meal and he tells me this is a counter service place, as if that means they don't have to care about service or their customer, I need to write a review.  (Others in our party had orders that were cooked and not simply reheated and their food was also served and eaten before my wife's ever came out.)  I asked him not to talk to my wife that way and he asked me "what are you gonna do?"   So if I can't beat up the owner then he can talk to my wife (and you) however he wants.  Yes, when that happens I need to let others know.  When he then announces to the restaurant my wife is high maintenance I need to write a review.  One look at this "restaurant" will tell you the owner is no authority on "maintenance."

Don't waste your time or money on this "restaurant" or its angry owner.  Maintenance is low, food quality lower and the service and pride in ownership is embarrassing and downright shameful.

Review: I haven't lived near this place in over 10 years but I make the 30 minute drive and pass a million other pizza restaurants to go here specifically as often as I can. You're doing yourself a disservice if you pass them up.

Review: Found this pizza place on yelp and decided to try. Did not disappoint!

That was the BEST pizza I have ever had in Dallas and I have lived here since 1995.

That crust is perfection with just the right balance of crispness, chew, & taste.
And the sauce is really flavorful!! Don't miss trying the Portobello pizza! 

Vinny was extremely helpful explaining all the options and Ferrari Favorites! 
5 stars all around!

Review: Run to Ferrari's if you are looking for some awesome NY style pizza. There are many spots around DFW that claim to have NY style pizza, but they are not it. This place does it right and it's probably because the owner and his family are all from NY. I'm a purist, so I always go for a regular/plain cheese slice and this place does not disappoint. I even took a whole pie home so I have lunch for the week!

My wife is a bit more adventurous and tries different things off the menu, which always is on point as well. This time she tried their chicken cutlet hero and she loved it!

We will frequent this place for as long as we live in this metroplex!

Review: Pizza and calzones have always been on point. They have some good speciality pizzas like the Buffalo Chicken pizza. 

The calzone was ~$11 with pepperoni. 

Some of the speciality pizzas can get a little pricey 

Staff was friendly and had plenty of space to sit down and eat while I assume it has a lot of takeout business.

Review: Closest thing to the NY style slice I've had here in Dallas. Love their grandma slice, chicken parm slice (specialty pie that comes out on Fridays) 

It's nestled in an ordinary little strip mall and easy to miss - seems like a neighborhood joint with lots of regulars. They have great pizza but if you go later like 7pm, you'll have limited choices and they dont seem to make fresh pies closer to closing which I understand. Do get their tiramisu, an absolute must!

Cashier service has always been courteous but never that friendly. Not a deal breaker for me but to some maybe.

Review: Ferrari's Pizza has some of the best pizza. However, I have to give them 3 stars because their other food options were disappointing. The mozzarella sticks tasted like something you'd grab from a freezer aisle, and the calamari was a major letdown more batter than calamari, and we ended up throwing it out.
That said, we'll definitely continue visiting but will stick strictly to the pizza.If you're a pizza lover, this place is a must try. For anything else, I'd recommend passing.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Really pleased with this place. Service was friendly and the pizza was yummy. It's thin crust, large in size, and did not give me acid reflux. Always a win! The garlic knots and pizza rolls are ok. I'd just stick to the pizza next time. 

Still looking for the extra special pizza so that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I'll know when I taste it. Other than that, the pizza is good and is worth a try.

Review: Wow! Finally a great NY style pizza right here in Plano. After searching for this type of pizzeria for 2 years, we finally found Ferrari's Pizza, and it did not disappoint. They have a fantastic selection of pizzas, and the sizes are generous.

We ordered an 18" pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeno, and it was devoured by our family of four. The kids loved it, and the quality of the pizza was outstanding.

The service was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable for what you get. They also offer a good selection of alcohol, which is a nice bonus. We even met Vinny, the owner, who is a great guy from New York, adding an authentic touch to the whole experience.

We will definitely be back and highly recommend Ferrari's Pizza to anyone looking for an authentic NY pizza experience in Plano.

Review: Came over on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Not too busy and staff was friendly. Very good pizza, what I think of when I want New York style pizza. Thin, crisp crust with a tangy sauce and lots of cheese. Got a slice of cheese and the Grandma slice. Both were exceptional.

Can't wait to come back and try other menu items. Well done!

Review: When you hear Ferrari.... You think high end, world class, luxurious.
But for me it's just big pizza....
Nothing fancy, just big... pretty mediocre.
Service was pretty mediocre, though I will say I was only there to pick up my pizza.
I do plan to go back and dine in.
The place looks nice but just your standard small pizza place. 

Over all it's pretty forgettable 
I'd give it another try...
But I'm in no rush

Review: I ordered a pie for pick up... I was told this place was very "New York" but I had my doubts as "real" NYC pizza is hard to find in the DFW area. I was pleasantly surprised at the look of the pizza after unboxing. Flavor , sauce , cheese, foldability of the slice, and overall quality checked out. Will definitely be coming back. Fuggetabout stars, I give this place 5 out of 5 marons!

Review: I kept hearing such great things about this place figured I'd give them a try. Well I guess I caught them on a bad day there was only one girl working. Not sure if she is the usual pizza maker or not but she was doing it all herself. With that being said it definitely match the expectations. It wasn't bad but for $44 dollars I would have expected better from 2 14in pizzas.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: It was mediocre at best.  I placed my order online and arrived a few minutes prior to the expected ready time.    The counter guy was on the phone and took several minutes to take an order, then answered another call before getting to me.   That was several minutes.   My pizza was ready.  The pizza itself was warm, but not hot.   It had very little cheese or toppings.   For a $30.00 pizza it was very dissappointing.  Literally any of the chains would have been better at half the cost.  Go somewhere else.

Review: This is in a two way tie for my favorite pizza in the metroplex and I'm blessed that it is not far away. They get about as close as you can get to NYC pizza without having to catch a train and fight a few giant rats along the way. One taste and if you know, you know, you know?? 

Sometimes I can't talk the family into a whole pizza, which never lasts long anyway, and I'll stop by for a slice. My kids don't eat the crust, they didn't get that from my side. More for me. The crust has the chew you want. The sauce and cheese ratio, they nailed it. It tastes like they even have NYC tap water in the dough. Bolognese is fantastic. House sausage if you want a good slice, that's all you need. What more do I gotta say? It's a perfect slice.

Review: The ONLY actual NY-style pizza place nearby. Since moving from NY in 2021, I had given up on finding good pizza here. Luckily, Ferrari's was 5 min from one of my errands so I decided to stop by - so glad I did! I got a plain slice (I cried happy tears as I folded the slice, New Yorker style) and a delicious grandma slice (I've never even heard that word here).

Wish it was closer to my house!

Review: I wouldn't have written a review about the stale dry pizza and bread, empty ice machine, broken bathroom latch or disjointed service where my wife didn't get her sandwich until the other 7 in our party of 8 were finished eating.  But when the owner loudly says to my wife "Way to make a scene" for simply asking about her sandwich after everyone else in our party is finished eating, I feel like I should let others know.  When I ask him why he is making a scene when all she did was ask for her meal and he tells me this is a counter service place, as if that means they don't have to care about service or their customer, I need to write a review.  (Others in our party had orders that were cooked and not simply reheated and their food was also served and eaten before my wife's ever came out.)  I asked him not to talk to my wife that way and he asked me "what are you gonna do?"   So if I can't beat up the owner then he can talk to my wife (and you) however he wants.  Yes, when that happens I need to let others know.  When he then announces to the restaurant my wife is high maintenance I need to write a review.  One look at this "restaurant" will tell you the owner is no authority on "maintenance."

Don't waste your time or money on this "restaurant" or its angry owner.  Maintenance is low, food quality lower and the service and pride in ownership is embarrassing and downright shameful.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Staff is great, friendly, courteous, and helpful. Ambience is nice. Food is good, not great for the price.

Last time we got a whole Sicilian pie, we had a reheat it and cook it for quite a while before it was actually "done", and not a bunch of uncooked dough. And for the amount we paid for it, the topping seemed really sparse.

Review: Been coming here for years! Actually we order it once a week. Hands down the best pizza in DFW. Full stop. And believe me we've tried a lot of pizza since we've moved here from Miami! It's a perfect New York style pizza with a thick crust on the end and then thin the rest of the way just as it should be. Absolute perfection! 

Just go, it's great pizza! :)

Review: 1 star is waaaaaaay too high for this place.  Last time I checked customer service is a thing.  From the moment we walked in the guy at the register was rude.  We didn't get menus, were not even greeted, and had no idea if we were to order at the register or if they came to the table.  When I asked this guy...he seemed put out and had an attitude.  I thought it was just me but the customer behind me asked if he was being snarky to me.  This was our first time AND LAST time we will eat here.
None of the food came out together which I understand.  Most of us were finished eating when the last meal came out.  When we inquired about it this guy started accusing us of "making a scene" and being "high maintenance".  He also said since they are counter service they don't have to worry about customer service.  

The food was barely Meh and then the service...save yourself don't eat here!

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I went on a Saturday and was not disappointed. The restaurant is clean, nice radio station. We were greeted by a friendly counter person, and the available pies, which looked amazing. The house pie is front and center cheese and sauce. Add topping to your slice, and they bring it out to your table. We went with sauce and cheese, and it was terrific. The crust is worth up to a 50-mile travel. So, let's say it's a 50-mile crust--crisp, flavorful, and perfect color.

Review: Food- Had their house size pizza which is amazing! Reminded my wife of the pizza she used to eat back in the east coast. Massive pie, delicious sauce, just enough cheese, and a really thin crust. 

Service - I picked up the pizza but the staff was so kind! Had two kids with me and one of those is a baby who needed to be held. The team on site recognized my struggle and insisted on taking the pie to my car while I held the baby and my other child. Such a nice gesture which you don't often see these days. Thank you!

Very happy about the food and the service. We'll definitely be back!

Review: Quiet, kinda small place but I always get pizza for takeout so it's fine. Pizza here is amazing, you can tell that it's homemade as they take 10-20 mins to make each pizza. I always order the Mediterranean Pie (pesto and alfredo sauce, sundried tomatoes, feta and mozzarella) and it's so delicious. I've also order the Alfredo which was also pretty good.

Review: This Pizza place when I went in was an owner operated restaurant. Love was put into their food. For a Texas pizza place it was a hit and good quality. New York style pizza. I had better in New York but if you live here you want to go. The meatballs and sauce impressed me and were very good and I would highly recommend them. The ambience and seating was a closet small feeling. Service was fine. More or less I would return.

Review: Found this Italian owned pizzeria by accident tonight while heading back to Northern Collin County. The place was clean, had great service, and I will return when I am in the area. 

We ordered the largest meat pizza they had for a party of 5 including two hungry teenage boys after their football game. They devoured the pie. 

The toppings were flavorful. The sauce was delicious. The crust was thin and perfect. 

Unfortunately the pie was finished before we could even get a picture, but the pics others have posted are accurate. 

I recommend their thin crust pizza over any others in the area. Go try them out! You won't regret it. 

Ciao.

Review: It says pizza right in the name so maybe I should have gotten the pizza. But I wanted pasta and they had it so I ordered it. And it was not great.

I ordered the carbonara which came with a white sauce. I would guess it's Alfredo sauce but guessing is all you can do because the flavor was absent. It was a bit soupy and was so nothing that I added ketchup when I got home and I'm not even kidding. If this is typical of the pasta sauce I would say maybe they should take it off the menu.

That said, the peas and prosciutto were flavorful and perfect. So it's an easy enough thing to fix if they are motivated to do so. [Edit: They do not seem motivated to do so.] I will skip revisit since the owner said on Yelp that I'm not welcomed due to my opinion of the pasta sauce. Thankfully there are other shops in town with both better food and more pleasant owners.

Review: I'm a New Yorker born and raised 40 years before moving down to Texas and when I tell you this Owner is truly a native New Yorker with New York style pizza from the aroma, to the perfection on the crust...  drove from Dallas and worth the drive and won't be the last trip. Service is on point and the place is clean to perfection.

Review: We've been searching several years for good New York style pizza. This place had been recommended several times in a Facebook foodie group.  We're glad we finally had a chance to stop in. The pizza was delicious. We'll definitely be back to try more pies!

Review: I'm going to try to keep this this brief. We ordered from them Friday night. Our order of ten wings came with eight. The pizza, was a "baked ziti pie" which sounded awesome because we love spaghetti pizza. With ordered a few extra toppings, and it actually looked "okay" when we got home. But here's the thing - the pasta was over-cooked, the pink sauce it was in was broken & grainy, and the remainder of the toppings had little to no flavor. The crust was not cut through and so tough that it was nearly inedible. 

I'd let this all go if the business had not decided to start volleying personal attacks suggesting we get COVID tests and totaling avoiding the fact they shorted our order. The restaurant uses a generic purveyor of frozen pizza ingredients, from dough to toppings (Lisanti - who basically distributes a turnkey, mass-produced, frozen, bland product). Their dough shows no evidence of being house-made. What they do show is a dogged approach to attacking anyone who does not like their products.

There are plenty of other options locally working from scratch. Campisi's & Zalat come to mind.

Review: When moving into a new area, finding a good New York pizza is as important to me as finding a good barber.  Having lived over 20 years in New York City and having eaten good NY pizza, I was thrilled to find great NY pizza in the area.  

The three of us ordered a 22-inch plain cheese pie and a cannoli to share. The cannoli was freshly filled so it retained the crispy shell.  The cream filling was not overly sweet and its overall consistency was very good. 

My wife and I agreed the pizza itself was the best NY pizza we've had since leaving NY about 25 years ago.  The slices were perfectly foldable, nicely crispy on the outside and the right amount of chewy inside.  The crust was not too salty and the sauce to cheese ratio was excellent.  As legitimate NY slices often do, these almost burned the roof of my mouth and a few drops of oil from the cheese fell on the paper plate.  The pie was huge so we took plenty of leftovers home. 

The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was spacious and super clean.  If you're looking for an authentic NY pizza, you won't be disappointed with Ferrari's.  Highly recommend!!

I asked him not to talk to my wife that way and he asked me "what are you gonna do?"   So if I can't beat up the owner then he can talk to my wife (and you) however he wants.  Yes, when that happens I need to let others know.  When he then announces to the restaurant my wife is high maintenance I need to write a review.  One look at this "restaurant" will tell you the owner is no authority on "maintenance."

Don't waste your time or money on this "restaurant" or its angry owner.  Maintenance is low, food quality lower and the service and pride in ownership is embarrassing and downright shameful.

Review: Staff is great, friendly, courteous, and helpful. Ambience is nice. Food is good, not great for the price.

Last time we got a whole Sicilian pie, we had a reheat it and cook it for quite a while before it was actually "done", and not a bunch of uncooked dough. And for the amount we paid for it, the topping seemed really sparse.

Review: Been coming here for years! Actually we order it once a week. Hands down the best pizza in DFW. Full stop. And believe me we've tried a lot of pizza since we've moved here from Miami! It's a perfect New York style pizza with a thick crust on the end and then thin the rest of the way just as it should be. Absolute perfection! 

Just go, it's great pizza! :)

Review: 1 star is waaaaaaay too high for this place.  Last time I checked customer service is a thing.  From the moment we walked in the guy at the register was rude.  We didn't get menus, were not even greeted, and had no idea if we were to order at the register or if they came to the table.  When I asked this guy...he seemed put out and had an attitude.  I thought it was just me but the customer behind me asked if he was being snarky to me.  This was our first time AND LAST time we will eat here.
None of the food came out together which I understand.  Most of us were finished eating when the last meal came out.  When we inquired about it this guy started accusing us of "making a scene" and being "high maintenance".  He also said since they are counter service they don't have to worry about customer service.  

The food was barely Meh and then the service...save yourself don't eat here!

Review: I went on a Saturday and was not disappointed. The restaurant is clean, nice radio station. We were greeted by a friendly counter person, and the available pies, which looked amazing. The house pie is front and center cheese and sauce. Add topping to your slice, and they bring it out to your table. We went with sauce and cheese, and it was terrific. The crust is worth up to a 50-mile travel. So, let's say it's a 50-mile crust--crisp, flavorful, and perfect color.

Review: Food- Had their house size pizza which is amazing! Reminded my wife of the pizza she used to eat back in the east coast. Massive pie, delicious sauce, just enough cheese, and a really thin crust. 

Service - I picked up the pizza but the staff was so kind! Had two kids with me and one of those is a baby who needed to be held. The team on site recognized my struggle and insisted on taking the pie to my car while I held the baby and my other child. Such a nice gesture which you don't often see these days. Thank you!

Very happy about the food and the service. We'll definitely be back!

Review: Quiet, kinda small place but I always get pizza for takeout so it's fine. Pizza here is amazing, you can tell that it's homemade as they take 10-20 mins to make each pizza. I always order the Mediterranean Pie (pesto and alfredo sauce, sundried tomatoes, feta and mozzarella) and it's so delicious. I've also order the Alfredo which was also pretty good.

Review: This Pizza place when I went in was an owner operated restaurant. Love was put into their food. For a Texas pizza place it was a hit and good quality. New York style pizza. I had better in New York but if you live here you want to go. The meatballs and sauce impressed me and were very good and I would highly recommend them. The ambience and seating was a closet small feeling. Service was fine. More or less I would return.

Review: Found this Italian owned pizzeria by accident tonight while heading back to Northern Collin County. The place was clean, had great service, and I will return when I am in the area. 

We ordered the largest meat pizza they had for a party of 5 including two hungry teenage boys after their football game. They devoured the pie. 

The toppings were flavorful. The sauce was delicious. The crust was thin and perfect. 

Unfortunately the pie was finished before we could even get a picture, but the pics others have posted are accurate. 

I recommend their thin crust pizza over any others in the area. Go try them out! You won't regret it. 

Ciao.

Review: It says pizza right in the name so maybe I should have gotten the pizza. But I wanted pasta and they had it so I ordered it. And it was not great.

I ordered the carbonara which came with a white sauce. I would guess it's Alfredo sauce but guessing is all you can do because the flavor was absent. It was a bit soupy and was so nothing that I added ketchup when I got home and I'm not even kidding. If this is typical of the pasta sauce I would say maybe they should take it off the menu.

That said, the peas and prosciutto were flavorful and perfect. So it's an easy enough thing to fix if they are motivated to do so. [Edit: They do not seem motivated to do so.] I will skip revisit since the owner said on Yelp that I'm not welcomed due to my opinion of the pasta sauce. Thankfully there are other shops in town with both better food and more pleasant owners.

Review: I'm going to try to keep this this brief. We ordered from them Friday night. Our order of ten wings came with eight. The pizza, was a "baked ziti pie" which sounded awesome because we love spaghetti pizza. With ordered a few extra toppings, and it actually looked "okay" when we got home. But here's the thing - the pasta was over-cooked, the pink sauce it was in was broken & grainy, and the remainder of the toppings had little to no flavor. The crust was not cut through and so tough that it was nearly inedible. 

I'd let this all go if the business had not decided to start volleying personal attacks suggesting we get COVID tests and totaling avoiding the fact they shorted our order. The restaurant uses a generic purveyor of frozen pizza ingredients, from dough to toppings (Lisanti - who basically distributes a turnkey, mass-produced, frozen, bland product). Their dough shows no evidence of being house-made. What they do show is a dogged approach to attacking anyone who does not like their products.

There are plenty of other options locally working from scratch. Campisi's & Zalat come to mind.

Review: When moving into a new area, finding a good New York pizza is as important to me as finding a good barber.  Having lived over 20 years in New York City and having eaten good NY pizza, I was thrilled to find great NY pizza in the area.  

The three of us ordered a 22-inch plain cheese pie and a cannoli to share. The cannoli was freshly filled so it retained the crispy shell.  The cream filling was not overly sweet and its overall consistency was very good. 

My wife and I agreed the pizza itself was the best NY pizza we've had since leaving NY about 25 years ago.  The slices were perfectly foldable, nicely crispy on the outside and the right amount of chewy inside.  The crust was not too salty and the sauce to cheese ratio was excellent.  As legitimate NY slices often do, these almost burned the roof of my mouth and a few drops of oil from the cheese fell on the paper plate.  The pie was huge so we took plenty of leftovers home. 

The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was spacious and super clean.  If you're looking for an authentic NY pizza, you won't be disappointed with Ferrari's.  Highly recommend!!

My sister said she will be coming back again, and I definitely will ask her to take me here when I come back to visit.

Review: Found this pizza place on yelp and decided to try. Did not disappoint!

That was the BEST pizza I have ever had in Dallas and I have lived here since 1995.

That crust is perfection with just the right balance of crispness, chew, & taste.
And the sauce is really flavorful!! Don't miss trying the Portobello pizza! 

Vinny was extremely helpful explaining all the options and Ferrari Favorites! 
5 stars all around!

Review: Run to Ferrari's if you are looking for some awesome NY style pizza. There are many spots around DFW that claim to have NY style pizza, but they are not it. This place does it right and it's probably because the owner and his family are all from NY. I'm a purist, so I always go for a regular/plain cheese slice and this place does not disappoint. I even took a whole pie home so I have lunch for the week!

My wife is a bit more adventurous and tries different things off the menu, which always is on point as well. This time she tried their chicken cutlet hero and she loved it!

We will frequent this place for as long as we live in this metroplex!

Review: Pizza and calzones have always been on point. They have some good speciality pizzas like the Buffalo Chicken pizza. 

The calzone was ~$11 with pepperoni. 

Some of the speciality pizzas can get a little pricey 

Staff was friendly and had plenty of space to sit down and eat while I assume it has a lot of takeout business.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Closest thing to the NY style slice I've had here in Dallas. Love their grandma slice, chicken parm slice (specialty pie that comes out on Fridays) 

It's nestled in an ordinary little strip mall and easy to miss - seems like a neighborhood joint with lots of regulars. They have great pizza but if you go later like 7pm, you'll have limited choices and they dont seem to make fresh pies closer to closing which I understand. Do get their tiramisu, an absolute must!

Cashier service has always been courteous but never that friendly. Not a deal breaker for me but to some maybe.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Ferrari's Pizza has some of the best pizza. However, I have to give them 3 stars because their other food options were disappointing. The mozzarella sticks tasted like something you'd grab from a freezer aisle, and the calamari was a major letdown more batter than calamari, and we ended up throwing it out.
That said, we'll definitely continue visiting but will stick strictly to the pizza.If you're a pizza lover, this place is a must try. For anything else, I'd recommend passing.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Really pleased with this place. Service was friendly and the pizza was yummy. It's thin crust, large in size, and did not give me acid reflux. Always a win! The garlic knots and pizza rolls are ok. I'd just stick to the pizza next time. 

Still looking for the extra special pizza so that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I'll know when I taste it. Other than that, the pizza is good and is worth a try.

Review: Wow! Finally a great NY style pizza right here in Plano. After searching for this type of pizzeria for 2 years, we finally found Ferrari's Pizza, and it did not disappoint. They have a fantastic selection of pizzas, and the sizes are generous.

We ordered an 18" pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeno, and it was devoured by our family of four. The kids loved it, and the quality of the pizza was outstanding.

The service was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable for what you get. They also offer a good selection of alcohol, which is a nice bonus. We even met Vinny, the owner, who is a great guy from New York, adding an authentic touch to the whole experience.

We will definitely be back and highly recommend Ferrari's Pizza to anyone looking for an authentic NY pizza experience in Plano.

Review: Came over on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Not too busy and staff was friendly. Very good pizza, what I think of when I want New York style pizza. Thin, crisp crust with a tangy sauce and lots of cheese. Got a slice of cheese and the Grandma slice. Both were exceptional.

Can't wait to come back and try other menu items. Well done!

Review: When you hear Ferrari.... You think high end, world class, luxurious.
But for me it's just big pizza....
Nothing fancy, just big... pretty mediocre.
Service was pretty mediocre, though I will say I was only there to pick up my pizza.
I do plan to go back and dine in.
The place looks nice but just your standard small pizza place. 

Over all it's pretty forgettable 
I'd give it another try...
But I'm in no rush

Review: I ordered a pie for pick up... I was told this place was very "New York" but I had my doubts as "real" NYC pizza is hard to find in the DFW area. I was pleasantly surprised at the look of the pizza after unboxing. Flavor , sauce , cheese, foldability of the slice, and overall quality checked out. Will definitely be coming back. Fuggetabout stars, I give this place 5 out of 5 marons!

Review: I kept hearing such great things about this place figured I'd give them a try. Well I guess I caught them on a bad day there was only one girl working. Not sure if she is the usual pizza maker or not but she was doing it all herself. With that being said it definitely match the expectations. It wasn't bad but for $44 dollars I would have expected better from 2 14in pizzas.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: It was mediocre at best.  I placed my order online and arrived a few minutes prior to the expected ready time.    The counter guy was on the phone and took several minutes to take an order, then answered another call before getting to me.   That was several minutes.   My pizza was ready.  The pizza itself was warm, but not hot.   It had very little cheese or toppings.   For a $30.00 pizza it was very dissappointing.  Literally any of the chains would have been better at half the cost.  Go somewhere else.

Review: This is in a two way tie for my favorite pizza in the metroplex and I'm blessed that it is not far away. They get about as close as you can get to NYC pizza without having to catch a train and fight a few giant rats along the way. One taste and if you know, you know, you know?? 

Sometimes I can't talk the family into a whole pizza, which never lasts long anyway, and I'll stop by for a slice. My kids don't eat the crust, they didn't get that from my side. More for me. The crust has the chew you want. The sauce and cheese ratio, they nailed it. It tastes like they even have NYC tap water in the dough. Bolognese is fantastic. House sausage if you want a good slice, that's all you need. What more do I gotta say? It's a perfect slice.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: The ONLY actual NY-style pizza place nearby. Since moving from NY in 2021, I had given up on finding good pizza here. Luckily, Ferrari's was 5 min from one of my errands so I decided to stop by - so glad I did! I got a plain slice (I cried happy tears as I folded the slice, New Yorker style) and a delicious grandma slice (I've never even heard that word here).

Wish it was closer to my house!

Review: I wouldn't have written a review about the stale dry pizza and bread, empty ice machine, broken bathroom latch or disjointed service where my wife didn't get her sandwich until the other 7 in our party of 8 were finished eating.  But when the owner loudly says to my wife "Way to make a scene" for simply asking about her sandwich after everyone else in our party is finished eating, I feel like I should let others know.  When I ask him why he is making a scene when all she did was ask for her meal and he tells me this is a counter service place, as if that means they don't have to care about service or their customer, I need to write a review.

Review: If you want some of the best pizza of your life, get here...today! Seriously some of the best pizza we've ever had! We got the Bianca, Buffalo Chicken and pepperoni and all were phenomenal! Our friend from New York brought us and raves about it and now we know why! The staff is so sweet and such a great added perk to our visit!  We'll be back soon!

Review: Absolutely loved this place! Found this place when I was planning my trip for work/visiting my sister, and we were so glad I chose this place for lunch. On 3/24/24, we had mozzarella sticks and a large cheese pizza, and they were DELICIOUS! My sister said she will be coming back again, and I definitely will ask her to take me here when I come back to visit.

Review: Found this pizza place on yelp and decided to try. Did not disappoint!

That was the BEST pizza I have ever had in Dallas and I have lived here since 1995.

That crust is perfection with just the right balance of crispness, chew, & taste.
And the sauce is really flavorful!! Don't miss trying the Portobello pizza! 

Vinny was extremely helpful explaining all the options and Ferrari Favorites! 
5 stars all around!

Review: Run to Ferrari's if you are looking for some awesome NY style pizza. There are many spots around DFW that claim to have NY style pizza, but they are not it. This place does it right and it's probably because the owner and his family are all from NY. I'm a purist, so I always go for a regular/plain cheese slice and this place does not disappoint. I even took a whole pie home so I have lunch for the week!

My wife is a bit more adventurous and tries different things off the menu, which always is on point as well. This time she tried their chicken cutlet hero and she loved it!

We will frequent this place for as long as we live in this metroplex!

Review: Pizza and calzones have always been on point. They have some good speciality pizzas like the Buffalo Chicken pizza. 

The calzone was ~$11 with pepperoni. 

Some of the speciality pizzas can get a little pricey 

Staff was friendly and had plenty of space to sit down and eat while I assume it has a lot of takeout business.

Review: Closest thing to the NY style slice I've had here in Dallas. Love their grandma slice, chicken parm slice (specialty pie that comes out on Fridays) 

It's nestled in an ordinary little strip mall and easy to miss - seems like a neighborhood joint with lots of regulars. They have great pizza but if you go later like 7pm, you'll have limited choices and they dont seem to make fresh pies closer to closing which I understand. Do get their tiramisu, an absolute must!

Cashier service has always been courteous but never that friendly. Not a deal breaker for me but to some maybe.

Review: Ferrari's Pizza has some of the best pizza. However, I have to give them 3 stars because their other food options were disappointing. The mozzarella sticks tasted like something you'd grab from a freezer aisle, and the calamari was a major letdown more batter than calamari, and we ended up throwing it out.
That said, we'll definitely continue visiting but will stick strictly to the pizza.If you're a pizza lover, this place is a must try. For anything else, I'd recommend passing.

Review: Really pleased with this place. Service was friendly and the pizza was yummy. It's thin crust, large in size, and did not give me acid reflux. Always a win! The garlic knots and pizza rolls are ok. I'd just stick to the pizza next time. 

Still looking for the extra special pizza so that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I'll know when I taste it. Other than that, the pizza is good and is worth a try.

Review: Wow! Finally a great NY style pizza right here in Plano. After searching for this type of pizzeria for 2 years, we finally found Ferrari's Pizza, and it did not disappoint. They have a fantastic selection of pizzas, and the sizes are generous.

We ordered an 18" pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeno, and it was devoured by our family of four. The kids loved it, and the quality of the pizza was outstanding.

The service was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable for what you get. They also offer a good selection of alcohol, which is a nice bonus. We even met Vinny, the owner, who is a great guy from New York, adding an authentic touch to the whole experience.

We will definitely be back and highly recommend Ferrari's Pizza to anyone looking for an authentic NY pizza experience in Plano.

Can't wait to come back and try other menu items. Well done!

Review: When you hear Ferrari.... You think high end, world class, luxurious.
But for me it's just big pizza....
Nothing fancy, just big... pretty mediocre.
Service was pretty mediocre, though I will say I was only there to pick up my pizza.
I do plan to go back and dine in.
The place looks nice but just your standard small pizza place. 

Over all it's pretty forgettable 
I'd give it another try...
But I'm in no rush

Review: I ordered a pie for pick up... I was told this place was very "New York" but I had my doubts as "real" NYC pizza is hard to find in the DFW area.

Fuggetabout stars, I give this place 5 out of 5 marons!

Review: I kept hearing such great things about this place figured I'd give them a try. Well I guess I caught them on a bad day there was only one girl working. Not sure if she is the usual pizza maker or not but she was doing it all herself. With that being said it definitely match the expectations. It wasn't bad but for $44 dollars I would have expected better from 2 14in pizzas.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: It was mediocre at best.  I placed my order online and arrived a few minutes prior to the expected ready time.    The counter guy was on the phone and took several minutes to take an order, then answered another call before getting to me.   That was several minutes.   My pizza was ready.  The pizza itself was warm, but not hot.   It had very little cheese or toppings.   For a $30.00 pizza it was very dissappointing.  Literally any of the chains would have been better at half the cost.  Go somewhere else.

Review: This is in a two way tie for my favorite pizza in the metroplex and I'm blessed that it is not far away. They get about as close as you can get to NYC pizza without having to catch a train and fight a few giant rats along the way. One taste and if you know, you know, you know?? 

Sometimes I can't talk the family into a whole pizza, which never lasts long anyway, and I'll stop by for a slice. My kids don't eat the crust, they didn't get that from my side. More for me. The crust has the chew you want. The sauce and cheese ratio, they nailed it. It tastes like they even have NYC tap water in the dough. Bolognese is fantastic. House sausage if you want a good slice, that's all you need. What more do I gotta say? It's a perfect slice.

Review: The ONLY actual NY-style pizza place nearby. Since moving from NY in 2021, I had given up on finding good pizza here. Luckily, Ferrari's was 5 min from one of my errands so I decided to stop by - so glad I did! I got a plain slice (I cried happy tears as I folded the slice, New Yorker style) and a delicious grandma slice (I've never even heard that word here).

Wish it was closer to my house!

Review: I wouldn't have written a review about the stale dry pizza and bread, empty ice machine, broken bathroom latch or disjointed service where my wife didn't get her sandwich until the other 7 in our party of 8 were finished eating.  But when the owner loudly says to my wife "Way to make a scene" for simply asking about her sandwich after everyone else in our party is finished eating, I feel like I should let others know.  When I ask him why he is making a scene when all she did was ask for her meal and he tells me this is a counter service place, as if that means they don't have to care about service or their customer, I need to write a review.  (Others in our party had orders that were cooked and not simply reheated and their food was also served and eaten before my wife's ever came out.)  I asked him not to talk to my wife that way and he asked me "what are you gonna do?"   So if I can't beat up the owner then he can talk to my wife (and you) however he wants.  Yes, when that happens I need to let others know.  When he then announces to the restaurant my wife is high maintenance I need to write a review.  One look at this "restaurant" will tell you the owner is no authority on "maintenance."

Don't waste your time or money on this "restaurant" or its angry owner.  Maintenance is low, food quality lower and the service and pride in ownership is embarrassing and downright shameful.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Staff is great, friendly, courteous, and helpful. Ambience is nice. Food is good, not great for the price.

Last time we got a whole Sicilian pie, we had a reheat it and cook it for quite a while before it was actually "done", and not a bunch of uncooked dough. And for the amount we paid for it, the topping seemed really sparse.

Review: Been coming here for years! Actually we order it once a week. Hands down the best pizza in DFW. Full stop. And believe me we've tried a lot of pizza since we've moved here from Miami! It's a perfect New York style pizza with a thick crust on the end and then thin the rest of the way just as it should be. Absolute perfection! 

Just go, it's great pizza! :)

Review: 1 star is waaaaaaay too high for this place.  Last time I checked customer service is a thing.  From the moment we walked in the guy at the register was rude.  We didn't get menus, were not even greeted, and had no idea if we were to order at the register or if they came to the table.  When I asked this guy...he seemed put out and had an attitude.  I thought it was just me but the customer behind me asked if he was being snarky to me.  This was our first time AND LAST time we will eat here.
None of the food came out together which I understand.  Most of us were finished eating when the last meal came out.  When we inquired about it this guy started accusing us of "making a scene" and being "high maintenance".  He also said since they are counter service they don't have to worry about customer service.  

The food was barely Meh and then the service...save yourself don't eat here!

Review: I went on a Saturday and was not disappointed. The restaurant is clean, nice radio station. We were greeted by a friendly counter person, and the available pies, which looked amazing. The house pie is front and center cheese and sauce. Add topping to your slice, and they bring it out to your table. We went with sauce and cheese, and it was terrific. The crust is worth up to a 50-mile travel. So, let's say it's a 50-mile crust--crisp, flavorful, and perfect color.

Review: Food- Had their house size pizza which is amazing! Reminded my wife of the pizza she used to eat back in the east coast. Massive pie, delicious sauce, just enough cheese, and a really thin crust. 

Service - I picked up the pizza but the staff was so kind! Had two kids with me and one of those is a baby who needed to be held. The team on site recognized my struggle and insisted on taking the pie to my car while I held the baby and my other child. Such a nice gesture which you don't often see these days. Thank you!

Very happy about the food and the service. We'll definitely be back!

Review: Quiet, kinda small place but I always get pizza for takeout so it's fine. Pizza here is amazing, you can tell that it's homemade as they take 10-20 mins to make each pizza. I always order the Mediterranean Pie (pesto and alfredo sauce, sundried tomatoes, feta and mozzarella) and it's so delicious. I've also order the Alfredo which was also pretty good.

Review: This Pizza place when I went in was an owner operated restaurant. Love was put into their food. For a Texas pizza place it was a hit and good quality. New York style pizza. I had better in New York but if you live here you want to go. The meatballs and sauce impressed me and were very good and I would highly recommend them. The ambience and seating was a closet small feeling. Service was fine. More or less I would return.

Review: Found this Italian owned pizzeria by accident tonight while heading back to Northern Collin County. The place was clean, had great service, and I will return when I am in the area. 

We ordered the largest meat pizza they had for a party of 5 including two hungry teenage boys after their football game. They devoured the pie. 

The toppings were flavorful. The sauce was delicious. The crust was thin and perfect. 

Unfortunately the pie was finished before we could even get a picture, but the pics others have posted are accurate. 

I recommend their thin crust pizza over any others in the area. Go try them out! You won't regret it. 

Ciao.

Review: It says pizza right in the name so maybe I should have gotten the pizza. But I wanted pasta and they had it so I ordered it. And it was not great.

I ordered the carbonara which came with a white sauce. I would guess it's Alfredo sauce but guessing is all you can do because the flavor was absent. It was a bit soupy and was so nothing that I added ketchup when I got home and I'm not even kidding. If this is typical of the pasta sauce I would say maybe they should take it off the menu.

That said, the peas and prosciutto were flavorful and perfect. So it's an easy enough thing to fix if they are motivated to do so. [Edit: They do not seem motivated to do so.] I will skip revisit since the owner said on Yelp that I'm not welcomed due to my opinion of the pasta sauce. Thankfully there are other shops in town with both better food and more pleasant owners.

Review: I'm a New Yorker born and raised 40 years before moving down to Texas and when I tell you this Owner is truly a native New Yorker with New York style pizza from the aroma, to the perfection on the crust...  drove from Dallas and worth the drive and won't be the last trip. Service is on point and the place is clean to perfection.

Review: We've been searching several years for good New York style pizza. This place had been recommended several times in a Facebook foodie group.  We're glad we finally had a chance to stop in. The pizza was delicious. We'll definitely be back to try more pies!

Review: I'm going to try to keep this this brief. We ordered from them Friday night. Our order of ten wings came with eight. The pizza, was a "baked ziti pie" which sounded awesome because we love spaghetti pizza. With ordered a few extra toppings, and it actually looked "okay" when we got home. But here's the thing - the pasta was over-cooked, the pink sauce it was in was broken & grainy, and the remainder of the toppings had little to no flavor. The crust was not cut through and so tough that it was nearly inedible. 

I'd let this all go if the business had not decided to start volleying personal attacks suggesting we get COVID tests and totaling avoiding the fact they shorted our order. The restaurant uses a generic purveyor of frozen pizza ingredients, from dough to toppings (Lisanti - who basically distributes a turnkey, mass-produced, frozen, bland product). Their dough shows no evidence of being house-made. What they do show is a dogged approach to attacking anyone who does not like their products.

There are plenty of other options locally working from scratch. Campisi's & Zalat come to mind.

Review: When moving into a new area, finding a good New York pizza is as important to me as finding a good barber.  Having lived over 20 years in New York City and having eaten good NY pizza, I was thrilled to find great NY pizza in the area.  

The three of us ordered a 22-inch plain cheese pie and a cannoli to share. The cannoli was freshly filled so it retained the crispy shell.  The cream filling was not overly sweet and its overall consistency was very good. 

My wife and I agreed the pizza itself was the best NY pizza we've had since leaving NY about 25 years ago.  The slices were perfectly foldable, nicely crispy on the outside and the right amount of chewy inside.  The crust was not too salty and the sauce to cheese ratio was excellent.  As legitimate NY slices often do, these almost burned the roof of my mouth and a few drops of oil from the cheese fell on the paper plate.  The pie was huge so we took plenty of leftovers home. 

The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was spacious and super clean.  If you're looking for an authentic NY pizza, you won't be disappointed with Ferrari's.  Highly recommend!!

Wish it was closer to my house!

Review: I wouldn't have written a review about the stale dry pizza and bread, empty ice machine, broken bathroom latch or disjointed service where my wife didn't get her sandwich until the other 7 in our party of 8 were finished eating.  But when the owner loudly says to my wife "Way to make a scene" for simply asking about her sandwich after everyone else in our party is finished eating, I feel like I should let others know.  When I ask him why he is making a scene when all she did was ask for her meal and he tells me this is a counter service place, as if that means they don't have to care about service or their customer, I need to write a review.  (Others in our party had orders that were cooked and not simply reheated and their food was also served and eaten before my wife's ever came out.)  I asked him not to talk to my wife that way and he asked me "what are you gonna do?"   So if I can't beat up the owner then he can talk to my wife (and you) however he wants.  Yes, when that happens I need to let others know.  When he then announces to the restaurant my wife is high maintenance I need to write a review.  One look at this "restaurant" will tell you the owner is no authority on "maintenance."

Don't waste your time or money on this "restaurant" or its angry owner.  Maintenance is low, food quality lower and the service and pride in ownership is embarrassing and downright shameful.

Review: Staff is great, friendly, courteous, and helpful. Ambience is nice. Food is good, not great for the price.

Last time we got a whole Sicilian pie, we had a reheat it and cook it for quite a while before it was actually "done", and not a bunch of uncooked dough. And for the amount we paid for it, the topping seemed really sparse.

Review: Been coming here for years! Actually we order it once a week. Hands down the best pizza in DFW. Full stop. And believe me we've tried a lot of pizza since we've moved here from Miami! It's a perfect New York style pizza with a thick crust on the end and then thin the rest of the way just as it should be. Absolute perfection! 

Just go, it's great pizza! :)

Review: 1 star is waaaaaaay too high for this place.  Last time I checked customer service is a thing.  From the moment we walked in the guy at the register was rude.  We didn't get menus, were not even greeted, and had no idea if we were to order at the register or if they came to the table.  When I asked this guy...he seemed put out and had an attitude.  I thought it was just me but the customer behind me asked if he was being snarky to me.  This was our first time AND LAST time we will eat here.
None of the food came out together which I understand.  Most of us were finished eating when the last meal came out.  When we inquired about it this guy started accusing us of "making a scene" and being "high maintenance".  He also said since they are counter service they don't have to worry about customer service.  

The food was barely Meh and then the service...save yourself don't eat here!

Review: I went on a Saturday and was not disappointed. The restaurant is clean, nice radio station. We were greeted by a friendly counter person, and the available pies, which looked amazing. The house pie is front and center cheese and sauce. Add topping to your slice, and they bring it out to your table. We went with sauce and cheese, and it was terrific. The crust is worth up to a 50-mile travel. So, let's say it's a 50-mile crust--crisp, flavorful, and perfect color.

Review: Food- Had their house size pizza which is amazing! Reminded my wife of the pizza she used to eat back in the east coast. Massive pie, delicious sauce, just enough cheese, and a really thin crust. 

Service - I picked up the pizza but the staff was so kind! Had two kids with me and one of those is a baby who needed to be held. The team on site recognized my struggle and insisted on taking the pie to my car while I held the baby and my other child. Such a nice gesture which you don't often see these days. Thank you!

Very happy about the food and the service. We'll definitely be back!

Review: Quiet, kinda small place but I always get pizza for takeout so it's fine. Pizza here is amazing, you can tell that it's homemade as they take 10-20 mins to make each pizza.

Review: This Pizza place when I went in was an owner operated restaurant. Love was put into their food. For a Texas pizza place it was a hit and good quality. New York style pizza. I had better in New York but if you live here you want to go. The meatballs and sauce impressed me and were very good and I would highly recommend them. The ambience and seating was a closet small feeling. Service was fine. More or less I would return.

Review: Found this Italian owned pizzeria by accident tonight while heading back to Northern Collin County. The place was clean, had great service, and I will return when I am in the area. 

We ordered the largest meat pizza they had for a party of 5 including two hungry teenage boys after their football game. They devoured the pie. 

The toppings were flavorful. The sauce was delicious. The crust was thin and perfect. 

Unfortunately the pie was finished before we could even get a picture, but the pics others have posted are accurate. 

I recommend their thin crust pizza over any others in the area. Go try them out! You won't regret it. 

Ciao.

Review: It says pizza right in the name so maybe I should have gotten the pizza. But I wanted pasta and they had it so I ordered it. And it was not great.

I ordered the carbonara which came with a white sauce. I would guess it's Alfredo sauce but guessing is all you can do because the flavor was absent. It was a bit soupy and was so nothing that I added ketchup when I got home and I'm not even kidding. If this is typical of the pasta sauce I would say maybe they should take it off the menu.

That said, the peas and prosciutto were flavorful and perfect. So it's an easy enough thing to fix if they are motivated to do so. [Edit: They do not seem motivated to do so.] I will skip revisit since the owner said on Yelp that I'm not welcomed due to my opinion of the pasta sauce. Thankfully there are other shops in town with both better food and more pleasant owners.

Review: I'm going to try to keep this this brief. We ordered from them Friday night. Our order of ten wings came with eight. The pizza, was a "baked ziti pie" which sounded awesome because we love spaghetti pizza. With ordered a few extra toppings, and it actually looked "okay" when we got home. But here's the thing - the pasta was over-cooked, the pink sauce it was in was broken & grainy, and the remainder of the toppings had little to no flavor. The crust was not cut through and so tough that it was nearly inedible. 

I'd let this all go if the business had not decided to start volleying personal attacks suggesting we get COVID tests and totaling avoiding the fact they shorted our order. The restaurant uses a generic purveyor of frozen pizza ingredients, from dough to toppings (Lisanti - who basically distributes a turnkey, mass-produced, frozen, bland product). Their dough shows no evidence of being house-made. What they do show is a dogged approach to attacking anyone who does not like their products.

There are plenty of other options locally working from scratch. Campisi's & Zalat come to mind.

Review: When moving into a new area, finding a good New York pizza is as important to me as finding a good barber.  Having lived over 20 years in New York City and having eaten good NY pizza, I was thrilled to find great NY pizza in the area.  

The three of us ordered a 22-inch plain cheese pie and a cannoli to share. The cannoli was freshly filled so it retained the crispy shell.  The cream filling was not overly sweet and its overall consistency was very good. 

My wife and I agreed the pizza itself was the best NY pizza we've had since leaving NY about 25 years ago.  The slices were perfectly foldable, nicely crispy on the outside and the right amount of chewy inside.  The crust was not too salty and the sauce to cheese ratio was excellent.  As legitimate NY slices often do, these almost burned the roof of my mouth and a few drops of oil from the cheese fell on the paper plate.  The pie was huge so we took plenty of leftovers home. 

The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was spacious and super clean.  If you're looking for an authentic NY pizza, you won't be disappointed with Ferrari's.  Highly recommend!!

Review: If you want some of the best pizza of your life, get here...today! Seriously some of the best pizza we've ever had! We got the Bianca, Buffalo Chicken and pepperoni and all were phenomenal!

My sister said she will be coming back again, and I definitely will ask her to take me here when I come back to visit.

Review: Found this pizza place on yelp and decided to try. Did not disappoint!

That was the BEST pizza I have ever had in Dallas and I have lived here since 1995.

That crust is perfection with just the right balance of crispness, chew, & taste.
And the sauce is really flavorful!! Don't miss trying the Portobello pizza! 

Vinny was extremely helpful explaining all the options and Ferrari Favorites! 
5 stars all around!

Review: Run to Ferrari's if you are looking for some awesome NY style pizza. There are many spots around DFW that claim to have NY style pizza, but they are not it. This place does it right and it's probably because the owner and his family are all from NY. I'm a purist, so I always go for a regular/plain cheese slice and this place does not disappoint. I even took a whole pie home so I have lunch for the week!

My wife is a bit more adventurous and tries different things off the menu, which always is on point as well. This time she tried their chicken cutlet hero and she loved it!

We will frequent this place for as long as we live in this metroplex!

Review: Pizza and calzones have always been on point. They have some good speciality pizzas like the Buffalo Chicken pizza. 

The calzone was ~$11 with pepperoni. 

Some of the speciality pizzas can get a little pricey 

Staff was friendly and had plenty of space to sit down and eat while I assume it has a lot of takeout business.

Review: Closest thing to the NY style slice I've had here in Dallas. Love their grandma slice, chicken parm slice (specialty pie that comes out on Fridays) 

It's nestled in an ordinary little strip mall and easy to miss - seems like a neighborhood joint with lots of regulars. They have great pizza but if you go later like 7pm, you'll have limited choices and they dont seem to make fresh pies closer to closing which I understand. Do get their tiramisu, an absolute must!

Cashier service has always been courteous but never that friendly. Not a deal breaker for me but to some maybe.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Ferrari's Pizza has some of the best pizza. However, I have to give them 3 stars because their other food options were disappointing. The mozzarella sticks tasted like something you'd grab from a freezer aisle, and the calamari was a major letdown more batter than calamari, and we ended up throwing it out.
That said, we'll definitely continue visiting but will stick strictly to the pizza.If you're a pizza lover, this place is a must try. For anything else, I'd recommend passing.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Really pleased with this place. Service was friendly and the pizza was yummy. It's thin crust, large in size, and did not give me acid reflux. Always a win! The garlic knots and pizza rolls are ok. I'd just stick to the pizza next time. 

Still looking for the extra special pizza so that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I'll know when I taste it. Other than that, the pizza is good and is worth a try.

Review: Wow! Finally a great NY style pizza right here in Plano. After searching for this type of pizzeria for 2 years, we finally found Ferrari's Pizza, and it did not disappoint. They have a fantastic selection of pizzas, and the sizes are generous.

We ordered an 18" pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeno, and it was devoured by our family of four. The kids loved it, and the quality of the pizza was outstanding.

The service was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable for what you get. They also offer a good selection of alcohol, which is a nice bonus. We even met Vinny, the owner, who is a great guy from New York, adding an authentic touch to the whole experience.

We will definitely be back and highly recommend Ferrari's Pizza to anyone looking for an authentic NY pizza experience in Plano.

Review: Came over on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Not too busy and staff was friendly. Very good pizza, what I think of when I want New York style pizza. Thin, crisp crust with a tangy sauce and lots of cheese. Got a slice of cheese and the Grandma slice. Both were exceptional.

Can't wait to come back and try other menu items. Well done!

Review: When you hear Ferrari.... You think high end, world class, luxurious.
But for me it's just big pizza....
Nothing fancy, just big... pretty mediocre.
Service was pretty mediocre, though I will say I was only there to pick up my pizza.
I do plan to go back and dine in.
The place looks nice but just your standard small pizza place. 

Over all it's pretty forgettable 
I'd give it another try...
But I'm in no rush

Review: I ordered a pie for pick up... I was told this place was very "New York" but I had my doubts as "real" NYC pizza is hard to find in the DFW area. I was pleasantly surprised at the look of the pizza after unboxing. Flavor , sauce , cheese, foldability of the slice, and overall quality checked out. Will definitely be coming back. Fuggetabout stars, I give this place 5 out of 5 marons!

Review: I kept hearing such great things about this place figured I'd give them a try. Well I guess I caught them on a bad day there was only one girl working. Not sure if she is the usual pizza maker or not but she was doing it all herself. With that being said it definitely match the expectations. It wasn't bad but for $44 dollars I would have expected better from 2 14in pizzas.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: It was mediocre at best.  I placed my order online and arrived a few minutes prior to the expected ready time.    The counter guy was on the phone and took several minutes to take an order, then answered another call before getting to me.   That was several minutes.   My pizza was ready.  The pizza itself was warm, but not hot.   It had very little cheese or toppings.   For a $30.00 pizza it was very dissappointing.  Literally any of the chains would have been better at half the cost.  Go somewhere else.

Review: This is in a two way tie for my favorite pizza in the metroplex and I'm blessed that it is not far away. They get about as close as you can get to NYC pizza without having to catch a train and fight a few giant rats along the way. One taste and if you know, you know, you know?? 

Sometimes I can't talk the family into a whole pizza, which never lasts long anyway, and I'll stop by for a slice. My kids don't eat the crust, they didn't get that from my side. More for me. The crust has the chew you want. The sauce and cheese ratio, they nailed it. It tastes like they even have NYC tap water in the dough. Bolognese is fantastic. House sausage if you want a good slice, that's all you need. What more do I gotta say? It's a perfect slice.

Review: The ONLY actual NY-style pizza place nearby. Since moving from NY in 2021, I had given up on finding good pizza here.

The three of us ordered a 22-inch plain cheese pie and a cannoli to share. The cannoli was freshly filled so it retained the crispy shell.  The cream filling was not overly sweet and its overall consistency was very good. 

My wife and I agreed the pizza itself was the best NY pizza we've had since leaving NY about 25 years ago.  The slices were perfectly foldable, nicely crispy on the outside and the right amount of chewy inside.  The crust was not too salty and the sauce to cheese ratio was excellent.  As legitimate NY slices often do, these almost burned the roof of my mouth and a few drops of oil from the cheese fell on the paper plate.  The pie was huge so we took plenty of leftovers home. 

The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was spacious and super clean.  If you're looking for an authentic NY pizza, you won't be disappointed with Ferrari's.  Highly recommend!!

Review: If you want some of the best pizza of your life, get here...today! Seriously some of the best pizza we've ever had! We got the Bianca, Buffalo Chicken and pepperoni and all were phenomenal! Our friend from New York brought us and raves about it and now we know why! The staff is so sweet and such a great added perk to our visit!  We'll be back soon!

Review: Absolutely loved this place! Found this place when I was planning my trip for work/visiting my sister, and we were so glad I chose this place for lunch. On 3/24/24, we had mozzarella sticks and a large cheese pizza, and they were DELICIOUS! My sister said she will be coming back again, and I definitely will ask her to take me here when I come back to visit.

Review: I haven't lived near this place in over 10 years but I make the 30 minute drive and pass a million other pizza restaurants to go here specifically as often as I can. You're doing yourself a disservice if you pass them up.

Review: Found this pizza place on yelp and decided to try. Did not disappoint!

That was the BEST pizza I have ever had in Dallas and I have lived here since 1995.

That crust is perfection with just the right balance of crispness, chew, & taste.
And the sauce is really flavorful!! Don't miss trying the Portobello pizza! 

Vinny was extremely helpful explaining all the options and Ferrari Favorites! 
5 stars all around!

Review: Run to Ferrari's if you are looking for some awesome NY style pizza. There are many spots around DFW that claim to have NY style pizza, but they are not it. This place does it right and it's probably because the owner and his family are all from NY. I'm a purist, so I always go for a regular/plain cheese slice and this place does not disappoint. I even took a whole pie home so I have lunch for the week!

My wife is a bit more adventurous and tries different things off the menu, which always is on point as well. This time she tried their chicken cutlet hero and she loved it!

We will frequent this place for as long as we live in this metroplex!

Review: Excellent pizza and friendly service! I loved the grandma pie and their white pie was one of my favs. I also had the garlic knots and the marinara that came with them was very good. I'd probably try their pasta if I were to go again!

Review: Pizza and calzones have always been on point. They have some good speciality pizzas like the Buffalo Chicken pizza. 

The calzone was ~$11 with pepperoni. 

Some of the speciality pizzas can get a little pricey 

Staff was friendly and had plenty of space to sit down and eat while I assume it has a lot of takeout business.

Review: Closest thing to the NY style slice I've had here in Dallas. Love their grandma slice, chicken parm slice (specialty pie that comes out on Fridays) 

It's nestled in an ordinary little strip mall and easy to miss - seems like a neighborhood joint with lots of regulars. They have great pizza but if you go later like 7pm, you'll have limited choices and they dont seem to make fresh pies closer to closing which I understand. Do get their tiramisu, an absolute must!

Cashier service has always been courteous but never that friendly. Not a deal breaker for me but to some maybe.

Review: Ferrari's Pizza has some of the best pizza. However, I have to give them 3 stars because their other food options were disappointing. The mozzarella sticks tasted like something you'd grab from a freezer aisle, and the calamari was a major letdown more batter than calamari, and we ended up throwing it out.
That said, we'll definitely continue visiting but will stick strictly to the pizza.If you're a pizza lover, this place is a must try. For anything else, I'd recommend passing.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Really pleased with this place. Service was friendly and the pizza was yummy. It's thin crust, large in size, and did not give me acid reflux. Always a win! The garlic knots and pizza rolls are ok. I'd just stick to the pizza next time. 

Still looking for the extra special pizza so that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I'll know when I taste it. Other than that, the pizza is good and is worth a try.

Review: Wow! Finally a great NY style pizza right here in Plano. After searching for this type of pizzeria for 2 years, we finally found Ferrari's Pizza, and it did not disappoint. They have a fantastic selection of pizzas, and the sizes are generous.

We ordered an 18" pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeno, and it was devoured by our family of four. The kids loved it, and the quality of the pizza was outstanding.

The service was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable for what you get. They also offer a good selection of alcohol, which is a nice bonus. We even met Vinny, the owner, who is a great guy from New York, adding an authentic touch to the whole experience.

We will definitely be back and highly recommend Ferrari's Pizza to anyone looking for an authentic NY pizza experience in Plano.

Review: Came over on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Not too busy and staff was friendly. Very good pizza, what I think of when I want New York style pizza. Thin, crisp crust with a tangy sauce and lots of cheese. Got a slice of cheese and the Grandma slice. Both were exceptional.

Can't wait to come back and try other menu items. Well done!

Review: When you hear Ferrari.... You think high end, world class, luxurious.
But for me it's just big pizza....
Nothing fancy, just big... pretty mediocre.
Service was pretty mediocre, though I will say I was only there to pick up my pizza.
I do plan to go back and dine in.
The place looks nice but just your standard small pizza place. 

Over all it's pretty forgettable 
I'd give it another try...
But I'm in no rush

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I ordered a pie for pick up... I was told this place was very "New York" but I had my doubts as "real" NYC pizza is hard to find in the DFW area. I was pleasantly surprised at the look of the pizza after unboxing. Flavor , sauce , cheese, foldability of the slice, and overall quality checked out. Will definitely be coming back. Fuggetabout stars, I give this place 5 out of 5 marons!

Rating: 3 stars
Review: I kept hearing such great things about this place figured I'd give them a try. Well I guess I caught them on a bad day there was only one girl working. Not sure if she is the usual pizza maker or not but she was doing it all herself. With that being said it definitely match the expectations. It wasn't bad but for $44 dollars I would have expected better from 2 14in pizzas.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: It was mediocre at best.  I placed my order online and arrived a few minutes prior to the expected ready time.    The counter guy was on the phone and took several minutes to take an order, then answered another call before getting to me.   That was several minutes.   My pizza was ready.  The pizza itself was warm, but not hot.   It had very little cheese or toppings.   For a $30.00 pizza it was very dissappointing.  Literally any of the chains would have been better at half the cost.  Go somewhere else.

Review: This is in a two way tie for my favorite pizza in the metroplex and I'm blessed that it is not far away. They get about as close as you can get to NYC pizza without having to catch a train and fight a few giant rats along the way. One taste and if you know, you know, you know?? 

Sometimes I can't talk the family into a whole pizza, which never lasts long anyway, and I'll stop by for a slice. My kids don't eat the crust, they didn't get that from my side. More for me. The crust has the chew you want. The sauce and cheese ratio, they nailed it. It tastes like they even have NYC tap water in the dough. Bolognese is fantastic. House sausage if you want a good slice, that's all you need. What more do I gotta say? It's a perfect slice.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: The ONLY actual NY-style pizza place nearby. Since moving from NY in 2021, I had given up on finding good pizza here. Luckily, Ferrari's was 5 min from one of my errands so I decided to stop by - so glad I did! I got a plain slice (I cried happy tears as I folded the slice, New Yorker style) and a delicious grandma slice (I've never even heard that word here).

Wish it was closer to my house!

Review: I wouldn't have written a review about the stale dry pizza and bread, empty ice machine, broken bathroom latch or disjointed service where my wife didn't get her sandwich until the other 7 in our party of 8 were finished eating.  But when the owner loudly says to my wife "Way to make a scene" for simply asking about her sandwich after everyone else in our party is finished eating, I feel like I should let others know.  When I ask him why he is making a scene when all she did was ask for her meal and he tells me this is a counter service place, as if that means they don't have to care about service or their customer, I need to write a review.  (Others in our party had orders that were cooked and not simply reheated and their food was also served and eaten before my wife's ever came out.)  I asked him not to talk to my wife that way and he asked me "what are you gonna do?"   So if I can't beat up the owner then he can talk to my wife (and you) however he wants.  Yes, when that happens I need to let others know.  When he then announces to the restaurant my wife is high maintenance I need to write a review.  One look at this "restaurant" will tell you the owner is no authority on "maintenance."

Don't waste your time or money on this "restaurant" or its angry owner.  Maintenance is low, food quality lower and the service and pride in ownership is embarrassing and downright shameful.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: Staff is great, friendly, courteous, and helpful. Ambience is nice. Food is good, not great for the price.

Last time we got a whole Sicilian pie, we had a reheat it and cook it for quite a while before it was actually "done", and not a bunch of uncooked dough. And for the amount we paid for it, the topping seemed really sparse.

Review: Been coming here for years! Actually we order it once a week. Hands down the best pizza in DFW. Full stop. And believe me we've tried a lot of pizza since we've moved here from Miami! It's a perfect New York style pizza with a thick crust on the end and then thin the rest of the way just as it should be. Absolute perfection! 

Just go, it's great pizza! :)

Review: 1 star is waaaaaaay too high for this place.  Last time I checked customer service is a thing.  From the moment we walked in the guy at the register was rude.  We didn't get menus, were not even greeted, and had no idea if we were to order at the register or if they came to the table.  When I asked this guy...he seemed put out and had an attitude.  I thought it was just me but the customer behind me asked if he was being snarky to me.  This was our first time AND LAST time we will eat here.
None of the food came out together which I understand.  Most of us were finished eating when the last meal came out.  When we inquired about it this guy started accusing us of "making a scene" and being "high maintenance".  He also said since they are counter service they don't have to worry about customer service.  

The food was barely Meh and then the service...save yourself don't eat here!

Review: I went on a Saturday and was not disappointed. The restaurant is clean, nice radio station. We were greeted by a friendly counter person, and the available pies, which looked amazing. The house pie is front and center cheese and sauce. Add topping to your slice, and they bring it out to your table. We went with sauce and cheese, and it was terrific. The crust is worth up to a 50-mile travel. So, let's say it's a 50-mile crust--crisp, flavorful, and perfect color.

Review: Food- Had their house size pizza which is amazing! Reminded my wife of the pizza she used to eat back in the east coast. Massive pie, delicious sauce, just enough cheese, and a really thin crust. 

Service - I picked up the pizza but the staff was so kind! Had two kids with me and one of those is a baby who needed to be held. The team on site recognized my struggle and insisted on taking the pie to my car while I held the baby and my other child. Such a nice gesture which you don't often see these days. Thank you!

Very happy about the food and the service. We'll definitely be back!

Review: Quiet, kinda small place but I always get pizza for takeout so it's fine. Pizza here is amazing, you can tell that it's homemade as they take 10-20 mins to make each pizza. I always order the Mediterranean Pie (pesto and alfredo sauce, sundried tomatoes, feta and mozzarella) and it's so delicious. I've also order the Alfredo which was also pretty good.

Review: This Pizza place when I went in was an owner operated restaurant. Love was put into their food. For a Texas pizza place it was a hit and good quality. New York style pizza. I had better in New York but if you live here you want to go. The meatballs and sauce impressed me and were very good and I would highly recommend them. The ambience and seating was a closet small feeling. Service was fine. More or less I would return.

Review: Found this Italian owned pizzeria by accident tonight while heading back to Northern Collin County. The place was clean, had great service, and I will return when I am in the area. 

We ordered the largest meat pizza they had for a party of 5 including two hungry teenage boys after their football game. They devoured the pie. 

The toppings were flavorful. The sauce was delicious. The crust was thin and perfect. 

Unfortunately the pie was finished before we could even get a picture, but the pics others have posted are accurate. 

I recommend their thin crust pizza over any others in the area. Go try them out! You won't regret it. 

Ciao.

Review: It says pizza right in the name so maybe I should have gotten the pizza. But I wanted pasta and they had it so I ordered it. And it was not great.

I ordered the carbonara which came with a white sauce. I would guess it's Alfredo sauce but guessing is all you can do because the flavor was absent. It was a bit soupy and was so nothing that I added ketchup when I got home and I'm not even kidding. If this is typical of the pasta sauce I would say maybe they should take it off the menu.

That said, the peas and prosciutto were flavorful and perfect. So it's an easy enough thing to fix if they are motivated to do so. [Edit: They do not seem motivated to do so.] I will skip revisit since the owner said on Yelp that I'm not welcomed due to my opinion of the pasta sauce. Thankfully there are other shops in town with both better food and more pleasant owners.

Review: I'm a New Yorker born and raised 40 years before moving down to Texas and when I tell you this Owner is truly a native New Yorker with New York style pizza from the aroma, to the perfection on the crust...  drove from Dallas and worth the drive and won't be the last trip. Service is on point and the place is clean to perfection.

Review: We've been searching several years for good New York style pizza. This place had been recommended several times in a Facebook foodie group.  We're glad we finally had a chance to stop in. The pizza was delicious. We'll definitely be back to try more pies!

Review: I'm going to try to keep this this brief. We ordered from them Friday night. Our order of ten wings came with eight. The pizza, was a "baked ziti pie" which sounded awesome because we love spaghetti pizza. With ordered a few extra toppings, and it actually looked "okay" when we got home. But here's the thing - the pasta was over-cooked, the pink sauce it was in was broken & grainy, and the remainder of the toppings had little to no flavor. The crust was not cut through and so tough that it was nearly inedible. 

I'd let this all go if the business had not decided to start volleying personal attacks suggesting we get COVID tests and totaling avoiding the fact they shorted our order. The restaurant uses a generic purveyor of frozen pizza ingredients, from dough to toppings (Lisanti - who basically distributes a turnkey, mass-produced, frozen, bland product). Their dough shows no evidence of being house-made. What they do show is a dogged approach to attacking anyone who does not like their products.

There are plenty of other options locally working from scratch. Campisi's & Zalat come to mind.
