Review: Amazing. Beautifully well-thought out food. Drink menu is also quite unique and impressive. Every single thing we had was delicious. Felt taken care of by a team of staff rather than just one server. 
FINALLY some food culture coming to Dallas. We need more of this, please!
Cannot wait to go back!

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

Review: Rye has been on our Dallas bucket list for quite some time and I am so thrilled that we finally got to experience it! The restaurant was fantastic from food to service with my only critique being the bathroom doors are glass, (I'm not sure why anyone would make that choice). 

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place! 

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy. It was not very busy the Thursday night we went and service was speedy. The cocktail and a la carte food menu was fairly limited and didn't catch my eye, but overall was a good experience

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

Review: I want to shout out my bartender, Julian. He is the best bartender I've ever had and i drink a lot. Julian makes his drink with his customer in mind. I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: I came out for my birthday and the visit did not disappoint! My first time visiting Rye was in the summer for their Aguasal menu they had temporarily. We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: 10/10 everything, service drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to be back to try the chef's choice 11 course meal. We stopped in for a quick bite and the only thing I didn't get a picture of was the hot dog that was also delicious.

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: Came to Rye after seeing that their cocktail program won the Michelin star and it did not disappoint. Julian was very knowledgeable and approachable which is always appreciated. 

We enjoyed the following cocktails and would recommend- 
- Rye's boulevardier 
- Private barrel toranto

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

Review: Went for happy hour. It was our second time there in a while and we always like the vibes of Rye.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place! 

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy. It was not very busy the Thursday night we went and service was speedy. The cocktail and a la carte food menu was fairly limited and didn't catch my eye, but overall was a good experience

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

Review: I want to shout out my bartender, Julian. He is the best bartender I've ever had and i drink a lot. Julian makes his drink with his customer in mind. I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: I came out for my birthday and the visit did not disappoint! My first time visiting Rye was in the summer for their Aguasal menu they had temporarily. We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: 10/10 everything, service drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to be back to try the chef's choice 11 course meal. We stopped in for a quick bite and the only thing I didn't get a picture of was the hot dog that was also delicious.

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: Came to Rye after seeing that their cocktail program won the Michelin star and it did not disappoint. Julian was very knowledgeable and approachable which is always appreciated. 

We enjoyed the following cocktails and would recommend- 
- Rye's boulevardier 
- Private barrel toranto

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

Review: Went for happy hour. It was our second time there in a while and we always like the vibes of Rye.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy. It was not very busy the Thursday night we went and service was speedy. The cocktail and a la carte food menu was fairly limited and didn't catch my eye, but overall was a good experience

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

Review: I want to shout out my bartender, Julian. He is the best bartender I've ever had and i drink a lot. Julian makes his drink with his customer in mind. I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: I came out for my birthday and the visit did not disappoint! My first time visiting Rye was in the summer for their Aguasal menu they had temporarily. We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: 10/10 everything, service drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to be back to try the chef's choice 11 course meal. We stopped in for a quick bite and the only thing I didn't get a picture of was the hot dog that was also delicious.

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: Came to Rye after seeing that their cocktail program won the Michelin star and it did not disappoint. Julian was very knowledgeable and approachable which is always appreciated. 

We enjoyed the following cocktails and would recommend- 
- Rye's boulevardier 
- Private barrel toranto

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

Review: Went for happy hour. It was our second time there in a while and we always like the vibes of Rye.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

Review: Rye has been on our Dallas bucket list for quite some time and I am so thrilled that we finally got to experience it! The restaurant was fantastic from food to service with my only critique being the bathroom doors are glass, (I'm not sure why anyone would make that choice). 

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place!

I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: I came out for my birthday and the visit did not disappoint! My first time visiting Rye was in the summer for their Aguasal menu they had temporarily. We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: 10/10 everything, service drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to be back to try the chef's choice 11 course meal. We stopped in for a quick bite and the only thing I didn't get a picture of was the hot dog that was also delicious.

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: Came to Rye after seeing that their cocktail program won the Michelin star and it did not disappoint. Julian was very knowledgeable and approachable which is always appreciated. 

We enjoyed the following cocktails and would recommend- 
- Rye's boulevardier 
- Private barrel toranto

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

Review: Went for happy hour. It was our second time there in a while and we always like the vibes of Rye.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

Review: Rye has been on our Dallas bucket list for quite some time and I am so thrilled that we finally got to experience it! The restaurant was fantastic from food to service with my only critique being the bathroom doors are glass, (I'm not sure why anyone would make that choice). 

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place! 

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy.

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: 10/10 everything, service drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to be back to try the chef's choice 11 course meal. We stopped in for a quick bite and the only thing I didn't get a picture of was the hot dog that was also delicious.

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: Came to Rye after seeing that their cocktail program won the Michelin star and it did not disappoint. Julian was very knowledgeable and approachable which is always appreciated. 

We enjoyed the following cocktails and would recommend- 
- Rye's boulevardier 
- Private barrel toranto

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

Review: Went for happy hour. It was our second time there in a while and we always like the vibes of Rye.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out. There's not a single gotcha or negative comment to make. The cocktails are unique, the staff is incredible, the vibe is cool, and I will definitely come back to bring my husband.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: Ambiance it's amazing! The bartenders are so attentive. Great place for cocktails and shareables. 
FYI appetizers are very tiny. Just order the dinner plates and share instead of appetizers. 

Pork lollipops were so so delicious!!

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

Review: Rye has been on our Dallas bucket list for quite some time and I am so thrilled that we finally got to experience it! The restaurant was fantastic from food to service with my only critique being the bathroom doors are glass, (I'm not sure why anyone would make that choice). 

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place! 

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy.

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

Review: I want to shout out my bartender, Julian. He is the best bartender I've ever had and i drink a lot. Julian makes his drink with his customer in mind. I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: Came to Rye after seeing that their cocktail program won the Michelin star and it did not disappoint. Julian was very knowledgeable and approachable which is always appreciated. 

We enjoyed the following cocktails and would recommend- 
- Rye's boulevardier 
- Private barrel toranto

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

Review: Went for happy hour. It was our second time there in a while and we always like the vibes of Rye.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out. There's not a single gotcha or negative comment to make. The cocktails are unique, the staff is incredible, the vibe is cool, and I will definitely come back to bring my husband.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: Ambiance it's amazing! The bartenders are so attentive. Great place for cocktails and shareables. 
FYI appetizers are very tiny. Just order the dinner plates and share instead of appetizers.

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

Review: Rye has been on our Dallas bucket list for quite some time and I am so thrilled that we finally got to experience it! The restaurant was fantastic from food to service with my only critique being the bathroom doors are glass, (I'm not sure why anyone would make that choice). 

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place! 

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy.

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

Review: I want to shout out my bartender, Julian. He is the best bartender I've ever had and i drink a lot. Julian makes his drink with his customer in mind. I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: I came out for my birthday and the visit did not disappoint! My first time visiting Rye was in the summer for their Aguasal menu they had temporarily. We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

Review: Went for happy hour. It was our second time there in a while and we always like the vibes of Rye.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out. There's not a single gotcha or negative comment to make. The cocktails are unique, the staff is incredible, the vibe is cool, and I will definitely come back to bring my husband.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: Ambiance it's amazing! The bartenders are so attentive. Great place for cocktails and shareables. 
FYI appetizers are very tiny. Just order the dinner plates and share instead of appetizers. 

Pork lollipops were so so delicious!!

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

Review: Rye has been on our Dallas bucket list for quite some time and I am so thrilled that we finally got to experience it! The restaurant was fantastic from food to service with my only critique being the bathroom doors are glass, (I'm not sure why anyone would make that choice). 

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place! 

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy.

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

Review: I want to shout out my bartender, Julian. He is the best bartender I've ever had and i drink a lot. Julian makes his drink with his customer in mind. I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: I came out for my birthday and the visit did not disappoint! My first time visiting Rye was in the summer for their Aguasal menu they had temporarily. We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: 10/10 everything, service drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to be back to try the chef's choice 11 course meal. We stopped in for a quick bite and the only thing I didn't get a picture of was the hot dog that was also delicious.

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

Review: Went for happy hour. It was our second time there in a while and we always like the vibes of Rye.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out. There's not a single gotcha or negative comment to make. The cocktails are unique, the staff is incredible, the vibe is cool, and I will definitely come back to bring my husband.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: Ambiance it's amazing! The bartenders are so attentive. Great place for cocktails and shareables. 
FYI appetizers are very tiny. Just order the dinner plates and share instead of appetizers. 

Pork lollipops were so so delicious!!

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

Review: Rye has been on our Dallas bucket list for quite some time and I am so thrilled that we finally got to experience it! The restaurant was fantastic from food to service with my only critique being the bathroom doors are glass, (I'm not sure why anyone would make that choice). 

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place! 

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy.

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

Review: I want to shout out my bartender, Julian. He is the best bartender I've ever had and i drink a lot. Julian makes his drink with his customer in mind. I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: I came out for my birthday and the visit did not disappoint! My first time visiting Rye was in the summer for their Aguasal menu they had temporarily. We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: 10/10 everything, service drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to be back to try the chef's choice 11 course meal. We stopped in for a quick bite and the only thing I didn't get a picture of was the hot dog that was also delicious.

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Shame to see to that their amazing espresso martini is no longer on happy hour menu, but their old fashioned is quit good as well.

We opted to get everything on the happy hour menu.

The Icelandic hotdog was exquisite and the best thing on the HH menu.
Pork belly taco - great.
Fry bread - ok the bread was fine, but I have a sensitive nose so I thought there cheese or butter it came with smelled like a wet towel. That said my wife said it was good, so maybe I don't know anything lol.
Classic burger - I remembered this being good last time, but it wasn't great. I thought the bread was a little dry and the meat was overdone. Wouldn't get this again.
Fried mushroom - this was delicious.
Chicken taco special - this one was super spicy and I think they overdone it on certain ingredient. Maybe paprika? Didn't like it.

While the food was mixed, the HH is a great value, great drinks and great vibe. Service was friendly and quick too.

Review: I've been Rye several times and have been consistently impressed .The first time I went, I had a few items from their a la carte menu, and appreciated the quality of the dishes. They also had a nice wine list that I was not able to delve into. 

The second time was for brunch with friends for my birthday. Champagne and caviar was a great way to celebrate, and I was very pleased with the variety and quality of sparkling wines available. I was also impressed with the kind, casual, and friendly service we received. This would be a the same on my latest visit. I was not, however, that impressed by the Icelandic Hot Dog. This seemed more gimmick than good.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: Definitely pricey but good for a bougie dinner! Got the tacos and was definitely one of the entrees that was worth it. Also literally will crave the espresso martini!

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out. There's not a single gotcha or negative comment to make. The cocktails are unique, the staff is incredible, the vibe is cool, and I will definitely come back to bring my husband.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: We loved Rye! Excellent food and the service was phenomenal too. Honestly so good we completely forgot to take more pics! Will definitely be back.

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: Ambiance it's amazing! The bartenders are so attentive. Great place for cocktails and shareables. 
FYI appetizers are very tiny. Just order the dinner plates and share instead of appetizers. 

Pork lollipops were so so delicious!!

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Incredible restaurant experience from start to finish of our meal. The service in amazing--very knowledgeable staff and considerate.

Review: Rye offers such an elevated culinary experience with its creative tapas-style menu. The dishes have amazing bold flavors and you can tell they put lot of thought behind how each meal is presented. The cocktails are fresh and delicious. The Cacio e Pepe is rich and creamy, the cheek pun tacos, which the staff highly recommended, are mouthwatering! The brisket is so tender and full of flavor, they're a must-try. For dessert, the cheesecake was incredible. It came with these amazing cheddar cake crumbles on the side that I just couldn't get enough of. I kind of wish they were their own dessert cause they were that good!

The service really made the experience, too. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy, dimly lit vibe of the place made it feel intimate and relaxed, perfect for enjoying great food and drinks. Rye definitely knows how to make a meal feel like a memorable experience.

Review: Rye has been on our Dallas bucket list for quite some time and I am so thrilled that we finally got to experience it! The restaurant was fantastic from food to service with my only critique being the bathroom doors are glass, (I'm not sure why anyone would make that choice). 

My husband and I both started the meal with cocktails and a cheese board. I had their whiskey sour which was authentically made with egg white, a very rare find and it was spectacular! The cheese board was also very good with the house made challah and crackers being the high note of the dish. 

For our mains we had the Cacio e Pepe and the Pork Belly Lollipops both of which were very good although if I were to go back I would get the Pork Belly again and forgo the pasta as the very thin noodles made it difficult to eat. 

Lastly, we ended dinner with the espresso cake and cheesecake both of which were good but I would give the espresso cake an 8/10, slightly dry, and the cheesecake an 11/10 as it was the most perfect balance of flavor and texture. 

For a night out it is well worth it and I very much recommend!

Review: Rye is a fun, creative spot with a constantly evolving menu of inventive small plates. One of the standout dishes is the Cornucopia, a playful celebration of corn in five different forms, including ice cream! It's a mix of flavors and textures that's both clever and delicious. The cozy, modern vibe makes it a great place to try something new, and with their seasonal menu, there's always a reason to come back. If you're up for a unique dining experience, Rye is definitely worth a visit. Such a cool vibe and ambiance in this place! 

One of the owners, Tanner, also made it a point to walk to each table that night and get to know everyone individually. We mentioned we had reservations for Apothecary after dinner, and he was kind enough to walk us there through the kitchen, with a full tour of how the magic happens! 

You can tell lots of love and passion is put into these places, and it really resonates with those that appreciate the details!

Review: Came here to celebrate a whiskey enthusiast's birthday--there was an impressive whiskey list. We got two flights but did not try the food or speakeasy.

Review: While I can't say that this place is for me, I can say that I had an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. It seems like the menus regularly change and I wasn't sure that I would enjoy any of their offerings this night. I ended getting the Rabbit Chorizo short rib. The rib was tender and seasoned well, but the cornbread stuffing that came with it was the true front runner.

All around, the service was exceptional, but I am not excited to come back for dinner. Their brunch menu looks promising, however.

Review: I want to shout out my bartender, Julian. He is the best bartender I've ever had and i drink a lot. Julian makes his drink with his customer in mind. I thought that Espresso Martini was nasty and people were just lying about it but when JULIAN made me an espresso martini, it was the best one I've ever had and I've had 5 different espresso martinis at 5 diff bars and they were nasty asf which is why i thought EMs were a scam. He effectively changed my stance on them. I had the wake and bake + the calvados and pear  and idk how to explain just how delicious those drinks were. You can taste the care that is put into his drinks. I don't think I've tasted a bartender who loved his craft in a long time so tasting Julian's drinks were a breath of fresh air. I can taste the effort and care he puts into his drinks. He atmosphere and ambiance was so relaxed and comforting but earthy. It's like a coffee shop but with alcoholic drinks. 12/10 , i will always recommend !

Review: Rye was a pleasant experience. I loved the green ambiance and the dim lighting that sets a great mood for gatherings and dates. Our waiter was kind and was attentive with recommending me special. I got the Cacio E Pepe. I loved the crunchy bit of onion on top and the sauce that wasn't too thick like other places would do. I also ordered the braised meat which was on the dry side and left a bland taste in my mouth. However, that was the only disappointing thing. The Icelandic Hotdog was surprisingly delicious! The bread that the hotdog lied on and the sweet and tangy flavors paired together well. Overall, 7.5/10

Review: I came out for my birthday and the visit did not disappoint! My first time visiting Rye was in the summer for their Aguasal menu they had temporarily. We loved everything about it and although we knew the menu was leaving, the chef wasn't so we had to come back and try them again! The service was spot on! From entry to exit! Booking a reservation was super simple as well. There was 10 of us and at first my friends did not see much they wanted to order. The menu is something they aren't used to. With some guidance, they were able to order and loved their picks! I had the vegetarian tasting and it was amazing! I would literally go back to get it again! The ambience was great with the dim lighting and table lamps. It was perfect! The curry, corn-u-copia, zartartare, and taco were my faves but I enjoyed them all!

Review: 10/10 everything, service drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to be back to try the chef's choice 11 course meal. We stopped in for a quick bite and the only thing I didn't get a picture of was the hot dog that was also delicious.

Review: This place is a staple for my partner and I! With the best service comes a great experience and with the most divine entrées comes happy customers/guests! 

The ambience is very elusive, low lighting, and fabulous low toned music to really set a semi New York/ classy French vibe. That's at least what I feel when I'm here! Reminds me of a high class, quaint yet classy place in New York City that you'd have to hear about, not just stumble upon (I say this about Rye and apothecary)! 

Tanner is awesome and always makes sure to say hello every time I come in! He definitely makes the place even more enjoyable- which seems close to impossible considering how much I already enjoy it. 

The food is divine, the drinks are succulent and robust and I always leave happy. The bathrooms are always prim and neat and smell fantastic and the hostess greets with gentleness and kindness making the automatic walk in, pleasurable and up-to-par. 

Can't wait to be back in a place that reminds me of my fathers dining area or traveling in a busy bright city. (might even go tonight) 
Thanks so much for the incredible food, drinks and atmosphere Rye and Apothecary!

Review: I was very impressed by this place, a small cozy ambience of romance built in such impactful and thoughtful flavors. The group that I was with ate the tasting menu, which was so worth it. There were two vegan options that you would've never have known did not have meat a one bite experience filled with immaculate And thoughtful flavors from around the world and from personal experiences, they were able to accommodate food, allergies, and food preferences within the tasting menu. We also spoke to the owners and head chefs. They were so kind after the tasting we were gifted the experience of going into the kitchen and talking With the chefs of course this place was given Michelin star awards for their cocktails, such as the lychee drink I will definitely be back. They also have valet if you need it highly recommend!

Review: I have been here twice but the first go round, I wasn't able to try out the food. This day, I had the privilege of checking them out was during restaurant week. Although some of the items aren't or won't be readily available due to the pop up Aquasal Salt & Water. (They are working on something currently) I still recommend you giving this place a try for the ambiance, service, great drinks and friendliness of the staff. 

As for Aquasal, they prepared dishes from Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Venezuela and Jamaica. For starters, me and my friend tried the jerk wings and coconut cheese. The coconut cheese was fantastic! The jerk wings were a bit too chewy. For the entree, we both had arepjitas (think arepas and fajitas fused together) I had the steak with chimichurri 
and my friend had chicken. The dish was full of flavor and was enough to take home. I enjoyed every bite. For dessert, key lime cheesecake. Small yet delicious. 

Definitely check out Rye for a night out with friends, drinks, or to grab some tapas. I'm certain you will enjoy the spot and there is their speakeasy right next door.

Review: My husband wasn't thrilled about having to drive to dinner while we were in Dallas, but once he saw the food he didn't mind it. 

We were looking for a unique experience with creative food items you can't  just find anywhere. My husband loves corn so I knew he was going to order this dish with 5 different types of corn in it. I forget what it was called but it was a seasonal item and was delicious. The duroc pork belly lollipops were awesome too. I got some kind of crab pasta that was layered like lasagna. It was good but I definitely think I liked the small plates we had better. I would recommend getting a bunch of small plates to share. The sauerkraut cake was interesting but tasty too. 

We ordered a bunch of small plates also. We were arguing over whether to split 1 or order 2 of this Icelandic hotdogs so we could each have our own. I knew it was going to be fantastic and wanted my own but my husband said it was stupid to order 2 when we could order other items Instead. We ordered 1 to split and I kinda wanted more but we got the mushroom bites too and they were good too. I liked the atmosphere of the place it had like an outdoor garden rustic kind of feel to it. 

All the cocktails were creative and great  as well. We got a few at Rye and then went Nextdoor to their sister restaurant to get more drinks. 

This was probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip to Texas, I definitely recommend it.

After that experience, I returned with my wife and another couple and had Rye's Chef's Tasting Menu. Rye set a high bar for itself since the reservation was an eyepopping $250.00 per person ($180.00 reservation plus prepaid tip/service fees). Luckily for everyone, they did not disappoint. 

I was a little unsure of the "drink pairing" as I am used to usually only having wine pairings. But this was an amazing concept and experience. In addition to some fine wines and port, they served sake and some amazing cocktails. 

The food was all delicately served and tasted great. Many of the dishes had the kind of "wow!" factor you want to have with a fine dining experience, such as the amuse bouches that included kangaroo. Several were also playfully served, which is always fun. 

I can easily see Rye earning a Michelin Star and hope it does now that Michelin is (finally) rating Texas. I do not expect it will earn a second, as the service, while friendly, careful, and attentive, is not at the extreme level required for a second. The food is also not universally astounding, even though many of the dishes are.

If you enjoy fine dining and are in Dallas, Rye is a must try.

Review: Overall stellar place. Cool, sleek ambiance. The food was distinct, and a little pricey, but expected in an upscale place. There was no birthday special deal, but the waiter worked hard to make the cake we ordered special. The service was nice. Just be cautious of the parking, it can be hard to find parking in the area.

Review: Definitely pricey but good for a bougie dinner! Got the tacos and was definitely one of the entrees that was worth it. Also literally will crave the espresso martini!

Review: The chef's tasting dinner was excellent. However, I wouldn't recommend the cocktail/wine pairing as it was very underwhelming. There was only one cocktail in the mix and it was a basic cherry vodka spritzer. It would have been better to order our own specialty cocktails. I thought the cocktail pairing would be worth it because of the Michelin cocktail award.

Review: Decided to check this place out as the menu looked interesting and based on other reviews, the ambience appeared to be good as well. However, there was nothing that really popped out to me. The food was fairly bland and nothing special. The octopus hummus was probably the best thing we had. The coffee was good. 

I will say that our server was beyond sweet and attentive which is why I cannot give this place a lower rating.

Review: Rye has converted into AquaSol for the summer. Beach vibe. New food and menu. We had dinner for 4 on a Friday night and loved it. They have a fusion dish called Arepitas or something like that, which  has the dough from arepas and the self assembly of fajitas. Various protein choices, steak and shrimp are great. Great cocktails and wines. Check it out this summer. In the fall the old Rye returns

Review: Food was extraordinary!  And Daegan was our server, full of brilliant advice and suggestions on how much to order, though he was not familiar with the cooking techniques employed by the chef.  Thankfully there were two other servers who seem to have been read into the gastronomy.  Overall the dessert course was the only disappointment of the evening, the Cornucopia was delightful with corn prepared in five different ways.
I'd say to sum the experience up, it's a molecular gastronomy type spot, I imagine it's a bit like ElBulli was in Northern Spain.

Review: Great place for a casual group dinner, the menu is tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. 

The portions looked small but they were super filling! We shared 4 tapas and 2 desserts between 4 people and we were stuffed! 

They have a great drink selection, I had the coconut tiki drink which was refreshing and rich. 

For starters we had the octopus hummus and Filipino tacos. Then we had the Casio de Pepe and cornucopia to finish. Everything was delicious! The tacos were my favorite. 

Will our server was very accommodating, answered all of our questions and recommended some of the funkier desserts on the menu that sounded weird but we're actually delicious. 

We got the sauerkraut chocolate cake & the chocolate habanero donuts.

Review: My friends and I paid a visit to Rye and ordered  a little bit of everything from the menu to try. The stand outs were cheek y pun tacos-- super soft cheek meat paired with a crispy flakey taco, short rib-- hearty rib pair with a rich sauce, and duroc pork belly lollipop-- super soft pork belly that melts in your mouth paired with some bright rainbow chard. All the cocktails were also well balanced and delectable.  

The restaurant was intimately decorated. Staff were knowledgable of each dish and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great unique dining experience.

Review: Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Dallas- service is always amazing, the menu is playful and rotates seasonally. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the fried halloumi with grapefruit and Fresno chili honey. The food you eat here is simply not food you can eat anywhere else. Great vegan options, intimate, warm and cozy atmosphere. Not terribly hard to get into if you don't have a reservation. I cannot recommend Rye enough, it is a must try for anyone in Dallas.

Review: The best dinner I've ever had. We hosted a corporate event here and did the tasting menu with premium drink menu. Every detail of the meal is so well thought out. There's not a single gotcha or negative comment to make. The cocktails are unique, the staff is incredible, the vibe is cool, and I will definitely come back to bring my husband.

Review: Great food, tapas portions great bourbon selection. It sounds odd, but the hot dog is one of the best things on the menu.  Oysters are excellent along with tacos. Great tasting flights of Bourbon. Wait staff and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.  Funky vibe, great for dates and for groups.

Review: The food was amazing!  My husband and I opted for the tasting menu.  We have done a few tasting menus in Chicago.  We have searched for good-tasting menus in Dallas (besides sushi) and there are not many options at all.  So we were excited to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  The food was creative and delicious.  My husband doesn't like rye or fennel and both were on the menu.  He loved it! The service was great.  The head chef came by the table and introduced himself.  We got to go back into the kitchen to meet the kitchen staff.  It was a fun experience.

Review: Nothing to call home about everything was sufficient, but my food was cold when it came out and the presentation a bit messy. The service was passable. I have a bad habit of not checking my receipts, but it was brought to my attention that they add a fee for the employees insurance to checks which is a bit off putting in my opinion. I don't need to go back, but I suppose that detail is fair to note for others.

Review: Dropped by for an early Sunday dinner (girl's night out!) last month and ordered a bunch of things off the dinner menu to try! Service was excellent despite a few hiccups here and there (very sad the halloumi dish was sold out when we ordered it, I'll have to come back and try it in the future), and we all enjoyed the drinks we ordered. We had a 2-year-old with us as well and staff were super accommodating of her needs.

As for the food, there were some standouts and a couple of duds. Our favorites of the night were probably the Icelandic hot dog (so tasty, and all the textures and flavors meld so well together), the pork belly and filipino tacos we ordered off the happy hour menu (so nice that HH is available all week, not just on the weekdays!), and most of the vegetable-heavy dishes. In general Rye is amazing with veggies, and it turned this beet-hater into a beet-lover for the roasted vegetable dish. Fried mushrooms were perfect and came with an excellent dipping sauce. I did wish the oct-ummus came with a bit of something to dip into the extra hummus that remained on the plate after we finished eating the octopus, but maybe we just needed to get more fry bread (which was also a big hit with the baby).

The duds mostly came later; the cacio e pepe was just alright - IMO it suffered from such a thin pasta used - and the Ursula lasagna was way too salty for everyone, even me (usually someone who doesn't mind a heavier hand with salt). At the end of the night there were a few food and drink items we ordered off the HH menu that weren't counted as such, but that was easily remedied when we spoke to our main server for the night (who I also believe happened to be the head chef). In any case, this place is one of my husband's favorites in the metroplex so I am sure we'll be back - I hope we get to try the halloumi citrus dish, and maybe Rye will turn this chocolate hater into a lover with their sauerkraut cake, which wasn't intriguing to enough people on this particular outing to order. I do also hope the McKinney location is back up and running soon, it's much closer to where we live and we'd love the excuse to visit more often.

Review: Came here since we were in the area and Apothecary was closed for a private event. I tried the drink at the end of the menu with a long name, something like 'dodge, dash...' and the seasonal frozen drink (a mule). My husband had the highball rye which was delicious and perfect. I didn't love either of my drinks, but would try this place again. The mule was heavy on the ginger, and the drink with the long name was like a slightly bitter coke.

Review: I've always walked by this place and never tried it out and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not doing so earlier. Went here for happy hour and food, service, and ambiance was great! I got the wagyu burger and it was divine. Do take into account that they do NOT have ranch and will have a small charge on the tab that supports the employee benefits (for the quality and service I got, I didn't even mind). I would come back as everyone was awesome. It was a bit cold as I went here during the winter and I wished they kept the door closed.

Review: Incredible dinner! Every. Single. Thing. Was delicious! If I had to go back and only get one appetizer and entrée I wouldn't miss the Icelandic hotdog and pork belly lollipops! Although, the cabbage and filet were phenomenal! 
We also got the sauerkraut cake and it was amazing!

Review: Just had our first visit to Rye- what a fabulous experience! Welcomed like family, served like royalty, treated like friends- the food was exceptional- the most interesting combinations were flavor bombs in your mouth. The ambiance was warm and welcoming- part family room, part steam punk speakeasy. The service was wonderful- not hurried and not slow- perfection. This is a night we'll be talking about for awhile!  At least until next time. This is a real gem on lowest Greenville. I'm eager to go back!

Review: Rye is foodie heaven in a relaxed non-pretentious environment. Came to Rye for my birthday dinner & absolutely loved it! My boyfriend who is not as adventurous of an eater as I ended up pleasantly surprised and loved every dish we got. 

Rye is a tapas style restaurant with small plates meant to be shared to experience different tastes. So if you're looking for a regular one plate dinner portion, this place ain't it. 

Ambiance: cozy, romantic, casual with cute greenery and mirrors on wall 

Service: A+!! Friendly staff, attentive, knowledgeable and help you make food selections 

Food: it is recommended to order 5 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 4 dishes instead and it was the perfect amount as we left very full. Vaca Frita tacos were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Waiter asked if we wanted to add an extra taco (dish comes with 3). We said yes and so glad we did! Cacio e Pepe was creamy, rich, and I couldn't get enough! Duroc Pork Belly Lollipops was my favorite dish and I can see why it is so popular. It had the perfect balance of smoky, citrus, and subtly sweet. Release the Quacken was also delicious. Duck was tender and paired well with charred leeks and tart sauces. I have a nut allergy so asked if they could do the dish without pistachios. They were very accommodating and made sure to let the kitchen know in all dishes to avoid cross contamination. 

Parking: there is street parking, several small lots around, and one free hidden special lot for Rye. It is about 2 blocks straight West of Rye near Summit Ave & Alta Ave intersection. 

Overall enjoyed Rye and highly recommend!

Review: We loved Rye! Excellent food and the service was phenomenal too. Honestly so good we completely forgot to take more pics! Will definitely be back. 

Also - highly recommend the cocktail bar next door Apothecary.

Review: My favorite part about this restaurant is that the menu is filled with so many interesting and unique options. Everything from the cocktail to the appetizers and main dishes presented some choices I hadn't seen before. 

The drinks were decent - they were fairly tasty, and this restaurant is connected with the bar apothecary next door, but nothing super special.

The food however was very tasty, and everything was played in a very pretty manner. A lot of very earthy tastes in the dishes,l. The restaurant also had a nice aesthetic, esp around the bar area. Lastly, the server was also very friendly and helped us pick out both drinks and dish items since it was our first time. Overall, great experience!

Review: I was surprised here for my birthday! The restaurant is still fairly new to the Greenville area (may have been open for a little more than a year). The menu is mostly tapas style, which I'm the biggest fan of since I love sharing dishes.

The service were superb! Our server knew what was on the menu offhand and had quick recommendations for us. Also, the atmosphere here had me forgetting I was in Dallas, but I felt like I was in a tucked away NYC restaurant.

Let's start with the pork belly lollipops...I don't usually order pork belly, but the presentation and taste was delightful. Because it was shareable, the portion was perfect.

The Icelandic hot dog was OK. This was something the server raved about and I thought it was OK. Im all for trying to new things. I'm just not a big hot dog person, but if you are, maybe you'll think it's great.

Chicken and grits were unique because the grits were crispy.

The Cacio de Pepe (which is my favorite pasta dish ever) was sinfully good. I remember wanting to order a second.

Tip: if you make a reservation here, also make one at Apothecary next door before/after dinner! It's from the same owner as Rye and has a sexy lounge vibe.

Review: Some friends and I decided to try a new place for Easter brunch so went to Rye. As soon as I walked in knew that we had made a good choice. Loved the style and the ambiance of the restaurant, not to mention the bar. Servers and staff were very friendly. 

Started off with the dill drink which was delicious and refreshing. Had a hint of dill and was great to start off a warm morning. For food, I got the eggs benedict. I usually don't eat much for breakfast/brunch but finished my plate. This day the eggs benedict had almost like a pork belly jam and a purple cabbage slaw. The food has a little sweetness and savoriness and just melted in my mouth.

Review: Ambiance it's amazing! The bartenders are so attentive. Great place for cocktails and shareables. 
FYI appetizers are very tiny. Just order the dinner plates and share instead of appetizers. 

Pork lollipops were so so delicious!! 
Victory gardens... don't get.

Review: My boyfriend and I went to Rye for a Valentine's Day dinner and we were pretty disappointed. We decided to splurge and do the nine course dinner. It was A LOT A of food, which we anticipated, but halfway through our meal our waiter said he usually recommends the 7 course...so we were confused why he didn't recommend that to us before we ordered. 

The dishes were very experimental, but a few of them were so salty. The tacos were so salty we couldn't eat more than one bite. Thankfully the manager took them off our bill, but there were at least two or three dishes with overwhelming salt. 

The drinks were ok. I tried to order a French Gimlet, and our server told me that that drink didn't exist...I was confused, so I just ordered something else. Well, French Gimlets do very much exist, so that was odd that he made me feel like I ordered a made up drink! 

The one redeeming thing was the dessert. Honestly one of the best desserts I have ever had and I have not stopped thinking about it! It was so chocolately. 

Overall, won't go back!

Review: Went here to meet some friends from brunch. Atmosphere was very nice. Service was great! I got a sausage croissant sandwich. My friends got the vegetable entree. I thought that my dish had some conceptual issues. The sausage was 2x the size of the croissant so it was incredibly awkward to eat. The vegetable entree was tiny and I ended up giving that friend half of my sausage so she wouldn't be hungry. The dish also came with fries, which were wonderful.
Overall a split experience.

Review: Incredible restaurant experience from start to finish of our meal. The service in amazing--very knowledgeable staff and considerate. The food included a lot of fresh takes on certain dishes which added a lot of flavor and texture to each of them. The drinks were also high level and perfectly balanced. Would definitely recommend for a date night or dinner with friends. Also, great happy hour menu all around.
