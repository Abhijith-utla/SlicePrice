Review: If you have never had iFratelli's pizza you are missing out. I am just happy I don't live is delivery distance or we would have it every week. My favorite is the Italian sausage with jalapeños. I order from them for big company gatherings and always get so many compliments on how yummy the pizza is.

Review: Very sweet young man took my order. He was pleasant and bright, very friendly. I just wanted a slice- they have a 1/4 of a pizza for 5.99, additional for toppings. I got pepperoni  and sausage. It was so hot and fresh- my sneaky urgency didn't allow me to take a bite without the roof of my mouth being set on fire. I waited to devour the rest at home. 

Enjoyed the flavor, the taste, the Roxie and the kindness. 
Check them out.

Review: I wanted pizza today so one of my friends recommended this place to me. Y'all I have lived over here for almost 10 years and I just can't believe I've never tried them. When I walked in the gentleman at the front was very friendly and welcoming which is def a plus for me. 
I ordered online because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and hamburger on it and it was just amazing. I believe all the pizzas come in a flatbread style which tasted amazing but horrible for me cause I almost ate the whole pizza by myself . I actually want to order again today but imma have self control and wait till next week. 
If you needed a sign to go here it is , Go now and try them out.

Review: We orderd and it was estimated for 34 minues.  After 45, we called to inquire and were told it was "on the heat rack", but they wee still waiting for the delivery person to return and would be at least another 10-15 minutes.  Great!  The pizza will be under the heat lamp for 25 minutes!  Now my husband is just going to pick it up.  So glad we already tipped!  Trying somewhere else next time!

Review: I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. The two pizza's we got were burned on the thin crust. The breadsticks were burned on the bottom and tasted old. The salads were ok. The reason I even gave this place 2 stars is because their ranch dressing was pretty good. But if you want pizza that tastes like Dominoes, get it from here becuase that's what it reminded me of. Dominoes is cheaper tho.

Review: This location has become the go-to for pizza catering at our office. They provide great service, and the food is definitely top notch. Recently, we had an issue with an order; specifically, it arrived late to our office. i Fratelli promised to make it right, and they were able to resolve the issue to our satisfaction with some great followup service, going above and beyond our expectations. 

But what of the food? i Fratelli specializes in thin crust pies, shaped like an oval, but with straight sides. They're cut into thin strips, making it easy for trying multiple flavors if you have several available, and minimizing waste. I've tried almost every standard flavor that they offer, and they're all delicious. The Big Brother (supreme) is definitely a favorite, striking a great balance between meat and vegetable toppings. The Carne Classico will fill all of your meat cravings, with delicious, big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, hamburger, and more. They also make a mean margherita for those who like to keep it simple. 

Dine in or to go, i Fratelli will (wait for it) deliver :)

Review: LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza. Always on time when I've ordered for large pick up orders. Always have the order correct. Great service.

I've ordered for office party catering and still amazing. GREAT JOB!!! GREAT PIZZA!

We ordered two pizzas, one looking like it had been caught up in F-5 twister both undercooked, the only real taste I could identify was flour. That was a waste of $42.03 and after one bit will be going into the trash. Waste of time, waste of money and hopefully won't be sick. It's raw!

Review: Pretty good thin crust pizza. Ordered the pepperoni and mushroom and ate outside at one of their patio tables with my dog. Appreciated the fast and courteous service. 

Unfortunately, the inside dining area does not exist and they don't have a soda machine. Instead, they serve cans. So it's a perfect place to grab a slice and go, or to order takeout/delivery. But it's not much of a restaurant.

I appreciated the opportunity to sit outside in the nice weather with my dog and eat some good pizza.

Review: Pizza is good, and I fratelli does it right. Ordered Delivery and it was about the normal time for it. However, the pizza and salad was worth the wait.

Finally the salad, omg. We used a little more dressing than normal, but it was perfect. I recommend the pizza here.

Review: Quick Note!!

Double check your pizza when you get it delivered. Our pizza was incorrect but I didn't catch it until we opened the box later to eat it.   It also looked like it may have sat for a while in the store before being delivered.

I contacted them but haven't heard back yet. 

Note:  we have ordered previously with no major problems.

Review: Well after all the hoopla it wasn't as great as they said. The customer service was good. Very polite and cordial. The wait was reasonable as well. However upon getting home and taking the first bite of disappointment I was let down! The toppings seem fresh and delicious. The crust however was cooked longer than needed it seems and the burnt crust taste ruined it for me! So I'll definitely have to bring this to their attention on the next visit. I love pizza so I'll do a second chance!

Review: I ordered delivery, so my perspective is limited; however, the person with whom I spoke and the one who delivered my pizza were both excellent! The first seemed truly interested in my order and very personable. The latter was genuinely in good spirits and mind you, it was pouring down rain, and was most gracious. My Order was correct and the pizza... delicious!  Do yourself a favor and Order your next pizza from i Fratelli Pizza.

Review: This location is so amazing! I called to order a couple of pizzas a few days ago and I had never called this location for delivery. I placed this order in the morning and was a bit worried it would not be here on time. However, i Fratelli definitely proved me wrong. They brought in the food on time and it was delicious! I was even more pleasantly surprised when they called me a few hours later and asked how everything was! Talk about top notch customer service! That's not even the best part. (Hard to believe) Yesterday, they sent me a ticket for a complimentary pizza! Luckily it could be used at any location and I took my ticket over to the Grapevine location near my place. I love when businesses have excellent service, not to mention great food. I will continue to be a loyal customer of i Fratelli! You will not be disappointed. Cheers to the awesome folks who are running the Plano West restaurant!

Review: I had these guys' pizza through others ordering it at events I was at, and this was my first time ordering myself. First off, as you may see from all the pictures, their pizzas are rectangular shaped and sliced into rectangular pieces as well. This leaves those crust lovers with very little crust. The topping run all way to the edge, and they don't skimp. The crust is thin and crispy. We had the Big Brother which is essentially a combo pizza and it was decent, but on the salty side, even for pizza. The bread sticks were amazing though, as the seasoning and fluffiness was perfect! 

The Plano location is just off the Tollway and Park and doesn't have seating inside, just a couple of small tables outside. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Review: I discovered this place a few weeks ago by accident, just driving in their shopping center. It has quickly become my favorite pizza place in town. In terms of taste, value, and customer experience, no other pizzeria in Dallas can touch it. I usually am helped by either Jared or Doug and they are both outstanding. Their kind of attention to detail and professionalism are more in line with a 5-star restaurant. You're treated very well here.

Also, ya know how after you eat a bunch of pizza, you usually feel kinda bloated and gross? Not here. The pizza is NOT greasy and the toppings always taste very fresh and wholesome. My favorite is the "Chef's Special" but there's plenty more to choose from.

I have experienced so many bad places in town that I feel compelled to let people know how great this place is. You won't be disappointed!

Review: Ordered a medium pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno pizza. added desserr and a side salad.  It came out to be 20.57

The pizza is thin crust and reminded me of Shakeys pizza, except Shakeys sauce has a tart kick to it.  The toppings tasted fresh, which is a plus.

The side salad only came with a standard Italian dressing, it was seriously lacking in flavor. 

The guy forgot to give me napkins or a fork with dinner. Guess I will be eating this salad with my fingers. They staple the salad paper bag but i assumed it was in there, i should've checked myself tho.

Altogether, it was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say this is a step up from dominos or pizza hut.

Review: Well I finally got around to trying this place out after much debate, and now I'm just like "what took me so long?!" I love many sorts of pizzas- especially thin crust. And the thin crust here is amazing! I ordered a simple medium thin crust pepperoni just to get a good feel for what their pizza was like. While it might not look like much, it is very filling and perfectly seasoned! They sprinkle it with a nice blend of Italian spices which puts them a step above the rest. I'll definitely be back to try out some more topping combinations! 

Fyi it's take out only (and delivery if you're in range), but there a few seats to sit and wait for your order.

Review: Got this place to deliver for a fun girls night in! Placed our order at 9, and driver had the pizza in our hands in under 30 minutes. 

Their pizza is PHENOMENAL- thin crust, fresh toppings, not doughy! Authentic Italian pizza style! They were happy to take our special make your own order and got it right! 

Good price for authentic pizza! 18 for a large with 3 toppings! Not bad for a meal for two and plenty of leftovers !

Review: I have a Yelp account but I don't normally post on here like I should because well...life happens and too much time passes and the review never gets posted. This time, I felt it was imperative to make sure I post this. This store has the MOST impressive customer service from the GM, Jarret to Chuck, who will probably be the one you talk to when you call.   The pizza is just as awesome as the crew that makes it. The toppings are so fresh and they are not shy with them!  It's the kinda pizza you daydream about when you're watching calories during the week lol. Love their house salad as well. Exceptional product and customer service - you can't ask for more.

Review: Ordered the veggie lovers pizza.  First, delivery was very fast.  They said an hour, seemed more like 20 mins.
The pizza itself was very disappointing.  Should have just bought some olives at the store since that's pretty much what the pizza tasted like.  Couldn't taste cheese or sauce, just waaaayy to many olives, overwhelmingly so.  Ate a slice and tossed it, waste of $28.  Digiornio next time.

Review: So me and my office compatriot's just finished scarfing down two large pizzas, some bread sticks, and a salad. There were four of us working on it all and we ended up leaving just about 1/2 a pizza in the work fridge for whomever forgets their lunch tomorrow. Overall, I cant say its the best pizza around, I reserve that for thick crust, deep dish, overloaded with cheese and toppings pizza, but it was pretty good. 

We had the Big Brother, which was truly loaded down with toppings and cheese, and a two topping of our own creation. They win points, because their mushrooms are fresh, not canned, and they provide little packets of pepper and cheese with the order. On our own creation, we did halves of Jalapenos and Pineapple with Pepperoni (not on the same side) and it wasn't lacking for toppings in my opinion. 

The pizza was oblong (like a football) and the middle was done perfectly, but the outer edge was a bit too black for my tastes. It had a great crispness that reminded me of one of my favorite places back home, but lost a star with the excess char on the edges. The bread sticks were good, nothing special, but with only 3 to an order (it seemed like an odd, pun intended, number to put in an order) we were left splitting them up between the four of us. 

For office delivery, they were very prompt and accommodating, seeing as we are on the outside edge of their delivery area...They said 30-45 minutes and it was here in 35....definitely helped their rating and future business from this office crew. 

Overall, we'd probably do it again if only because they delivered and were prompt with the order. It was a great value, using a buy one get one free coupon they offered for joining their e-club, at only 6 bucks a person (including tip).

Review: I really really like this place. When they first opened the Greenville location, they offered to bring my office of 7 people free lunch. I thought this would include 2 large pizzas or something. WRONG. They showed up with three huge pizzas, salads for everyone, dessert, and paper plates/napkins/utensils. How awesome! We ordered from them many times afterwards and enjoyed it each time. I've also ordered from the Plano location and it seems pretty consistent.

This is my new favorite pizza delivery. They are generous with toppings and the crust is delicious. I recommend ordering the pizza well done and with extra sauce. The extra sauce put it over the edge for me and made for a finger licking good pizza! The meat lover's pizza was a little OTT. I enjoy the veggie, or a simple pepperoni more.
I have had the salad, and while it only really comes with lettuce, one or two olives, and a pickled pepper (like Papa John's) the italian dressing is YUMMY! I thought I wouldn't care for the salad when I saw that it was just lettuce, but it was so good I finished every bite.

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! You won't regret it :)

Review: Great service and absolutely delicious. We ordered delivery, using a coupon on the website for a large 3-topping, breadsticks and two house salads ($18.95 or something thereabouts). 

Delivery came quickly, under 30 minutes. We went with hamburger, fresh basil and black olives. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the pie was piled with ground beef (reminded me of my Midwestern roots, where pizza parlors would season and fry a pound of meat and load it up) - no sparse toppings here. Every bite had crumbled beef, enough olives to taste but not overwhelm, and fragrant fresh basil. They really did not skimp on anything. The pizza was very balanced with a good ratio of crust, toppings, sauce. I personally love thin crust, so I was a happy camper. My husband tends toward thick/deep dish, but he agreed this was super good and wanted to know when we could order it again.

The house salad was essentially romaine (and maybe some iceberg) lettuce topped with fresh green onions. The house dressing was a delicious Italian, rich and balanced. It was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the pizza.

Incidentally, the delivery driver neglected our breadsticks. We tried to call her really quick after she left, just in case she was still in our apartment lot and could just turn around. She didn't answer, so we called the store to see if maybe they could get her before she got too far away. We weren't really stressing the breadsticks, if we didn't get them it wasn't a big deal, but we thought we'd try anyway. 

Crazy good customer service. When I called the store, I was referred to the manager who apologized profusely, said they would send the breadsticks right back out - and would comp the entire meal!! Holy smokes! We really were impressed. That's incredibly generous for just a missed order of breadsticks, and we will definitely order again. 

By the way, the breadsticks were thick, warm and covered in cheese. I was slowly nodding off from my food coma, but still ate one and a half of them dipped in marinara. Later I passed out. And mumbled things to myself about the sweet pizza.

However upon getting home and taking the first bite of disappointment I was let down! The toppings seem fresh and delicious. The crust however was cooked longer than needed it seems and the burnt crust taste ruined it for me! So I'll definitely have to bring this to their attention on the next visit. I love pizza so I'll do a second chance!

Review: This review is after few orders and none were a disappointment.  Staff are always friendly and their dough... let's take a moment and discuss the dough; THAT IS SOME GOOD DOUGH!!!!   My wife caught me and my dog the other day, on the kitchen floor at 3am, destroying her pizza... what can I say though, it's a great pizza!!!

Review: I ordered delivery, so my perspective is limited; however, the person with whom I spoke and the one who delivered my pizza were both excellent! The first seemed truly interested in my order and very personable. The latter was genuinely in good spirits and mind you, it was pouring down rain, and was most gracious. My Order was correct and the pizza... delicious!  Do yourself a favor and Order your next pizza from i Fratelli Pizza.

Review: I ordered online for pick-up and was not disappointed, I got a large margherita and vegetarian. It's on the more expensive side for takeout or delivery pizza but the quality is definitely worth it! They add plenty of toppings and the staff was very friendly, 10/10 can't wait to order from them again.

Review: This location is so amazing! I called to order a couple of pizzas a few days ago and I had never called this location for delivery. I placed this order in the morning and was a bit worried it would not be here on time. However, i Fratelli definitely proved me wrong. They brought in the food on time and it was delicious! I was even more pleasantly surprised when they called me a few hours later and asked how everything was! Talk about top notch customer service! That's not even the best part. (Hard to believe) Yesterday, they sent me a ticket for a complimentary pizza! Luckily it could be used at any location and I took my ticket over to the Grapevine location near my place. I love when businesses have excellent service, not to mention great food. I will continue to be a loyal customer of i Fratelli! You will not be disappointed. Cheers to the awesome folks who are running the Plano West restaurant!

Review: I had these guys' pizza through others ordering it at events I was at, and this was my first time ordering myself. First off, as you may see from all the pictures, their pizzas are rectangular shaped and sliced into rectangular pieces as well. This leaves those crust lovers with very little crust. The topping run all way to the edge, and they don't skimp. The crust is thin and crispy. We had the Big Brother which is essentially a combo pizza and it was decent, but on the salty side, even for pizza. The bread sticks were amazing though, as the seasoning and fluffiness was perfect! 

The Plano location is just off the Tollway and Park and doesn't have seating inside, just a couple of small tables outside. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Review: I discovered this place a few weeks ago by accident, just driving in their shopping center. It has quickly become my favorite pizza place in town. In terms of taste, value, and customer experience, no other pizzeria in Dallas can touch it. I usually am helped by either Jared or Doug and they are both outstanding. Their kind of attention to detail and professionalism are more in line with a 5-star restaurant. You're treated very well here.

Also, ya know how after you eat a bunch of pizza, you usually feel kinda bloated and gross? Not here. The pizza is NOT greasy and the toppings always taste very fresh and wholesome. My favorite is the "Chef's Special" but there's plenty more to choose from.

I have experienced so many bad places in town that I feel compelled to let people know how great this place is. You won't be disappointed!

Review: Ordered a medium pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno pizza. added desserr and a side salad.  It came out to be 20.57

The pizza is thin crust and reminded me of Shakeys pizza, except Shakeys sauce has a tart kick to it.  The toppings tasted fresh, which is a plus.

The side salad only came with a standard Italian dressing, it was seriously lacking in flavor. 

The guy forgot to give me napkins or a fork with dinner. Guess I will be eating this salad with my fingers. They staple the salad paper bag but i assumed it was in there, i should've checked myself tho.

Altogether, it was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say this is a step up from dominos or pizza hut.

Review: Well I finally got around to trying this place out after much debate, and now I'm just like "what took me so long?!" I love many sorts of pizzas- especially thin crust. And the thin crust here is amazing! I ordered a simple medium thin crust pepperoni just to get a good feel for what their pizza was like. While it might not look like much, it is very filling and perfectly seasoned! They sprinkle it with a nice blend of Italian spices which puts them a step above the rest. I'll definitely be back to try out some more topping combinations! 

Fyi it's take out only (and delivery if you're in range), but there a few seats to sit and wait for your order.

Review: Got this place to deliver for a fun girls night in! Placed our order at 9, and driver had the pizza in our hands in under 30 minutes. 

Their pizza is PHENOMENAL- thin crust, fresh toppings, not doughy! Authentic Italian pizza style! They were happy to take our special make your own order and got it right! 

Good price for authentic pizza! 18 for a large with 3 toppings! Not bad for a meal for two and plenty of leftovers !

Review: Ordered the veggie lovers pizza.  First, delivery was very fast.  They said an hour, seemed more like 20 mins.
The pizza itself was very disappointing.  Should have just bought some olives at the store since that's pretty much what the pizza tasted like.  Couldn't taste cheese or sauce, just waaaayy to many olives, overwhelmingly so.  Ate a slice and tossed it, waste of $28.  Digiornio next time.

Review: So me and my office compatriot's just finished scarfing down two large pizzas, some bread sticks, and a salad. There were four of us working on it all and we ended up leaving just about 1/2 a pizza in the work fridge for whomever forgets their lunch tomorrow. Overall, I cant say its the best pizza around, I reserve that for thick crust, deep dish, overloaded with cheese and toppings pizza, but it was pretty good. 

We had the Big Brother, which was truly loaded down with toppings and cheese, and a two topping of our own creation. They win points, because their mushrooms are fresh, not canned, and they provide little packets of pepper and cheese with the order. On our own creation, we did halves of Jalapenos and Pineapple with Pepperoni (not on the same side) and it wasn't lacking for toppings in my opinion. 

The pizza was oblong (like a football) and the middle was done perfectly, but the outer edge was a bit too black for my tastes. It had a great crispness that reminded me of one of my favorite places back home, but lost a star with the excess char on the edges. The bread sticks were good, nothing special, but with only 3 to an order (it seemed like an odd, pun intended, number to put in an order) we were left splitting them up between the four of us. 

For office delivery, they were very prompt and accommodating, seeing as we are on the outside edge of their delivery area...They said 30-45 minutes and it was here in 35....definitely helped their rating and future business from this office crew. 

Overall, we'd probably do it again if only because they delivered and were prompt with the order. It was a great value, using a buy one get one free coupon they offered for joining their e-club, at only 6 bucks a person (including tip).

Review: I really really like this place. When they first opened the Greenville location, they offered to bring my office of 7 people free lunch. I thought this would include 2 large pizzas or something. WRONG. They showed up with three huge pizzas, salads for everyone, dessert, and paper plates/napkins/utensils. How awesome! We ordered from them many times afterwards and enjoyed it each time. I've also ordered from the Plano location and it seems pretty consistent.

This is my new favorite pizza delivery. They are generous with toppings and the crust is delicious. I recommend ordering the pizza well done and with extra sauce. The extra sauce put it over the edge for me and made for a finger licking good pizza! The meat lover's pizza was a little OTT. I enjoy the veggie, or a simple pepperoni more.
I have had the salad, and while it only really comes with lettuce, one or two olives, and a pickled pepper (like Papa John's) the italian dressing is YUMMY! I thought I wouldn't care for the salad when I saw that it was just lettuce, but it was so good I finished every bite.

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! You won't regret it :)

Review: Great service and absolutely delicious. We ordered delivery, using a coupon on the website for a large 3-topping, breadsticks and two house salads ($18.95 or something thereabouts). 

Delivery came quickly, under 30 minutes. We went with hamburger, fresh basil and black olives. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the pie was piled with ground beef (reminded me of my Midwestern roots, where pizza parlors would season and fry a pound of meat and load it up) - no sparse toppings here. Every bite had crumbled beef, enough olives to taste but not overwhelm, and fragrant fresh basil. They really did not skimp on anything. The pizza was very balanced with a good ratio of crust, toppings, sauce. I personally love thin crust, so I was a happy camper. My husband tends toward thick/deep dish, but he agreed this was super good and wanted to know when we could order it again.

The house salad was essentially romaine (and maybe some iceberg) lettuce topped with fresh green onions. The house dressing was a delicious Italian, rich and balanced. It was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the pizza.

Incidentally, the delivery driver neglected our breadsticks. We tried to call her really quick after she left, just in case she was still in our apartment lot and could just turn around. She didn't answer, so we called the store to see if maybe they could get her before she got too far away. We weren't really stressing the breadsticks, if we didn't get them it wasn't a big deal, but we thought we'd try anyway. 

Crazy good customer service. When I called the store, I was referred to the manager who apologized profusely, said they would send the breadsticks right back out - and would comp the entire meal!! Holy smokes! We really were impressed. That's incredibly generous for just a missed order of breadsticks, and we will definitely order again. 

By the way, the breadsticks were thick, warm and covered in cheese. I was slowly nodding off from my food coma, but still ate one and a half of them dipped in marinara. Later I passed out. And mumbled things to myself about the sweet pizza.

Review: If you have never had iFratelli's pizza you are missing out. I am just happy I don't live is delivery distance or we would have it every week.

Review: Very sweet young man took my order. He was pleasant and bright, very friendly. I just wanted a slice- they have a 1/4 of a pizza for 5.99, additional for toppings. I got pepperoni  and sausage. It was so hot and fresh- my sneaky urgency didn't allow me to take a bite without the roof of my mouth being set on fire. I waited to devour the rest at home. 

Enjoyed the flavor, the taste, the Roxie and the kindness. 
Check them out.

Review: I wanted pizza today so one of my friends recommended this place to me. Y'all I have lived over here for almost 10 years and I just can't believe I've never tried them. When I walked in the gentleman at the front was very friendly and welcoming which is def a plus for me. 
I ordered online because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and hamburger on it and it was just amazing. I believe all the pizzas come in a flatbread style which tasted amazing but horrible for me cause I almost ate the whole pizza by myself . I actually want to order again today but imma have self control and wait till next week. 
If you needed a sign to go here it is , Go now and try them out.

Review: We orderd and it was estimated for 34 minues.  After 45, we called to inquire and were told it was "on the heat rack", but they wee still waiting for the delivery person to return and would be at least another 10-15 minutes.  Great!  The pizza will be under the heat lamp for 25 minutes!  Now my husband is just going to pick it up.  So glad we already tipped!  Trying somewhere else next time!

Review: NEVER TRUST A BURNT PIZZA

Review: I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. The two pizza's we got were burned on the thin crust. The breadsticks were burned on the bottom and tasted old. The salads were ok. The reason I even gave this place 2 stars is because their ranch dressing was pretty good. But if you want pizza that tastes like Dominoes, get it from here becuase that's what it reminded me of. Dominoes is cheaper tho.

Review: This location has become the go-to for pizza catering at our office. They provide great service, and the food is definitely top notch. Recently, we had an issue with an order; specifically, it arrived late to our office. i Fratelli promised to make it right, and they were able to resolve the issue to our satisfaction with some great followup service, going above and beyond our expectations. 

But what of the food? i Fratelli specializes in thin crust pies, shaped like an oval, but with straight sides. They're cut into thin strips, making it easy for trying multiple flavors if you have several available, and minimizing waste. I've tried almost every standard flavor that they offer, and they're all delicious. The Big Brother (supreme) is definitely a favorite, striking a great balance between meat and vegetable toppings. The Carne Classico will fill all of your meat cravings, with delicious, big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, hamburger, and more. They also make a mean margherita for those who like to keep it simple. 

Dine in or to go, i Fratelli will (wait for it) deliver :)

Review: LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza. Always on time when I've ordered for large pick up orders. Always have the order correct. Great service. Generous toppings! my favorite is extra sauce, extra olives on the vegetarian but the BIG brother is amazing if you like meat! This is the best pizza if you enjoy thin crust. Salads are great too. I've ordered for office party catering and still amazing. GREAT JOB!!! GREAT PIZZA!

His customer service and kindness was above and beyond. We will definitely be using them again! Thank you for an awesome experience!!!

Review: This place is terrible, ignore the good reviews they are mostly old. Tried a new place with i Fratelli and "i" learned learned the hard way, their taste is less than bland. We ordered two pizzas, one looking like it had been caught up in F-5 twister both undercooked, the only real taste I could identify was flour. That was a waste of $42.03 and after one bit will be going into the trash. Waste of time, waste of money and hopefully won't be sick. It's raw!

Review: Pretty good thin crust pizza. Ordered the pepperoni and mushroom and ate outside at one of their patio tables with my dog. Appreciated the fast and courteous service. 

Unfortunately, the inside dining area does not exist and they don't have a soda machine. Instead, they serve cans. So it's a perfect place to grab a slice and go, or to order takeout/delivery. But it's not much of a restaurant.

I appreciated the opportunity to sit outside in the nice weather with my dog and eat some good pizza.

Review: Pizza is good, and I fratelli does it right. Ordered Delivery and it was about the normal time for it. However, the pizza and salad was worth the wait.

We got a pepperoni, marghareita, and meat pizza. All delicious, but the marghareita was my favorite one. The fresh tomatoes really brought flavor out the sauce, and the cheese was great. The pizza was a thin crust which I loved, and it was crispy. 

Finally the salad, omg. We used a little more dressing than normal, but it was perfect. I recommend the pizza here.

Double check your pizza when you get it delivered. Our pizza was incorrect but I didn't catch it until we opened the box later to eat it.   It also looked like it may have sat for a while in the store before being delivered.

I contacted them but haven't heard back yet.

Review: I really really like this place. When they first opened the Greenville location, they offered to bring my office of 7 people free lunch. I thought this would include 2 large pizzas or something. WRONG. They showed up with three huge pizzas, salads for everyone, dessert, and paper plates/napkins/utensils. How awesome! We ordered from them many times afterwards and enjoyed it each time. I've also ordered from the Plano location and it seems pretty consistent.

This is my new favorite pizza delivery. They are generous with toppings and the crust is delicious. I recommend ordering the pizza well done and with extra sauce. The extra sauce put it over the edge for me and made for a finger licking good pizza! The meat lover's pizza was a little OTT. I enjoy the veggie, or a simple pepperoni more.
I have had the salad, and while it only really comes with lettuce, one or two olives, and a pickled pepper (like Papa John's) the italian dressing is YUMMY! I thought I wouldn't care for the salad when I saw that it was just lettuce, but it was so good I finished every bite.

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! You won't regret it :)

Review: Great service and absolutely delicious. We ordered delivery, using a coupon on the website for a large 3-topping, breadsticks and two house salads ($18.95 or something thereabouts). 

Delivery came quickly, under 30 minutes. We went with hamburger, fresh basil and black olives. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the pie was piled with ground beef (reminded me of my Midwestern roots, where pizza parlors would season and fry a pound of meat and load it up) - no sparse toppings here. Every bite had crumbled beef, enough olives to taste but not overwhelm, and fragrant fresh basil. They really did not skimp on anything. The pizza was very balanced with a good ratio of crust, toppings, sauce. I personally love thin crust, so I was a happy camper. My husband tends toward thick/deep dish, but he agreed this was super good and wanted to know when we could order it again.

The house salad was essentially romaine (and maybe some iceberg) lettuce topped with fresh green onions. The house dressing was a delicious Italian, rich and balanced. It was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the pizza.

Incidentally, the delivery driver neglected our breadsticks. We tried to call her really quick after she left, just in case she was still in our apartment lot and could just turn around. She didn't answer, so we called the store to see if maybe they could get her before she got too far away. We weren't really stressing the breadsticks, if we didn't get them it wasn't a big deal, but we thought we'd try anyway. 

Crazy good customer service. When I called the store, I was referred to the manager who apologized profusely, said they would send the breadsticks right back out - and would comp the entire meal!! Holy smokes! We really were impressed. That's incredibly generous for just a missed order of breadsticks, and we will definitely order again. 

By the way, the breadsticks were thick, warm and covered in cheese. I was slowly nodding off from my food coma, but still ate one and a half of them dipped in marinara. Later I passed out. And mumbled things to myself about the sweet pizza.

I ordered online because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and hamburger on it and it was just amazing.

Review: I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. The two pizza's we got were burned on the thin crust. The breadsticks were burned on the bottom and tasted old. The salads were ok. The reason I even gave this place 2 stars is because their ranch dressing was pretty good. But if you want pizza that tastes like Dominoes, get it from here becuase that's what it reminded me of. Dominoes is cheaper tho.

Review: This location has become the go-to for pizza catering at our office. They provide great service, and the food is definitely top notch. Recently, we had an issue with an order; specifically, it arrived late to our office. i Fratelli promised to make it right, and they were able to resolve the issue to our satisfaction with some great followup service, going above and beyond our expectations. 

But what of the food? i Fratelli specializes in thin crust pies, shaped like an oval, but with straight sides. They're cut into thin strips, making it easy for trying multiple flavors if you have several available, and minimizing waste. I've tried almost every standard flavor that they offer, and they're all delicious. The Big Brother (supreme) is definitely a favorite, striking a great balance between meat and vegetable toppings. The Carne Classico will fill all of your meat cravings, with delicious, big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, hamburger, and more. They also make a mean margherita for those who like to keep it simple. 

Dine in or to go, i Fratelli will (wait for it) deliver :)

Review: LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza. Always on time when I've ordered for large pick up orders. Always have the order correct. Great service. Generous toppings! my favorite is extra sauce, extra olives on the vegetarian but the BIG brother is amazing if you like meat! This is the best pizza if you enjoy thin crust. Salads are great too. I've ordered for office party catering and still amazing. GREAT JOB!!! GREAT PIZZA!

Review: Customer service and food quality is the BEST! Ordered a few pizzas and a salad for a staff meeting... the salad was incredibly fresh and huge(Caesar that feeds 10+)! Every pizza was fresh and tasty! My employees were impressed with the gluten free option. Matthew followed up with us to see how our order was... what pizza place does that?! His customer service and kindness was above and beyond. We will definitely be using them again! Thank you for an awesome experience!!!

Review: This place is terrible, ignore the good reviews they are mostly old. Tried a new place with i Fratelli and "i" learned learned the hard way, their taste is less than bland. We ordered two pizzas, one looking like it had been caught up in F-5 twister both undercooked, the only real taste I could identify was flour. That was a waste of $42.03 and after one bit will be going into the trash. Waste of time, waste of money and hopefully won't be sick. It's raw!

Review: Pretty good thin crust pizza. Ordered the pepperoni and mushroom and ate outside at one of their patio tables with my dog. Appreciated the fast and courteous service. 

Unfortunately, the inside dining area does not exist and they don't have a soda machine. Instead, they serve cans. So it's a perfect place to grab a slice and go, or to order takeout/delivery. But it's not much of a restaurant.

I appreciated the opportunity to sit outside in the nice weather with my dog and eat some good pizza.

Review: Pizza is good, and I fratelli does it right. Ordered Delivery and it was about the normal time for it. However, the pizza and salad was worth the wait.

We got a pepperoni, marghareita, and meat pizza. All delicious, but the marghareita was my favorite one. The fresh tomatoes really brought flavor out the sauce, and the cheese was great. The pizza was a thin crust which I loved, and it was crispy. 

Finally the salad, omg. We used a little more dressing than normal, but it was perfect. I recommend the pizza here.

I hate that it too so long for me to know this place but now that I know am hooked.

Review: Quick Note!!

Double check your pizza when you get it delivered. Our pizza was incorrect but I didn't catch it until we opened the box later to eat it.   It also looked like it may have sat for a while in the store before being delivered.

I contacted them but haven't heard back yet. 

Note:  we have ordered previously with no major problems.

Review: Well after all the hoopla it wasn't as great as they said. The customer service was good. Very polite and cordial. The wait was reasonable as well. However upon getting home and taking the first bite of disappointment I was let down! The toppings seem fresh and delicious. The crust however was cooked longer than needed it seems and the burnt crust taste ruined it for me! So I'll definitely have to bring this to their attention on the next visit. I love pizza so I'll do a second chance!

Review: I ordered delivery, so my perspective is limited; however, the person with whom I spoke and the one who delivered my pizza were both excellent! The first seemed truly interested in my order and very personable. The latter was genuinely in good spirits and mind you, it was pouring down rain, and was most gracious. My Order was correct and the pizza... delicious!  Do yourself a favor and Order your next pizza from i Fratelli Pizza.

Review: This location is so amazing! I called to order a couple of pizzas a few days ago and I had never called this location for delivery. I placed this order in the morning and was a bit worried it would not be here on time. However, i Fratelli definitely proved me wrong. They brought in the food on time and it was delicious! I was even more pleasantly surprised when they called me a few hours later and asked how everything was! Talk about top notch customer service! That's not even the best part. (Hard to believe) Yesterday, they sent me a ticket for a complimentary pizza! Luckily it could be used at any location and I took my ticket over to the Grapevine location near my place. I love when businesses have excellent service, not to mention great food. I will continue to be a loyal customer of i Fratelli! You will not be disappointed. Cheers to the awesome folks who are running the Plano West restaurant!

Review: I had these guys' pizza through others ordering it at events I was at, and this was my first time ordering myself. First off, as you may see from all the pictures, their pizzas are rectangular shaped and sliced into rectangular pieces as well. This leaves those crust lovers with very little crust. The topping run all way to the edge, and they don't skimp. The crust is thin and crispy. We had the Big Brother which is essentially a combo pizza and it was decent, but on the salty side, even for pizza. The bread sticks were amazing though, as the seasoning and fluffiness was perfect! 

The Plano location is just off the Tollway and Park and doesn't have seating inside, just a couple of small tables outside. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Review: I discovered this place a few weeks ago by accident, just driving in their shopping center. It has quickly become my favorite pizza place in town. In terms of taste, value, and customer experience, no other pizzeria in Dallas can touch it. I usually am helped by either Jared or Doug and they are both outstanding. Their kind of attention to detail and professionalism are more in line with a 5-star restaurant. You're treated very well here.

Also, ya know how after you eat a bunch of pizza, you usually feel kinda bloated and gross? Not here. The pizza is NOT greasy and the toppings always taste very fresh and wholesome. My favorite is the "Chef's Special" but there's plenty more to choose from.

I have experienced so many bad places in town that I feel compelled to let people know how great this place is. You won't be disappointed!

Review: Ordered a medium pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno pizza. added desserr and a side salad.  It came out to be 20.57

The pizza is thin crust and reminded me of Shakeys pizza, except Shakeys sauce has a tart kick to it.  The toppings tasted fresh, which is a plus.

The side salad only came with a standard Italian dressing, it was seriously lacking in flavor. 

The guy forgot to give me napkins or a fork with dinner. Guess I will be eating this salad with my fingers. They staple the salad paper bag but i assumed it was in there, i should've checked myself tho.

Altogether, it was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say this is a step up from dominos or pizza hut.

Review: Well I finally got around to trying this place out after much debate, and now I'm just like "what took me so long?!" I love many sorts of pizzas- especially thin crust. And the thin crust here is amazing! I ordered a simple medium thin crust pepperoni just to get a good feel for what their pizza was like. While it might not look like much, it is very filling and perfectly seasoned! They sprinkle it with a nice blend of Italian spices which puts them a step above the rest. I'll definitely be back to try out some more topping combinations! 

Fyi it's take out only (and delivery if you're in range), but there a few seats to sit and wait for your order.

Review: Got this place to deliver for a fun girls night in! Placed our order at 9, and driver had the pizza in our hands in under 30 minutes. 

Their pizza is PHENOMENAL- thin crust, fresh toppings, not doughy! Authentic Italian pizza style! They were happy to take our special make your own order and got it right! 

Good price for authentic pizza! 18 for a large with 3 toppings! Not bad for a meal for two and plenty of leftovers !

Review: I have a Yelp account but I don't normally post on here like I should because well...life happens and too much time passes and the review never gets posted. This time, I felt it was imperative to make sure I post this. This store has the MOST impressive customer service from the GM, Jarret to Chuck, who will probably be the one you talk to when you call.   The pizza is just as awesome as the crew that makes it. The toppings are so fresh and they are not shy with them!  It's the kinda pizza you daydream about when you're watching calories during the week lol. Love their house salad as well. Exceptional product and customer service - you can't ask for more.

Review: Ordered the veggie lovers pizza.  First, delivery was very fast.  They said an hour, seemed more like 20 mins.
The pizza itself was very disappointing.  Should have just bought some olives at the store since that's pretty much what the pizza tasted like.  Couldn't taste cheese or sauce, just waaaayy to many olives, overwhelmingly so.  Ate a slice and tossed it, waste of $28.  Digiornio next time.

Review: So me and my office compatriot's just finished scarfing down two large pizzas, some bread sticks, and a salad. There were four of us working on it all and we ended up leaving just about 1/2 a pizza in the work fridge for whomever forgets their lunch tomorrow. Overall, I cant say its the best pizza around, I reserve that for thick crust, deep dish, overloaded with cheese and toppings pizza, but it was pretty good. 

We had the Big Brother, which was truly loaded down with toppings and cheese, and a two topping of our own creation. They win points, because their mushrooms are fresh, not canned, and they provide little packets of pepper and cheese with the order. On our own creation, we did halves of Jalapenos and Pineapple with Pepperoni (not on the same side) and it wasn't lacking for toppings in my opinion. 

The pizza was oblong (like a football) and the middle was done perfectly, but the outer edge was a bit too black for my tastes. It had a great crispness that reminded me of one of my favorite places back home, but lost a star with the excess char on the edges. The bread sticks were good, nothing special, but with only 3 to an order (it seemed like an odd, pun intended, number to put in an order) we were left splitting them up between the four of us. 

For office delivery, they were very prompt and accommodating, seeing as we are on the outside edge of their delivery area...They said 30-45 minutes and it was here in 35....definitely helped their rating and future business from this office crew. 

Overall, we'd probably do it again if only because they delivered and were prompt with the order. It was a great value, using a buy one get one free coupon they offered for joining their e-club, at only 6 bucks a person (including tip).

Review: LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza. Always on time when I've ordered for large pick up orders. Always have the order correct. Great service. Generous toppings! my favorite is extra sauce, extra olives on the vegetarian but the BIG brother is amazing if you like meat! This is the best pizza if you enjoy thin crust. Salads are great too. I've ordered for office party catering and still amazing. GREAT JOB!!! GREAT PIZZA!

Review: Customer service and food quality is the BEST! Ordered a few pizzas and a salad for a staff meeting... the salad was incredibly fresh and huge(Caesar that feeds 10+)! Every pizza was fresh and tasty! My employees were impressed with the gluten free option. Matthew followed up with us to see how our order was... what pizza place does that?! His customer service and kindness was above and beyond. We will definitely be using them again! Thank you for an awesome experience!!!

Review: I placed my order on the phone. Staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the options available for me to use my birthday reward. My order was correct and ready for me to pick up at the DNT location since I was close by. The standard is FREE delivery on every order. I do recommend i Fratelli's pizza.

Review: This place is terrible, ignore the good reviews they are mostly old. Tried a new place with i Fratelli and "i" learned learned the hard way, their taste is less than bland. We ordered two pizzas, one looking like it had been caught up in F-5 twister both undercooked, the only real taste I could identify was flour. That was a waste of $42.03 and after one bit will be going into the trash. Waste of time, waste of money and hopefully won't be sick. It's raw!

Review: Pretty good thin crust pizza. Ordered the pepperoni and mushroom and ate outside at one of their patio tables with my dog. Appreciated the fast and courteous service. 

Unfortunately, the inside dining area does not exist and they don't have a soda machine. Instead, they serve cans. So it's a perfect place to grab a slice and go, or to order takeout/delivery. But it's not much of a restaurant.

I appreciated the opportunity to sit outside in the nice weather with my dog and eat some good pizza.

Review: Pizza is good, and I fratelli does it right. Ordered Delivery and it was about the normal time for it. However, the pizza and salad was worth the wait.

We got a pepperoni, marghareita, and meat pizza. All delicious, but the marghareita was my favorite one. The fresh tomatoes really brought flavor out the sauce, and the cheese was great. The pizza was a thin crust which I loved, and it was crispy. 

Finally the salad, omg. We used a little more dressing than normal, but it was perfect. I recommend the pizza here.

Review: Quick Note!!

Double check your pizza when you get it delivered. Our pizza was incorrect but I didn't catch it until we opened the box later to eat it.   It also looked like it may have sat for a while in the store before being delivered.

I contacted them but haven't heard back yet. 

Note:  we have ordered previously with no major problems.

However upon getting home and taking the first bite of disappointment I was let down! The toppings seem fresh and delicious.

Review: This location is so amazing! I called to order a couple of pizzas a few days ago and I had never called this location for delivery. I placed this order in the morning and was a bit worried it would not be here on time. However, i Fratelli definitely proved me wrong. They brought in the food on time and it was delicious! I was even more pleasantly surprised when they called me a few hours later and asked how everything was! Talk about top notch customer service! That's not even the best part. (Hard to believe) Yesterday, they sent me a ticket for a complimentary pizza! Luckily it could be used at any location and I took my ticket over to the Grapevine location near my place. I love when businesses have excellent service, not to mention great food. I will continue to be a loyal customer of i Fratelli! You will not be disappointed. Cheers to the awesome folks who are running the Plano West restaurant!

Review: I had these guys' pizza through others ordering it at events I was at, and this was my first time ordering myself. First off, as you may see from all the pictures, their pizzas are rectangular shaped and sliced into rectangular pieces as well. This leaves those crust lovers with very little crust. The topping run all way to the edge, and they don't skimp. The crust is thin and crispy. We had the Big Brother which is essentially a combo pizza and it was decent, but on the salty side, even for pizza. The bread sticks were amazing though, as the seasoning and fluffiness was perfect! 

The Plano location is just off the Tollway and Park and doesn't have seating inside, just a couple of small tables outside. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Review: I discovered this place a few weeks ago by accident, just driving in their shopping center. It has quickly become my favorite pizza place in town. In terms of taste, value, and customer experience, no other pizzeria in Dallas can touch it. I usually am helped by either Jared or Doug and they are both outstanding. Their kind of attention to detail and professionalism are more in line with a 5-star restaurant. You're treated very well here.

Also, ya know how after you eat a bunch of pizza, you usually feel kinda bloated and gross? Not here. The pizza is NOT greasy and the toppings always taste very fresh and wholesome. My favorite is the "Chef's Special" but there's plenty more to choose from.

I have experienced so many bad places in town that I feel compelled to let people know how great this place is. You won't be disappointed!

Review: Ordered a medium pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno pizza. added desserr and a side salad.  It came out to be 20.57

The pizza is thin crust and reminded me of Shakeys pizza, except Shakeys sauce has a tart kick to it.  The toppings tasted fresh, which is a plus.

The side salad only came with a standard Italian dressing, it was seriously lacking in flavor. 

The guy forgot to give me napkins or a fork with dinner. Guess I will be eating this salad with my fingers. They staple the salad paper bag but i assumed it was in there, i should've checked myself tho.

Altogether, it was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say this is a step up from dominos or pizza hut.

Review: Well I finally got around to trying this place out after much debate, and now I'm just like "what took me so long?!" I love many sorts of pizzas- especially thin crust. And the thin crust here is amazing! I ordered a simple medium thin crust pepperoni just to get a good feel for what their pizza was like. While it might not look like much, it is very filling and perfectly seasoned! They sprinkle it with a nice blend of Italian spices which puts them a step above the rest. I'll definitely be back to try out some more topping combinations! 

Fyi it's take out only (and delivery if you're in range), but there a few seats to sit and wait for your order.

Review: Got this place to deliver for a fun girls night in! Placed our order at 9, and driver had the pizza in our hands in under 30 minutes. 

Their pizza is PHENOMENAL- thin crust, fresh toppings, not doughy! Authentic Italian pizza style! They were happy to take our special make your own order and got it right! 

Good price for authentic pizza! 18 for a large with 3 toppings! Not bad for a meal for two and plenty of leftovers !

Review: I have a Yelp account but I don't normally post on here like I should because well...life happens and too much time passes and the review never gets posted. This time, I felt it was imperative to make sure I post this. This store has the MOST impressive customer service from the GM, Jarret to Chuck, who will probably be the one you talk to when you call.   The pizza is just as awesome as the crew that makes it. The toppings are so fresh and they are not shy with them!  It's the kinda pizza you daydream about when you're watching calories during the week lol. Love their house salad as well. Exceptional product and customer service - you can't ask for more.

Review: Ordered the veggie lovers pizza.  First, delivery was very fast.  They said an hour, seemed more like 20 mins.
The pizza itself was very disappointing.  Should have just bought some olives at the store since that's pretty much what the pizza tasted like.  Couldn't taste cheese or sauce, just waaaayy to many olives, overwhelmingly so.  Ate a slice and tossed it, waste of $28.  Digiornio next time.

Review: So me and my office compatriot's just finished scarfing down two large pizzas, some bread sticks, and a salad. There were four of us working on it all and we ended up leaving just about 1/2 a pizza in the work fridge for whomever forgets their lunch tomorrow. Overall, I cant say its the best pizza around, I reserve that for thick crust, deep dish, overloaded with cheese and toppings pizza, but it was pretty good. 

We had the Big Brother, which was truly loaded down with toppings and cheese, and a two topping of our own creation. They win points, because their mushrooms are fresh, not canned, and they provide little packets of pepper and cheese with the order. On our own creation, we did halves of Jalapenos and Pineapple with Pepperoni (not on the same side) and it wasn't lacking for toppings in my opinion. 

The pizza was oblong (like a football) and the middle was done perfectly, but the outer edge was a bit too black for my tastes. It had a great crispness that reminded me of one of my favorite places back home, but lost a star with the excess char on the edges. The bread sticks were good, nothing special, but with only 3 to an order (it seemed like an odd, pun intended, number to put in an order) we were left splitting them up between the four of us. 

For office delivery, they were very prompt and accommodating, seeing as we are on the outside edge of their delivery area...They said 30-45 minutes and it was here in 35....definitely helped their rating and future business from this office crew. 

Overall, we'd probably do it again if only because they delivered and were prompt with the order. It was a great value, using a buy one get one free coupon they offered for joining their e-club, at only 6 bucks a person (including tip).

Review: I really really like this place. When they first opened the Greenville location, they offered to bring my office of 7 people free lunch. I thought this would include 2 large pizzas or something. WRONG. They showed up with three huge pizzas, salads for everyone, dessert, and paper plates/napkins/utensils. How awesome! We ordered from them many times afterwards and enjoyed it each time. I've also ordered from the Plano location and it seems pretty consistent.

This is my new favorite pizza delivery. They are generous with toppings and the crust is delicious. I recommend ordering the pizza well done and with extra sauce. The extra sauce put it over the edge for me and made for a finger licking good pizza! The meat lover's pizza was a little OTT. I enjoy the veggie, or a simple pepperoni more.
I have had the salad, and while it only really comes with lettuce, one or two olives, and a pickled pepper (like Papa John's) the italian dressing is YUMMY! I thought I wouldn't care for the salad when I saw that it was just lettuce, but it was so good I finished every bite.

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! You won't regret it :)

Review: Great service and absolutely delicious. We ordered delivery, using a coupon on the website for a large 3-topping, breadsticks and two house salads ($18.95 or something thereabouts). 

Delivery came quickly, under 30 minutes. We went with hamburger, fresh basil and black olives. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the pie was piled with ground beef (reminded me of my Midwestern roots, where pizza parlors would season and fry a pound of meat and load it up) - no sparse toppings here. Every bite had crumbled beef, enough olives to taste but not overwhelm, and fragrant fresh basil. They really did not skimp on anything. The pizza was very balanced with a good ratio of crust, toppings, sauce. I personally love thin crust, so I was a happy camper. My husband tends toward thick/deep dish, but he agreed this was super good and wanted to know when we could order it again.

The house salad was essentially romaine (and maybe some iceberg) lettuce topped with fresh green onions. The house dressing was a delicious Italian, rich and balanced. It was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the pizza.

Incidentally, the delivery driver neglected our breadsticks. We tried to call her really quick after she left, just in case she was still in our apartment lot and could just turn around. She didn't answer, so we called the store to see if maybe they could get her before she got too far away. We weren't really stressing the breadsticks, if we didn't get them it wasn't a big deal, but we thought we'd try anyway. 

Crazy good customer service. When I called the store, I was referred to the manager who apologized profusely, said they would send the breadsticks right back out - and would comp the entire meal!! Holy smokes! We really were impressed. That's incredibly generous for just a missed order of breadsticks, and we will definitely order again. 

By the way, the breadsticks were thick, warm and covered in cheese. I was slowly nodding off from my food coma, but still ate one and a half of them dipped in marinara. Later I passed out. And mumbled things to myself about the sweet pizza.

I got pepperoni  and sausage. It was so hot and fresh- my sneaky urgency didn't allow me to take a bite without the roof of my mouth being set on fire. I waited to devour the rest at home. 

Enjoyed the flavor, the taste, the Roxie and the kindness. 
Check them out.

Review: I wanted pizza today so one of my friends recommended this place to me. Y'all I have lived over here for almost 10 years and I just can't believe I've never tried them. When I walked in the gentleman at the front was very friendly and welcoming which is def a plus for me. 
I ordered online because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and hamburger on it and it was just amazing. I believe all the pizzas come in a flatbread style which tasted amazing but horrible for me cause I almost ate the whole pizza by myself . I actually want to order again today but imma have self control and wait till next week. 
If you needed a sign to go here it is , Go now and try them out.

After 45, we called to inquire and were told it was "on the heat rack", but they wee still waiting for the delivery person to return and would be at least another 10-15 minutes.  Great!  The pizza will be under the heat lamp for 25 minutes!  Now my husband is just going to pick it up.  So glad we already tipped!  Trying somewhere else next time!

Review: I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. The two pizza's we got were burned on the thin crust. The breadsticks were burned on the bottom and tasted old. The salads were ok. The reason I even gave this place 2 stars is because their ranch dressing was pretty good. But if you want pizza that tastes like Dominoes, get it from here becuase that's what it reminded me of. Dominoes is cheaper tho.

Review: This location has become the go-to for pizza catering at our office. They provide great service, and the food is definitely top notch. Recently, we had an issue with an order; specifically, it arrived late to our office. i Fratelli promised to make it right, and they were able to resolve the issue to our satisfaction with some great followup service, going above and beyond our expectations. 

But what of the food? i Fratelli specializes in thin crust pies, shaped like an oval, but with straight sides. They're cut into thin strips, making it easy for trying multiple flavors if you have several available, and minimizing waste. I've tried almost every standard flavor that they offer, and they're all delicious. The Big Brother (supreme) is definitely a favorite, striking a great balance between meat and vegetable toppings. The Carne Classico will fill all of your meat cravings, with delicious, big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, hamburger, and more. They also make a mean margherita for those who like to keep it simple. 

Dine in or to go, i Fratelli will (wait for it) deliver :)

Review: Well I finally got around to trying this place out after much debate, and now I'm just like "what took me so long?!" I love many sorts of pizzas- especially thin crust. And the thin crust here is amazing! I ordered a simple medium thin crust pepperoni just to get a good feel for what their pizza was like. While it might not look like much, it is very filling and perfectly seasoned! They sprinkle it with a nice blend of Italian spices which puts them a step above the rest. I'll definitely be back to try out some more topping combinations! 

Fyi it's take out only (and delivery if you're in range), but there a few seats to sit and wait for your order.

Review: Got this place to deliver for a fun girls night in! Placed our order at 9, and driver had the pizza in our hands in under 30 minutes. 

Their pizza is PHENOMENAL- thin crust, fresh toppings, not doughy! Authentic Italian pizza style! They were happy to take our special make your own order and got it right! 

Good price for authentic pizza! 18 for a large with 3 toppings! Not bad for a meal for two and plenty of leftovers !

Review: I have a Yelp account but I don't normally post on here like I should because well...life happens and too much time passes and the review never gets posted. This time, I felt it was imperative to make sure I post this. This store has the MOST impressive customer service from the GM, Jarret to Chuck, who will probably be the one you talk to when you call.   The pizza is just as awesome as the crew that makes it. The toppings are so fresh and they are not shy with them!  It's the kinda pizza you daydream about when you're watching calories during the week lol. Love their house salad as well. Exceptional product and customer service - you can't ask for more.

Review: Ordered the veggie lovers pizza.  First, delivery was very fast.  They said an hour, seemed more like 20 mins.
The pizza itself was very disappointing.  Should have just bought some olives at the store since that's pretty much what the pizza tasted like.  Couldn't taste cheese or sauce, just waaaayy to many olives, overwhelmingly so.  Ate a slice and tossed it, waste of $28.  Digiornio next time.

Review: So me and my office compatriot's just finished scarfing down two large pizzas, some bread sticks, and a salad. There were four of us working on it all and we ended up leaving just about 1/2 a pizza in the work fridge for whomever forgets their lunch tomorrow. Overall, I cant say its the best pizza around, I reserve that for thick crust, deep dish, overloaded with cheese and toppings pizza, but it was pretty good. 

We had the Big Brother, which was truly loaded down with toppings and cheese, and a two topping of our own creation. They win points, because their mushrooms are fresh, not canned, and they provide little packets of pepper and cheese with the order. On our own creation, we did halves of Jalapenos and Pineapple with Pepperoni (not on the same side) and it wasn't lacking for toppings in my opinion. 

The pizza was oblong (like a football) and the middle was done perfectly, but the outer edge was a bit too black for my tastes. It had a great crispness that reminded me of one of my favorite places back home, but lost a star with the excess char on the edges. The bread sticks were good, nothing special, but with only 3 to an order (it seemed like an odd, pun intended, number to put in an order) we were left splitting them up between the four of us. 

For office delivery, they were very prompt and accommodating, seeing as we are on the outside edge of their delivery area...They said 30-45 minutes and it was here in 35....definitely helped their rating and future business from this office crew. 

Overall, we'd probably do it again if only because they delivered and were prompt with the order. It was a great value, using a buy one get one free coupon they offered for joining their e-club, at only 6 bucks a person (including tip).

Review: I really really like this place. When they first opened the Greenville location, they offered to bring my office of 7 people free lunch. I thought this would include 2 large pizzas or something. WRONG. They showed up with three huge pizzas, salads for everyone, dessert, and paper plates/napkins/utensils. How awesome! We ordered from them many times afterwards and enjoyed it each time. I've also ordered from the Plano location and it seems pretty consistent.

This is my new favorite pizza delivery. They are generous with toppings and the crust is delicious. I recommend ordering the pizza well done and with extra sauce. The extra sauce put it over the edge for me and made for a finger licking good pizza! The meat lover's pizza was a little OTT. I enjoy the veggie, or a simple pepperoni more.
I have had the salad, and while it only really comes with lettuce, one or two olives, and a pickled pepper (like Papa John's) the italian dressing is YUMMY! I thought I wouldn't care for the salad when I saw that it was just lettuce, but it was so good I finished every bite.

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! You won't regret it :)

Review: Great service and absolutely delicious. We ordered delivery, using a coupon on the website for a large 3-topping, breadsticks and two house salads ($18.95 or something thereabouts). 

Delivery came quickly, under 30 minutes. We went with hamburger, fresh basil and black olives. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the pie was piled with ground beef (reminded me of my Midwestern roots, where pizza parlors would season and fry a pound of meat and load it up) - no sparse toppings here. Every bite had crumbled beef, enough olives to taste but not overwhelm, and fragrant fresh basil. They really did not skimp on anything. The pizza was very balanced with a good ratio of crust, toppings, sauce. I personally love thin crust, so I was a happy camper. My husband tends toward thick/deep dish, but he agreed this was super good and wanted to know when we could order it again.

The house salad was essentially romaine (and maybe some iceberg) lettuce topped with fresh green onions. The house dressing was a delicious Italian, rich and balanced. It was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the pizza.

Incidentally, the delivery driver neglected our breadsticks. We tried to call her really quick after she left, just in case she was still in our apartment lot and could just turn around. She didn't answer, so we called the store to see if maybe they could get her before she got too far away. We weren't really stressing the breadsticks, if we didn't get them it wasn't a big deal, but we thought we'd try anyway. 

Crazy good customer service. When I called the store, I was referred to the manager who apologized profusely, said they would send the breadsticks right back out - and would comp the entire meal!! Holy smokes! We really were impressed. That's incredibly generous for just a missed order of breadsticks, and we will definitely order again. 

By the way, the breadsticks were thick, warm and covered in cheese. I was slowly nodding off from my food coma, but still ate one and a half of them dipped in marinara. Later I passed out. And mumbled things to myself about the sweet pizza.

Review: I wanted pizza today so one of my friends recommended this place to me. Y'all I have lived over here for almost 10 years and I just can't believe I've never tried them. When I walked in the gentleman at the front was very friendly and welcoming which is def a plus for me. 
I ordered online because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and hamburger on it and it was just amazing. I believe all the pizzas come in a flatbread style which tasted amazing but horrible for me cause I almost ate the whole pizza by myself . I actually want to order again today but imma have self control and wait till next week. 
If you needed a sign to go here it is , Go now and try them out.

Review: We orderd and it was estimated for 34 minues.  After 45, we called to inquire and were told it was "on the heat rack", but they wee still waiting for the delivery person to return and would be at least another 10-15 minutes.  Great!  The pizza will be under the heat lamp for 25 minutes!  Now my husband is just going to pick it up.  So glad we already tipped!  Trying somewhere else next time!

Review: NEVER TRUST A BURNT PIZZA

Beyond dissapointing and completely unacceptable to even attempt to serve something like this to a customer as you had to have seen how this pizza came out of the oven firsthand and yet you chose to still deliver it to our family. I truly have no words...(photo attached)

Review: I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. The two pizza's we got were burned on the thin crust. The breadsticks were burned on the bottom and tasted old. The salads were ok. The reason I even gave this place 2 stars is because their ranch dressing was pretty good. But if you want pizza that tastes like Dominoes, get it from here becuase that's what it reminded me of. Dominoes is cheaper tho.

Review: This location has become the go-to for pizza catering at our office. They provide great service, and the food is definitely top notch. Recently, we had an issue with an order; specifically, it arrived late to our office. i Fratelli promised to make it right, and they were able to resolve the issue to our satisfaction with some great followup service, going above and beyond our expectations. 

But what of the food? i Fratelli specializes in thin crust pies, shaped like an oval, but with straight sides. They're cut into thin strips, making it easy for trying multiple flavors if you have several available, and minimizing waste. I've tried almost every standard flavor that they offer, and they're all delicious. The Big Brother (supreme) is definitely a favorite, striking a great balance between meat and vegetable toppings. The Carne Classico will fill all of your meat cravings, with delicious, big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, hamburger, and more. They also make a mean margherita for those who like to keep it simple. 

Dine in or to go, i Fratelli will (wait for it) deliver :)

Review: LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza. Always on time when I've ordered for large pick up orders. Always have the order correct. Great service. Generous toppings! my favorite is extra sauce, extra olives on the vegetarian but the BIG brother is amazing if you like meat! This is the best pizza if you enjoy thin crust. Salads are great too. I've ordered for office party catering and still amazing. GREAT JOB!!! GREAT PIZZA!

Review: Customer service and food quality is the BEST! Ordered a few pizzas and a salad for a staff meeting... the salad was incredibly fresh and huge(Caesar that feeds 10+)! Every pizza was fresh and tasty! My employees were impressed with the gluten free option. Matthew followed up with us to see how our order was... what pizza place does that?! His customer service and kindness was above and beyond. We will definitely be using them again! Thank you for an awesome experience!!!

Review: This place is terrible, ignore the good reviews they are mostly old. Tried a new place with i Fratelli and "i" learned learned the hard way, their taste is less than bland. We ordered two pizzas, one looking like it had been caught up in F-5 twister both undercooked, the only real taste I could identify was flour. That was a waste of $42.03 and after one bit will be going into the trash. Waste of time, waste of money and hopefully won't be sick. It's raw!

Review: Pretty good thin crust pizza. Ordered the pepperoni and mushroom and ate outside at one of their patio tables with my dog. Appreciated the fast and courteous service. 

Unfortunately, the inside dining area does not exist and they don't have a soda machine. Instead, they serve cans. So it's a perfect place to grab a slice and go, or to order takeout/delivery. But it's not much of a restaurant.

I appreciated the opportunity to sit outside in the nice weather with my dog and eat some good pizza.

Review: Pizza is good, and I fratelli does it right. Ordered Delivery and it was about the normal time for it. However, the pizza and salad was worth the wait.

We got a pepperoni, marghareita, and meat pizza. All delicious, but the marghareita was my favorite one. The fresh tomatoes really brought flavor out the sauce, and the cheese was great. The pizza was a thin crust which I loved, and it was crispy. 

Finally the salad, omg. We used a little more dressing than normal, but it was perfect. I recommend the pizza here.

Review: I rarely eat pizza and when cravings kick in I long for a GOOD, nice delicious well prepared pizza! First time customer definitely not my last time either.

I hate that it too so long for me to know this place but now that I know am hooked.

Review: Quick Note!!

Double check your pizza when you get it delivered. Our pizza was incorrect but I didn't catch it until we opened the box later to eat it.   It also looked like it may have sat for a while in the store before being delivered.

I contacted them but haven't heard back yet. 

Note:  we have ordered previously with no major problems.

Review: Well after all the hoopla it wasn't as great as they said. The customer service was good. Very polite and cordial. The wait was reasonable as well. However upon getting home and taking the first bite of disappointment I was let down! The toppings seem fresh and delicious. The crust however was cooked longer than needed it seems and the burnt crust taste ruined it for me! So I'll definitely have to bring this to their attention on the next visit. I love pizza so I'll do a second chance!

The first seemed truly interested in my order and very personable. The latter was genuinely in good spirits and mind you, it was pouring down rain, and was most gracious. My Order was correct and the pizza... delicious!  Do yourself a favor and Order your next pizza from i Fratelli Pizza.

Review: This location is so amazing! I called to order a couple of pizzas a few days ago and I had never called this location for delivery. I placed this order in the morning and was a bit worried it would not be here on time. However, i Fratelli definitely proved me wrong. They brought in the food on time and it was delicious! I was even more pleasantly surprised when they called me a few hours later and asked how everything was! Talk about top notch customer service! That's not even the best part. (Hard to believe) Yesterday, they sent me a ticket for a complimentary pizza! Luckily it could be used at any location and I took my ticket over to the Grapevine location near my place. I love when businesses have excellent service, not to mention great food. I will continue to be a loyal customer of i Fratelli! You will not be disappointed. Cheers to the awesome folks who are running the Plano West restaurant!

Review: I had these guys' pizza through others ordering it at events I was at, and this was my first time ordering myself. First off, as you may see from all the pictures, their pizzas are rectangular shaped and sliced into rectangular pieces as well. This leaves those crust lovers with very little crust. The topping run all way to the edge, and they don't skimp. The crust is thin and crispy. We had the Big Brother which is essentially a combo pizza and it was decent, but on the salty side, even for pizza. The bread sticks were amazing though, as the seasoning and fluffiness was perfect! 

The Plano location is just off the Tollway and Park and doesn't have seating inside, just a couple of small tables outside. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Review: I discovered this place a few weeks ago by accident, just driving in their shopping center. It has quickly become my favorite pizza place in town. In terms of taste, value, and customer experience, no other pizzeria in Dallas can touch it. I usually am helped by either Jared or Doug and they are both outstanding. Their kind of attention to detail and professionalism are more in line with a 5-star restaurant. You're treated very well here.

Also, ya know how after you eat a bunch of pizza, you usually feel kinda bloated and gross? Not here. The pizza is NOT greasy and the toppings always taste very fresh and wholesome. My favorite is the "Chef's Special" but there's plenty more to choose from.

I have experienced so many bad places in town that I feel compelled to let people know how great this place is. You won't be disappointed!

Review: Ordered a medium pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno pizza. added desserr and a side salad.  It came out to be 20.57

The pizza is thin crust and reminded me of Shakeys pizza, except Shakeys sauce has a tart kick to it.  The toppings tasted fresh, which is a plus.

The side salad only came with a standard Italian dressing, it was seriously lacking in flavor. 

The guy forgot to give me napkins or a fork with dinner. Guess I will be eating this salad with my fingers. They staple the salad paper bag but i assumed it was in there, i should've checked myself tho.

Altogether, it was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say this is a step up from dominos or pizza hut.

Review: I wanted pizza today so one of my friends recommended this place to me. Y'all I have lived over here for almost 10 years and I just can't believe I've never tried them. When I walked in the gentleman at the front was very friendly and welcoming which is def a plus for me. 
I ordered online because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and hamburger on it and it was just amazing. I believe all the pizzas come in a flatbread style which tasted amazing but horrible for me cause I almost ate the whole pizza by myself . I actually want to order again today but imma have self control and wait till next week. 
If you needed a sign to go here it is , Go now and try them out.

Review: We orderd and it was estimated for 34 minues.  After 45, we called to inquire and were told it was "on the heat rack", but they wee still waiting for the delivery person to return and would be at least another 10-15 minutes.  Great!  The pizza will be under the heat lamp for 25 minutes!  Now my husband is just going to pick it up.  So glad we already tipped!  Trying somewhere else next time!

Review: Always love fratellis, however this time I was a bit disappointed. 
I ordered a half pepperoni, half sausage large pizza.  The slices only had 3/4 of the toppings on each side.
The center of the pizza was just cheeses on both ends.
Disappointed.

Review: I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. The two pizza's we got were burned on the thin crust. The breadsticks were burned on the bottom and tasted old. The salads were ok. The reason I even gave this place 2 stars is because their ranch dressing was pretty good. But if you want pizza that tastes like Dominoes, get it from here becuase that's what it reminded me of. Dominoes is cheaper tho.

Review: This location has become the go-to for pizza catering at our office. They provide great service, and the food is definitely top notch. Recently, we had an issue with an order; specifically, it arrived late to our office. i Fratelli promised to make it right, and they were able to resolve the issue to our satisfaction with some great followup service, going above and beyond our expectations. 

But what of the food? i Fratelli specializes in thin crust pies, shaped like an oval, but with straight sides. They're cut into thin strips, making it easy for trying multiple flavors if you have several available, and minimizing waste. I've tried almost every standard flavor that they offer, and they're all delicious. The Big Brother (supreme) is definitely a favorite, striking a great balance between meat and vegetable toppings. The Carne Classico will fill all of your meat cravings, with delicious, big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, hamburger, and more. They also make a mean margherita for those who like to keep it simple. 

Dine in or to go, i Fratelli will (wait for it) deliver :)

Review: LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza. Always on time when I've ordered for large pick up orders. Always have the order correct. Great service. Generous toppings! my favorite is extra sauce, extra olives on the vegetarian but the BIG brother is amazing if you like meat! This is the best pizza if you enjoy thin crust. Salads are great too. I've ordered for office party catering and still amazing. GREAT JOB!!! GREAT PIZZA!

We ordered two pizzas, one looking like it had been caught up in F-5 twister both undercooked, the only real taste I could identify was flour. That was a waste of $42.03 and after one bit will be going into the trash. Waste of time, waste of money and hopefully won't be sick. It's raw!

Review: Pretty good thin crust pizza. Ordered the pepperoni and mushroom and ate outside at one of their patio tables with my dog. Appreciated the fast and courteous service. 

Unfortunately, the inside dining area does not exist and they don't have a soda machine. Instead, they serve cans. So it's a perfect place to grab a slice and go, or to order takeout/delivery. But it's not much of a restaurant.

I appreciated the opportunity to sit outside in the nice weather with my dog and eat some good pizza.

Review: Pizza is good, and I fratelli does it right. Ordered Delivery and it was about the normal time for it. However, the pizza and salad was worth the wait.

Review: Quick Note!!

Double check your pizza when you get it delivered. Our pizza was incorrect but I didn't catch it until we opened the box later to eat it.   It also looked like it may have sat for a while in the store before being delivered.

I contacted them but haven't heard back yet.

However upon getting home and taking the first bite of disappointment I was let down! The toppings seem fresh and delicious.

Review: This location is so amazing! I called to order a couple of pizzas a few days ago and I had never called this location for delivery. I placed this order in the morning and was a bit worried it would not be here on time. However, i Fratelli definitely proved me wrong. They brought in the food on time and it was delicious! I was even more pleasantly surprised when they called me a few hours later and asked how everything was! Talk about top notch customer service! That's not even the best part. (Hard to believe) Yesterday, they sent me a ticket for a complimentary pizza! Luckily it could be used at any location and I took my ticket over to the Grapevine location near my place. I love when businesses have excellent service, not to mention great food. I will continue to be a loyal customer of i Fratelli! You will not be disappointed. Cheers to the awesome folks who are running the Plano West restaurant!

Review: I had these guys' pizza through others ordering it at events I was at, and this was my first time ordering myself. First off, as you may see from all the pictures, their pizzas are rectangular shaped and sliced into rectangular pieces as well. This leaves those crust lovers with very little crust. The topping run all way to the edge, and they don't skimp. The crust is thin and crispy. We had the Big Brother which is essentially a combo pizza and it was decent, but on the salty side, even for pizza. The bread sticks were amazing though, as the seasoning and fluffiness was perfect! 

The Plano location is just off the Tollway and Park and doesn't have seating inside, just a couple of small tables outside. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Review: I discovered this place a few weeks ago by accident, just driving in their shopping center. It has quickly become my favorite pizza place in town. In terms of taste, value, and customer experience, no other pizzeria in Dallas can touch it. I usually am helped by either Jared or Doug and they are both outstanding. Their kind of attention to detail and professionalism are more in line with a 5-star restaurant. You're treated very well here.

Also, ya know how after you eat a bunch of pizza, you usually feel kinda bloated and gross? Not here. The pizza is NOT greasy and the toppings always taste very fresh and wholesome. My favorite is the "Chef's Special" but there's plenty more to choose from.

I have experienced so many bad places in town that I feel compelled to let people know how great this place is. You won't be disappointed!

Review: Ordered a medium pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno pizza. added desserr and a side salad.  It came out to be 20.57

The pizza is thin crust and reminded me of Shakeys pizza, except Shakeys sauce has a tart kick to it.  The toppings tasted fresh, which is a plus.

The side salad only came with a standard Italian dressing, it was seriously lacking in flavor. 

The guy forgot to give me napkins or a fork with dinner. Guess I will be eating this salad with my fingers. They staple the salad paper bag but i assumed it was in there, i should've checked myself tho.

Altogether, it was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say this is a step up from dominos or pizza hut.

Review: Well I finally got around to trying this place out after much debate, and now I'm just like "what took me so long?!" I love many sorts of pizzas- especially thin crust. And the thin crust here is amazing! I ordered a simple medium thin crust pepperoni just to get a good feel for what their pizza was like. While it might not look like much, it is very filling and perfectly seasoned! They sprinkle it with a nice blend of Italian spices which puts them a step above the rest. I'll definitely be back to try out some more topping combinations! 

Fyi it's take out only (and delivery if you're in range), but there a few seats to sit and wait for your order.

Review: Got this place to deliver for a fun girls night in! Placed our order at 9, and driver had the pizza in our hands in under 30 minutes. 

Their pizza is PHENOMENAL- thin crust, fresh toppings, not doughy! Authentic Italian pizza style! They were happy to take our special make your own order and got it right! 

Good price for authentic pizza! 18 for a large with 3 toppings! Not bad for a meal for two and plenty of leftovers !

Review: I have a Yelp account but I don't normally post on here like I should because well...life happens and too much time passes and the review never gets posted. This time, I felt it was imperative to make sure I post this. This store has the MOST impressive customer service from the GM, Jarret to Chuck, who will probably be the one you talk to when you call.   The pizza is just as awesome as the crew that makes it. The toppings are so fresh and they are not shy with them!  It's the kinda pizza you daydream about when you're watching calories during the week lol. Love their house salad as well. Exceptional product and customer service - you can't ask for more.

Review: Ordered the veggie lovers pizza.  First, delivery was very fast.  They said an hour, seemed more like 20 mins.
The pizza itself was very disappointing.  Should have just bought some olives at the store since that's pretty much what the pizza tasted like.  Couldn't taste cheese or sauce, just waaaayy to many olives, overwhelmingly so.  Ate a slice and tossed it, waste of $28.  Digiornio next time.

Review: So me and my office compatriot's just finished scarfing down two large pizzas, some bread sticks, and a salad. There were four of us working on it all and we ended up leaving just about 1/2 a pizza in the work fridge for whomever forgets their lunch tomorrow. Overall, I cant say its the best pizza around, I reserve that for thick crust, deep dish, overloaded with cheese and toppings pizza, but it was pretty good. 

We had the Big Brother, which was truly loaded down with toppings and cheese, and a two topping of our own creation. They win points, because their mushrooms are fresh, not canned, and they provide little packets of pepper and cheese with the order. On our own creation, we did halves of Jalapenos and Pineapple with Pepperoni (not on the same side) and it wasn't lacking for toppings in my opinion. 

The pizza was oblong (like a football) and the middle was done perfectly, but the outer edge was a bit too black for my tastes. It had a great crispness that reminded me of one of my favorite places back home, but lost a star with the excess char on the edges. The bread sticks were good, nothing special, but with only 3 to an order (it seemed like an odd, pun intended, number to put in an order) we were left splitting them up between the four of us. 

For office delivery, they were very prompt and accommodating, seeing as we are on the outside edge of their delivery area...They said 30-45 minutes and it was here in 35....definitely helped their rating and future business from this office crew. 

Overall, we'd probably do it again if only because they delivered and were prompt with the order. It was a great value, using a buy one get one free coupon they offered for joining their e-club, at only 6 bucks a person (including tip).

Review: I really really like this place. When they first opened the Greenville location, they offered to bring my office of 7 people free lunch. I thought this would include 2 large pizzas or something. WRONG. They showed up with three huge pizzas, salads for everyone, dessert, and paper plates/napkins/utensils. How awesome! We ordered from them many times afterwards and enjoyed it each time. I've also ordered from the Plano location and it seems pretty consistent.

This is my new favorite pizza delivery. They are generous with toppings and the crust is delicious. I recommend ordering the pizza well done and with extra sauce. The extra sauce put it over the edge for me and made for a finger licking good pizza! The meat lover's pizza was a little OTT. I enjoy the veggie, or a simple pepperoni more.
I have had the salad, and while it only really comes with lettuce, one or two olives, and a pickled pepper (like Papa John's) the italian dressing is YUMMY! I thought I wouldn't care for the salad when I saw that it was just lettuce, but it was so good I finished every bite.

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! You won't regret it :)

Review: Great service and absolutely delicious. We ordered delivery, using a coupon on the website for a large 3-topping, breadsticks and two house salads ($18.95 or something thereabouts). 

Delivery came quickly, under 30 minutes. We went with hamburger, fresh basil and black olives. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the pie was piled with ground beef (reminded me of my Midwestern roots, where pizza parlors would season and fry a pound of meat and load it up) - no sparse toppings here. Every bite had crumbled beef, enough olives to taste but not overwhelm, and fragrant fresh basil. They really did not skimp on anything. The pizza was very balanced with a good ratio of crust, toppings, sauce. I personally love thin crust, so I was a happy camper. My husband tends toward thick/deep dish, but he agreed this was super good and wanted to know when we could order it again.

The house salad was essentially romaine (and maybe some iceberg) lettuce topped with fresh green onions. The house dressing was a delicious Italian, rich and balanced. It was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the pizza.

Incidentally, the delivery driver neglected our breadsticks. We tried to call her really quick after she left, just in case she was still in our apartment lot and could just turn around. She didn't answer, so we called the store to see if maybe they could get her before she got too far away. We weren't really stressing the breadsticks, if we didn't get them it wasn't a big deal, but we thought we'd try anyway. 

Crazy good customer service. When I called the store, I was referred to the manager who apologized profusely, said they would send the breadsticks right back out - and would comp the entire meal!! Holy smokes! We really were impressed. That's incredibly generous for just a missed order of breadsticks, and we will definitely order again. 

By the way, the breadsticks were thick, warm and covered in cheese. I was slowly nodding off from my food coma, but still ate one and a half of them dipped in marinara. Later I passed out. And mumbled things to myself about the sweet pizza.

My Order was correct and the pizza... delicious!  Do yourself a favor and Order your next pizza from i Fratelli Pizza.

Review: I ordered online for pick-up and was not disappointed, I got a large margherita and vegetarian. It's on the more expensive side for takeout or delivery pizza but the quality is definitely worth it! They add plenty of toppings and the staff was very friendly, 10/10 can't wait to order from them again.

Review: This location is so amazing! I called to order a couple of pizzas a few days ago and I had never called this location for delivery. I placed this order in the morning and was a bit worried it would not be here on time. However, i Fratelli definitely proved me wrong. They brought in the food on time and it was delicious! I was even more pleasantly surprised when they called me a few hours later and asked how everything was! Talk about top notch customer service! That's not even the best part. (Hard to believe) Yesterday, they sent me a ticket for a complimentary pizza! Luckily it could be used at any location and I took my ticket over to the Grapevine location near my place. I love when businesses have excellent service, not to mention great food. I will continue to be a loyal customer of i Fratelli! You will not be disappointed. Cheers to the awesome folks who are running the Plano West restaurant!

Review: I had these guys' pizza through others ordering it at events I was at, and this was my first time ordering myself. First off, as you may see from all the pictures, their pizzas are rectangular shaped and sliced into rectangular pieces as well. This leaves those crust lovers with very little crust. The topping run all way to the edge, and they don't skimp. The crust is thin and crispy. We had the Big Brother which is essentially a combo pizza and it was decent, but on the salty side, even for pizza. The bread sticks were amazing though, as the seasoning and fluffiness was perfect! 

The Plano location is just off the Tollway and Park and doesn't have seating inside, just a couple of small tables outside. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Review: I discovered this place a few weeks ago by accident, just driving in their shopping center. It has quickly become my favorite pizza place in town. In terms of taste, value, and customer experience, no other pizzeria in Dallas can touch it. I usually am helped by either Jared or Doug and they are both outstanding. Their kind of attention to detail and professionalism are more in line with a 5-star restaurant. You're treated very well here.

Also, ya know how after you eat a bunch of pizza, you usually feel kinda bloated and gross? Not here. The pizza is NOT greasy and the toppings always taste very fresh and wholesome. My favorite is the "Chef's Special" but there's plenty more to choose from.

I have experienced so many bad places in town that I feel compelled to let people know how great this place is. You won't be disappointed!

Review: Ordered a medium pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno pizza. added desserr and a side salad.  It came out to be 20.57

The pizza is thin crust and reminded me of Shakeys pizza, except Shakeys sauce has a tart kick to it.  The toppings tasted fresh, which is a plus.

The side salad only came with a standard Italian dressing, it was seriously lacking in flavor. 

The guy forgot to give me napkins or a fork with dinner. Guess I will be eating this salad with my fingers. They staple the salad paper bag but i assumed it was in there, i should've checked myself tho.

Altogether, it was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say this is a step up from dominos or pizza hut.

Review: Well I finally got around to trying this place out after much debate, and now I'm just like "what took me so long?!" I love many sorts of pizzas- especially thin crust. And the thin crust here is amazing! I ordered a simple medium thin crust pepperoni just to get a good feel for what their pizza was like. While it might not look like much, it is very filling and perfectly seasoned! They sprinkle it with a nice blend of Italian spices which puts them a step above the rest. I'll definitely be back to try out some more topping combinations! 

Fyi it's take out only (and delivery if you're in range), but there a few seats to sit and wait for your order.

Review: Got this place to deliver for a fun girls night in! Placed our order at 9, and driver had the pizza in our hands in under 30 minutes. 

Their pizza is PHENOMENAL- thin crust, fresh toppings, not doughy! Authentic Italian pizza style! They were happy to take our special make your own order and got it right! 

Good price for authentic pizza! 18 for a large with 3 toppings! Not bad for a meal for two and plenty of leftovers !

This time, I felt it was imperative to make sure I post this. This store has the MOST impressive customer service from the GM, Jarret to Chuck, who will probably be the one you talk to when you call.   The pizza is just as awesome as the crew that makes it.

Review: Ordered the veggie lovers pizza.  First, delivery was very fast.  They said an hour, seemed more like 20 mins.
The pizza itself was very disappointing.  Should have just bought some olives at the store since that's pretty much what the pizza tasted like.  Couldn't taste cheese or sauce, just waaaayy to many olives, overwhelmingly so.  Ate a slice and tossed it, waste of $28.  Digiornio next time.

Review: So me and my office compatriot's just finished scarfing down two large pizzas, some bread sticks, and a salad. There were four of us working on it all and we ended up leaving just about 1/2 a pizza in the work fridge for whomever forgets their lunch tomorrow. Overall, I cant say its the best pizza around, I reserve that for thick crust, deep dish, overloaded with cheese and toppings pizza, but it was pretty good. 

We had the Big Brother, which was truly loaded down with toppings and cheese, and a two topping of our own creation. They win points, because their mushrooms are fresh, not canned, and they provide little packets of pepper and cheese with the order. On our own creation, we did halves of Jalapenos and Pineapple with Pepperoni (not on the same side) and it wasn't lacking for toppings in my opinion. 

The pizza was oblong (like a football) and the middle was done perfectly, but the outer edge was a bit too black for my tastes. It had a great crispness that reminded me of one of my favorite places back home, but lost a star with the excess char on the edges. The bread sticks were good, nothing special, but with only 3 to an order (it seemed like an odd, pun intended, number to put in an order) we were left splitting them up between the four of us. 

For office delivery, they were very prompt and accommodating, seeing as we are on the outside edge of their delivery area...They said 30-45 minutes and it was here in 35....definitely helped their rating and future business from this office crew. 

Overall, we'd probably do it again if only because they delivered and were prompt with the order. It was a great value, using a buy one get one free coupon they offered for joining their e-club, at only 6 bucks a person (including tip).

Review: I really really like this place. When they first opened the Greenville location, they offered to bring my office of 7 people free lunch. I thought this would include 2 large pizzas or something. WRONG. They showed up with three huge pizzas, salads for everyone, dessert, and paper plates/napkins/utensils. How awesome! We ordered from them many times afterwards and enjoyed it each time. I've also ordered from the Plano location and it seems pretty consistent.

This is my new favorite pizza delivery. They are generous with toppings and the crust is delicious. I recommend ordering the pizza well done and with extra sauce. The extra sauce put it over the edge for me and made for a finger licking good pizza! The meat lover's pizza was a little OTT. I enjoy the veggie, or a simple pepperoni more.
I have had the salad, and while it only really comes with lettuce, one or two olives, and a pickled pepper (like Papa John's) the italian dressing is YUMMY! I thought I wouldn't care for the salad when I saw that it was just lettuce, but it was so good I finished every bite.

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! You won't regret it :)

Review: Great service and absolutely delicious. We ordered delivery, using a coupon on the website for a large 3-topping, breadsticks and two house salads ($18.95 or something thereabouts). 

Delivery came quickly, under 30 minutes. We went with hamburger, fresh basil and black olives. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the pie was piled with ground beef (reminded me of my Midwestern roots, where pizza parlors would season and fry a pound of meat and load it up) - no sparse toppings here. Every bite had crumbled beef, enough olives to taste but not overwhelm, and fragrant fresh basil. They really did not skimp on anything. The pizza was very balanced with a good ratio of crust, toppings, sauce. I personally love thin crust, so I was a happy camper. My husband tends toward thick/deep dish, but he agreed this was super good and wanted to know when we could order it again.

The house salad was essentially romaine (and maybe some iceberg) lettuce topped with fresh green onions. The house dressing was a delicious Italian, rich and balanced. It was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the pizza.

Incidentally, the delivery driver neglected our breadsticks. We tried to call her really quick after she left, just in case she was still in our apartment lot and could just turn around. She didn't answer, so we called the store to see if maybe they could get her before she got too far away. We weren't really stressing the breadsticks, if we didn't get them it wasn't a big deal, but we thought we'd try anyway. 

Crazy good customer service. When I called the store, I was referred to the manager who apologized profusely, said they would send the breadsticks right back out - and would comp the entire meal!! Holy smokes! We really were impressed. That's incredibly generous for just a missed order of breadsticks, and we will definitely order again. 

By the way, the breadsticks were thick, warm and covered in cheese. I was slowly nodding off from my food coma, but still ate one and a half of them dipped in marinara. Later I passed out. And mumbled things to myself about the sweet pizza.

Review: As a medical rep with a budget, this place is my go-to. The pizza is always a hit and it's not as frowned upon like bringing Pizza Hut or Dominos.  The staff though- they are so fantastic, always have my order ready and with a smile.  Thank you for the great service!

Review: If you have never had iFratelli's pizza you are missing out. I am just happy I don't live is delivery distance or we would have it every week.

Review: Very sweet young man took my order. He was pleasant and bright, very friendly. I just wanted a slice- they have a 1/4 of a pizza for 5.99, additional for toppings. I got pepperoni  and sausage. It was so hot and fresh- my sneaky urgency didn't allow me to take a bite without the roof of my mouth being set on fire. I waited to devour the rest at home. 

Enjoyed the flavor, the taste, the Roxie and the kindness. 
Check them out.

Review: I wanted pizza today so one of my friends recommended this place to me. Y'all I have lived over here for almost 10 years and I just can't believe I've never tried them. When I walked in the gentleman at the front was very friendly and welcoming which is def a plus for me. 
I ordered online because I wasn't sure if there would be a wait. I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and hamburger on it and it was just amazing. I believe all the pizzas come in a flatbread style which tasted amazing but horrible for me cause I almost ate the whole pizza by myself . I actually want to order again today but imma have self control and wait till next week. 
If you needed a sign to go here it is , Go now and try them out.

Review: We orderd and it was estimated for 34 minues.  After 45, we called to inquire and were told it was "on the heat rack", but they wee still waiting for the delivery person to return and would be at least another 10-15 minutes.  Great!  The pizza will be under the heat lamp for 25 minutes!  Now my husband is just going to pick it up.  So glad we already tipped!  Trying somewhere else next time!

Review: NEVER TRUST A BURNT PIZZA

Review: I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. The two pizza's we got were burned on the thin crust. The breadsticks were burned on the bottom and tasted old. The salads were ok. The reason I even gave this place 2 stars is because their ranch dressing was pretty good. But if you want pizza that tastes like Dominoes, get it from here becuase that's what it reminded me of. Dominoes is cheaper tho.

Review: This location has become the go-to for pizza catering at our office. They provide great service, and the food is definitely top notch. Recently, we had an issue with an order; specifically, it arrived late to our office. i Fratelli promised to make it right, and they were able to resolve the issue to our satisfaction with some great followup service, going above and beyond our expectations. 

But what of the food? i Fratelli specializes in thin crust pies, shaped like an oval, but with straight sides. They're cut into thin strips, making it easy for trying multiple flavors if you have several available, and minimizing waste. I've tried almost every standard flavor that they offer, and they're all delicious. The Big Brother (supreme) is definitely a favorite, striking a great balance between meat and vegetable toppings. The Carne Classico will fill all of your meat cravings, with delicious, big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, hamburger, and more. They also make a mean margherita for those who like to keep it simple. 

Dine in or to go, i Fratelli will (wait for it) deliver :)

Review: LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza. Always on time when I've ordered for large pick up orders. Always have the order correct. Great service. Generous toppings! my favorite is extra sauce, extra olives on the vegetarian but the BIG brother is amazing if you like meat! This is the best pizza if you enjoy thin crust. Salads are great too. I've ordered for office party catering and still amazing. GREAT JOB!!! GREAT PIZZA!

His customer service and kindness was above and beyond. We will definitely be using them again! Thank you for an awesome experience!!!

Review: This place is terrible, ignore the good reviews they are mostly old. Tried a new place with i Fratelli and "i" learned learned the hard way, their taste is less than bland. We ordered two pizzas, one looking like it had been caught up in F-5 twister both undercooked, the only real taste I could identify was flour. That was a waste of $42.03 and after one bit will be going into the trash. Waste of time, waste of money and hopefully won't be sick. It's raw!

Review: Pretty good thin crust pizza. Ordered the pepperoni and mushroom and ate outside at one of their patio tables with my dog. Appreciated the fast and courteous service. 

Unfortunately, the inside dining area does not exist and they don't have a soda machine. Instead, they serve cans. So it's a perfect place to grab a slice and go, or to order takeout/delivery. But it's not much of a restaurant.

I appreciated the opportunity to sit outside in the nice weather with my dog and eat some good pizza.

Review: Pizza is good, and I fratelli does it right. Ordered Delivery and it was about the normal time for it. However, the pizza and salad was worth the wait.

We got a pepperoni, marghareita, and meat pizza. All delicious, but the marghareita was my favorite one. The fresh tomatoes really brought flavor out the sauce, and the cheese was great. The pizza was a thin crust which I loved, and it was crispy. 

Finally the salad, omg. We used a little more dressing than normal, but it was perfect. I recommend the pizza here.

Review: Quick Note!!

Double check your pizza when you get it delivered. Our pizza was incorrect but I didn't catch it until we opened the box later to eat it.   It also looked like it may have sat for a while in the store before being delivered.

I contacted them but haven't heard back yet.

However upon getting home and taking the first bite of disappointment I was let down! The toppings seem fresh and delicious.

I love pizza so I'll do a second chance!

I have had the salad, and while it only really comes with lettuce, one or two olives, and a pickled pepper (like Papa John's) the italian dressing is YUMMY! I thought I wouldn't care for the salad when I saw that it was just lettuce, but it was so good I finished every bite.

Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! You won't regret it :)

Review: Great service and absolutely delicious. We ordered delivery, using a coupon on the website for a large 3-topping, breadsticks and two house salads ($18.95 or something thereabouts). 

Delivery came quickly, under 30 minutes. We went with hamburger, fresh basil and black olives. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the pie was piled with ground beef (reminded me of my Midwestern roots, where pizza parlors would season and fry a pound of meat and load it up) - no sparse toppings here. Every bite had crumbled beef, enough olives to taste but not overwhelm, and fragrant fresh basil. They really did not skimp on anything. The pizza was very balanced with a good ratio of crust, toppings, sauce. I personally love thin crust, so I was a happy camper. My husband tends toward thick/deep dish, but he agreed this was super good and wanted to know when we could order it again.

The house salad was essentially romaine (and maybe some iceberg) lettuce topped with fresh green onions. The house dressing was a delicious Italian, rich and balanced. It was pretty good, but I couldn't stop eating the pizza.

Incidentally, the delivery driver neglected our breadsticks. We tried to call her really quick after she left, just in case she was still in our apartment lot and could just turn around. She didn't answer, so we called the store to see if maybe they could get her before she got too far away. We weren't really stressing the breadsticks, if we didn't get them it wasn't a big deal, but we thought we'd try anyway. 

Crazy good customer service. When I called the store, I was referred to the manager who apologized profusely, said they would send the breadsticks right back out - and would comp the entire meal!! Holy smokes! We really were impressed. That's incredibly generous for just a missed order of breadsticks, and we will definitely order again. 

By the way, the breadsticks were thick, warm and covered in cheese. I was slowly nodding off from my food coma, but still ate one and a half of them dipped in marinara. Later I passed out. And mumbled things to myself about the sweet pizza.

Review: This is a consistently hot and delicious thin crust, hand made pizza, topped with an ample amount of your choice. A typical i Fratelli carry out or delivery, with no tables

Review: I placed a delivery order before the restaurant opened today and my order arrived earlier than expected, which was awesome. The food was so hot, fresh, and tasty. I will definitely order from this location again in the near future. Also, the delivery guy had great customer service. Thanks so much for the amazing experience.

Review: As a medical rep with a budget, this place is my go-to. The pizza is always a hit and it's not as frowned upon like bringing Pizza Hut or Dominos.  The staff though- they are so fantastic, always have my order ready and with a smile.  Thank you for the great service!
