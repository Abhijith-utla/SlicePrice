Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

4 stars
I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

4 stars
Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

Amazing food. So glad they are nearby. Sausage plate is 10/10 el perfecto. I enjoyed the bratwurst and nurmberger ones that i ordered.

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

5 stars
Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

5 stars
If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

5 stars
Great customer service amazing people I got the jeager schnitzel it was really good I hope I spelled it right I forgot to take a picture though

1 stars
In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

1 stars
I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

5 stars
We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

5 stars
I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

2 stars
The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

5 stars
Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

Food was excellent tonight.  Ham shank was amazing.  Server was funny and professional.  Lively atmosphere on a Saturday night.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

5 stars
A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

4 stars
I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

5 stars
This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Amazing food !!!  Will be back for sure!
Love the ambiance, reminds me of our trip to Europe.

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

4 stars
I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

5 stars
Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

5 stars
Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

4 stars
Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

Amazing food. So glad they are nearby. Sausage plate is 10/10 el perfecto. I enjoyed the bratwurst and nurmberger ones that i ordered.

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

5 stars
If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

5 stars
Great customer service amazing people I got the jeager schnitzel it was really good I hope I spelled it right I forgot to take a picture though

1 stars
In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

1 stars
I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

5 stars
We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

5 stars
I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

2 stars
The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

5 stars
Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

Food was excellent tonight.  Ham shank was amazing.  Server was funny and professional.  Lively atmosphere on a Saturday night.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

5 stars
A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

4 stars
I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

5 stars
This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

5 stars
Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

5 stars
Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

5 stars
Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

1 stars
I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Amazing food !!!  Will be back for sure!

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

4 stars
I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

5 stars
Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

4 stars
Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

Amazing food. So glad they are nearby. Sausage plate is 10/10 el perfecto. I enjoyed the bratwurst and nurmberger ones that i ordered.

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

5 stars
Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

5 stars
If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

5 stars
Great customer service amazing people I got the jeager schnitzel it was really good I hope I spelled it right I forgot to take a picture though

1 stars
In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

1 stars
I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

5 stars
We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

5 stars
I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

2 stars
The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

5 stars
A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

4 stars
I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

5 stars
This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

5 stars
Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

5 stars
Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

5 stars
Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

1 stars
I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

5 stars
Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

4 stars
Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

Amazing food. So glad they are nearby. Sausage plate is 10/10 el perfecto. I enjoyed the bratwurst and nurmberger ones that i ordered.

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

5 stars
If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

5 stars
Great customer service amazing people I got the jeager schnitzel it was really good I hope I spelled it right I forgot to take a picture though

1 stars
In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

1 stars
I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

5 stars
We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

5 stars
I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

2 stars
The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

5 stars
A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

4 stars
I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

3 stars
I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

5 stars
Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

5 stars
Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

5 stars
Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

1 stars
I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Amazing food !!!  Will be back for sure!
Love the ambiance, reminds me of our trip to Europe.

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

5 stars
Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

4 stars
Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

Amazing food. So glad they are nearby. Sausage plate is 10/10 el perfecto. I enjoyed the bratwurst and nurmberger ones that i ordered.

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

5 stars
Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

5 stars
If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

5 stars
Great customer service amazing people I got the jeager schnitzel it was really good I hope I spelled it right I forgot to take a picture though

1 stars
In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

1 stars
I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

5 stars
We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

5 stars
I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

2 stars
The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

5 stars
A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

4 stars
I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

5 stars
Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

5 stars
Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

5 stars
Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

1 stars
I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

5 stars
Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

4 stars
Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

5 stars
If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

5 stars
Great customer service amazing people I got the jeager schnitzel it was really good I hope I spelled it right I forgot to take a picture though

1 stars
In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

1 stars
I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

5 stars
We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

5 stars
I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

2 stars
The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

5 stars
This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

5 stars
Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

5 stars
Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

5 stars
Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

1 stars
I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

1 stars
I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

5 stars
Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

Food was excellent tonight.  Ham shank was amazing.  Server was funny and professional.  Lively atmosphere on a Saturday night.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

5 stars
This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

5 stars
Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

5 stars
Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

5 stars
Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

1 stars
I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

4 stars
Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

2 stars
The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

5 stars
Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

Food was excellent tonight.  Ham shank was amazing.  Server was funny and professional.  Lively atmosphere on a Saturday night.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

5 stars
A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

4 stars
I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

5 stars
This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

5 stars
Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

5 stars
Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

5 stars
Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

1 stars
I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

5 stars
Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

5 stars
This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

1 stars
I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

2 stars
The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

5 stars
Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

Food was excellent tonight.  Ham shank was amazing.  Server was funny and professional.  Lively atmosphere on a Saturday night.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

5 stars
A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

4 stars
I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

5 stars
This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

5 stars
Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

5 stars
Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!

5 stars
Wowza!

This place has been like 8 miles from me for 32 years and I did not even know they existed.  I was in the area and saw them and also saw their packed parking lot, and immediately looked on Yelp and saw their rating and said to myself "this is a must try kind of place"!  It absolutely IS a must try place, and you will not be disappointed...

The ambiance accurately captures a German restaurant and bier giertan.  The place transports you out of Plano and to Germany faster than any airline!

Our server Jordan did a great job.  He had a 16 top in addition to us and yet he handled it all beautifully.  

The food here is amazing!!!  It is 5-star all the way!  I got Marktfrau Pilz with Swiss Cheese, which were basically spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Amazing!  I also got what was Chicken Schnitzel, called Wiener Art.  Wowza was it good!

I will be back soon!!!  And next time I will safe room for dessert, because those looked amazing too!

1 stars
I was so excited to come here, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I am a German living in the US, and this was definitely NOT good Bavarian food. You could tell that it was pre-cooked and/or frozen food. The potato pancakes were hard and tasted old. So were the rolls. On top of that everything was grossly overpriced ($29 for regular dinner), and I have never seen a more pathetic looking Knödel in my life. Our waiter was very nice, but inexperienced and had no idea what the food even was. It is sad to know that Americans that never had real German food, will think that this is what it tastes like. Yuk!

The German beer selection is comprehensive and tasty. We love the German vibe. And it feels very much like a family. The service is friendly and helpful. 

The schnitzel ... OMG, so good!!! The sauce/gravy, I could eat it as a soup by itself it's that good.

We were lucky enough to be there when they had a holiday menu. The selection was incredible. Our friend enjoyed the fact that there was a variety plate so he could try several things at once.

4 stars
What a wonderful institution. I've been here at least a couple of times. It's a large, themed restaurant, lots of wooden chairs and seating areas. Think hard, think brown, think woven straw baskets, and lots of sausage variations and schnitzel. They probably also have beer and such, but that's outside my wheelhouse. They have two seating areas separated by the bar.

The main dining room to the left features the skytrain chugging itself across the room above your heads, hugging the perimeter and tunneling itself through the walls.

If you order the pâté that comes covered with lingonberry, then the owner himself, it appears, personally serves it to you, with an erect knife centered in the glass vessel. At the base are tiny bread loaves.

Other times, we ordered the Würste mit Kräuter Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut, which was basically a sausage sampler where you get to choose 5 off of their list. It comes with sauerkraut and potato salad. Each sausage is cooked differently (e.g. grilled vs boiled or steamed), and each has a varying levels of processed meat: some have hotdog consistency while others have chunky ground meat. Will it be salty? Of course.

The Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle und gemischtem Salat was less salty, and more or less enjoyable. It's a schnitzel topped with a mushroom sauce. I'd say this is more on the level of comfort food; don't expect any explosions of flavor. Comes with tiny dough piece dumplings and a side of veggies.

Their Gulsach Suppe was satisfying enough. Pleasant tasting.

Another nice thing about this place are their seasonal and holiday menu, which allow you to come back and experience different dishes.

In spring, they often feature very large white asparagus. Though, other than being white and large, I don't believe white asparagus offers anything additional in terms of flavor. They will also offer a selection of game meat--elk, wild boar. I opted for a some white asparagus wrapped in ham served over a salad. The asparagus tasted quite standard, and it came with a large knife. The salad itself was fine and dressed.

I'll probably come back here a few more times to try out more meat items on their menu. I would probably focus on elk, pork hock, duck, and some other schnitzel variations in the future.

3.5/5 Food
5/5 Service

Great vibes for someone who's looking to experience German food.  We went on a Thursday evening and we're quickly seated and greeted with free pretzels and mustard.

Our foods of choice included the...

* Classic sausage plate with mashed potatoes & sauerkraut
* Split pea soup (daily soup of the day)
* Fried brie and rolls (appetizer)
* Apfelstrudel (dessert)

The food was overall good! I think our personal preference is eating hearty good once in a while so it suited our cravings for the night.

The baked brie was soooo well melted inside and had a lovely crunchy exterior. It went well with the fruits and roll.

My partner enjoyed the sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut altogether (as in each bite had a bit of each).  They tasted better together than as individual items.

The split pea soup was very smokey in flavor, potentially due to the meat pieces. A bit salty but overall tasty.

Lastly, we ended with an apfelstrudel which was delicious. Not having it before, we anticipated a thicker and flakier pastry. It was closer to a crepe in texture instead, which was still good .

Great live music and vibes overall!

4 stars
Nice and clean environment.  Reminds me of a cracker barrel vibe.  The prices are higher but the dishes are very unique.  It took awhile to get our food as it's cooked to order but it was good.  Friendly service and some live music too.

I got chicken snitzel with mash potato and red cabbage. It was good. I didn't care much for the red cabbage tbh but the chicken snitzel itself was good and plenty. I love the decor and ambiance of this place, felt like you're in Europe

Every time I visit, I feel like I'm back in Bayern. The warm hospitality, the authentic flavors, and of course--the bier! Everything tastes so gut, it brings me right back. Gut geschmeckt! A must-visit for anyone craving a true Bavarian experience.

Went to a friend's birthday party here on Saturday. This is his favortie place to go. I had not been to the new location since they moved and was truly shocked at how big the new place was! We were seated near the live music and this is always a treat as you get to see children and adults do their Chicken Dance with hats the musician provides. Once we all placed our orders, our food came out more quickly than expected and as always, things were yummy. I had the elk dish and Dunkn beer that my friend David helped my pick out. Sabrina our server was fabulous, super attentive and never letting a water glass go empty. Kudos to the owners on keeping the decor and to the staff for making it an enjoyable evening for David and all his guests.

Food was great.  Large portions.  Saw they had a large selection of dunkel beer.  I asked the waiter to bring their best.   He did not disappoint.   Was one of the best beers I had in my life.  Thank you to that man!

I want to really like this place. 

It's fun and huge and such a unique experience. 
The food is good with lots of options that do not disappoint. 

But both times I went-the service SUCKED 
It took Forever to get our food. 
I came in a party of five for dinner and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours. We were so eager to leave. 

It took 30 minutes just for us to get our dessert!  And that was after we asked for it twice. 

So no thanks. This spot is not for me.

4 stars
We have been coming to the hotel next to this restaurant for several years and never eaten here until this trip!  The food was outstanding and the service was okay.  We really enjoyed the live music (accordion/bavarian music).  The service was slower than I would have expected and we had to wait often between water refills (we only drank water).  We don't have complaints per se, just noting the service was slower than we would have preferred.  We will go back.  Bread pudding is delicious - but we waited for 15+ minutes (it seemed - we didn't time it).  It was long enough we won't order that again.

5 stars
Enjoyed the food. Good atmosphere. Quick service when we went there recently for a late lunch. We ALWAYS enjoh the Bavarian Grill.

5 stars
Most authentic Bavarian cuisine in North Texas. 

The schnitzel is amazing and flavorful, the sides are excellent and add a great variety of flavor to the dish. The beer is always on tap and there's a large variety to choose from if you are into German Beers. 

The service is excellent, the hosts are always understanding and kind. The ambiance is very family oriented with live music and small trains going around on the walls. 

This establishment is outstanding and I hope to come here often!

3 stars
Granted, it's hard to have fresh vegetables in December- maybe swap out the tomatoes and cukes for something else in winter? Even the lettuce and parsley garnish were sad. Our waiter was very diligent albeit less experienced- he should stick with it. Beer choices were plentiful but pricey. Entrees: meat was tender, spatzele was tired- perhaps large batch and reheated? Desserts were plated with pride and did not disappoint. Lots of Bavarian memorabilia lends a feeling of being  there.

Stopped by for dinner. We enjoyed the sausage platter, fried brie, and potato pancakes. They have a huge selection of german beers. The servers are knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and friendly. They also had live music.

I informed server I have a gluten allergy. I was brought out their gluten free menu which states gluten free not gluten friendly. I ordered an appetizer and their gluten free bread. I got violently ill and was in the bathroom when the
main entrees came out. My son took a photo and showed me that they put his gluten entree in front of my seat and my gluten free to him. Informed him to switch it around so he would have his meal. When I came back to the table the owner asked me what was going on. I informed him of my severe allergy and asked if there was any way to make sure proper precautions were taken. He took offense to that and started gaslighting me saying food allergies take 3 hours to take effect and couldn't possibly be his food and that the menu doesn't say gluten free (at the top of the allergy menu it says it bold large lettering Gluten Free). I informed him that was not true and he said I had to pay for my entree even though I could not eat it and didn't even touch it. I was very sick and refused to argue with him any longer so my son and I left. As we were leaving the restaurant, two women (employees or managers) that we never saw once asked me what happened. I told them I got sick off the food, my food allergy wasn't taken seriously and had to pay for food I didn't eat nor couldn't eat. They then insisted I pay again. I told them I already paid (in money and physically) and would not be paying again. I did not appreciate them calling me a thief. They then got defensive and started gaslighting me saying that was no way to talk to them. I cursed them out in Polish and left. Most of the staff is Toxic. The only good one there was my server that kept apologizing to me.

We wanted to try this place since we've never been here before. This used to be Golden Corral. It's huge inside. The server said on weekends, it's packed. I ordered Salmon with German herb potato and vegetables. PB ordered assorted sausages mild to spicy served with potato salad and sauerkraut. I've personally never had German food before and to me, it was ok and I thought that portions were small and my dish was listed under pasta, but no pasta and I inquired about it and the server told me that although it's listed under pasta, it doesn't come with pasta which made no sense to me, but it was after the fact. We waited for a quite a while for the food. PB likes German food, bc he grew up in Ohio, but it's not my cup of tea just like I don't care for Cuban, Greek, Korean, Haitian or Ethiopian food. I must say that inside the restaurant, I felt like I was in Germany and nicely decorated. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job. I'm just glad I was able to experience this establishment.

Authentic German food is becoming a rarity  and Bavarian Grill does a nice job of fulfilling the German food cravings that my hungry belly often has. My go to is the Jägerschnitzel with red cabbage and their warmed herbed mustard potato salad. The menu will have their suggested side pairings but they are happy to substitute and add extras. Plenty of side options like spätzle, sauerkraut, creamy spinach and traditional German mixed salad. That may not even be half of the options and I love most of them. They have seasonal menus as well Spargel Fest and Schnitzel Fest menus. My most recent visit was for lunch and I have included photos of all the available menus. They have an incredibly expansive selection of great food. Of course the German options don't stop there. German beers for all tastes abound! Schnapps, wines, coffees and desserts are plentiful too. Finally the atmosphere is definitely European and extremely inviting as is the friendly service. If you are wanting to try authentic German food or already have and want to cure that craving this is a great option. Próst!

Delicious, authentic German food! Our entrees came with two sides of our choosing. Servers were great and attentive. The ambience was very nice and we enjoyed our lunch, also watching the trains go by on overhead!

If you had to ask me what my favorite restaurant in all of Plano was, it would be this one. I'm just a glutton for cheese, and this place has it in droves. From the amazing french onion soup to the fried brie dishes - this place is where it's at. It's pricey so I don't get to go nearly as often as I'd like but when I do I always feel right at home at the bar. Scared and not sure what beer to try? Just ask your server and they'll recommend things based on your preferences. Try the schnitzel too. OMG out of this world. I'll be back soon!

This place was great! If you want classic German food and beer, this place is for you. Hands down the best German beer selection on draft you'll find!

Some of the decor might be a little cheesy, but I liked it. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

The most amazing food!! I'm sad I didn't find this sooner in life but I'll be coming back often!!!

Overpriced food and drink.  Cafeteria quality food,  Manager does not care about the customer base.  Un-authentic food. Bland soggy veggies. Tasteless potatoes. Dry and tough Schnitzel.  What a disappointment!!

5 stars
Best German food in DFW, no contest. This is the closest I've had in the US to Bavarian food from Germany itself.

I usually get the Regensburger Bockbier Schnitzel, which comes with grilled vegetables and potatoes by default. You cannot go wrong with that dish unless you don't like fried food. 

Wash it all down with authentic German beers afterwards! And listen to live music if you get lucky.

....... CRITIC'S REVIEW ...... 
Fabulous!! GO! Very delicious and authentic German food. D Magazine winner. Authentic decor and plenty of seating in multiple areas. I used to go 15 years ago but moved farther away. Made the drive - and they are in a new location, much nicer, and the food quality it perfect now! (So good!!)

Here is what I had:

Rahm Schnitzel mit Kartoffelschnee und frischem Gemüse:
(Pan-seared Schnitzel, creamy sauce, mashed potatoes and summer vegetables.) 

Ok - I tweaked this and had them batter the pork and pan fry it... and it was exquisite!!! Totally delicious!!! I also got double sauce becyi love it that way. Can't wait to go back and get it again!!! 

Grilled Sausages "ala-carte":
It's not on the menu but you can order sausages on the side. They have a fabulous wild bore sausage with excellent traditional spices and a gentle maple profile. I also got the brautworst (perfect)! 

I can't explain how good this was - definitely go!!

Great customer service amazing people I got the jeager schnitzel it was really good I hope I spelled it right I forgot to take a picture though

In all honesty this was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. After 17 minutes after being seated and no server coming to our table, I had to ask the hostess if we had one. She was very nice, apologized, and even told our drink order.

After we ordered, our waitress finally came back 45 minutes later. We asked what the hold up was and she said it typically takes 45-60 minutes on weekends. After nothing for a while, I told her if it was not there in 10 minutes I wanted to just get the check for drinks and leave. She said okay and they finally delivered our meal 1 hour and 15 minutes after we ordered and ignored my request.

Sadly after all that time what I ordered was incorrect. I ordered wiener schnitzel and it came with some strange gravy on it. I told them to just take it back and I didn't want any anything else.

The manager brought something back a few minutes later and said he had it remade and he would not charge me. After dealing with all of that I take a couple of bites and learn the manager tried to get away with giving me fried pork, instead of veal. I find this pretty reprehensible for a restaurant to try to do that. Even is the service was good, I would never go back after that act of dishonesty. I told the waitress, but the manager never came back over.

We paid more than $120 for food that took 75 minutes to arrive after it took 20 minutes to get a waitress to our table. Most of it sat uneaten. No discount, no apology from a manager, nothing. 

As for the other food, the sauerkraut was very good, the sausages were pretty good, and everything else was inedible. We spent a week in Bavaria and Austria in September and none of their food even compared. The pork knuckle was not edible and the spatzle was dry and flavorless. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. I cannot put into words what an awful experience this was all around.

I would give it 0 star if I could. We waited for 49 mins pasted our reservation time. Sat down ,nobody even come and greet us for another 15 mins ,and still waiting.At this point,how good of the food is doesn't even matter,the service and management is absolutely horrible.
Updated,we finally called a waiter to our table to ask if anyone is going to serve us. He was very nice and took care of us ,still don't know who actually waits this table after sit here for 20 mins while other waitresses just passing our table and totally ignored us. 
Food is way over price for the quality,sausages really taste like store bought hot dogs .Over all ,it was the worst $300 spent for 5 people meal.

We always love having dinner at the Bavarian Grill. All food is fresh and delicious- love the Brie appetizer, the veal filled noodles is delicious (if I could remember the name I would tell you ) my husband gets the Weiner schnitzel with warm potato salad. We tried the chocolate torte for dessert. Yummy 
Service is always great and the owner stops by to makes sure your satisfied and everything is good. Love the German atmosphere and the train that runs around the room. Always an excellent experience.

I'll be honest, I forgot to take pictures of the food  however, Bavarian grill was soooo good and it impressed me in many ways.

The ambience of this place was amazing they had live music the whole time and it felt very inviting. People were buying drinks for the singer and it was just a great time. The waitress that helped us was super patient and communicative and helped us with the gluten free menu.

Speaking of, the gluten free menu is extensive and tasted really good. My girlfriend appreciates that. I will say, if you can still go for the non-gluten-free options. My friend's jeager snitzel was sooo good. As he put it "it was fire"  The bread they give out is really good and the beer we had was amazing. Everything was just top notch!

Some suggestions: First their menu is very shareable. Especially if your girlfriend doesn't eat a lot . I would also say their beer is worth trying. The glass is quite big and it was really good.

I don't have much experience with German food but I know something tastes good when it tastes good. I would recommend everyone try this place at least once!

The positive: the food is German. 
The negative: the service was incredibly slow. We waited hours for our food. We even had to get our own napkins and silverware. 
Our table was a mess and we bussed it ourselves. 
Not a good experience and we do not plan to return.

5 stars
Authentic German/Austrian food with a wine and beer selection that's close to impossible to beat and live music.  Figure $20 to $30 for what will be one of the bests meals of your life.

Food was excellent tonight.  Ham shank was amazing.  Server was funny and professional.  Lively atmosphere on a Saturday night.

I love this local German gem! I stopped here for lunch on a day off. I was alone, so sat in the bar area. The guy was attentive, and service was great. 

The food was delicious -- I had one of the stuffed schnitzel dishes with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. This dish takes a little longer to cook than some others, so the guy brought pretzels and (German!) mustard for me to munch on (I LOVE German mustard). 

The decor is very German here -- lots of cute stuff on display and on the walls. Definitely a do-over, until I can get back to Germany! Next time -- brats!

5 stars
A place like Bavarian Grill is not usually on my radar. Yet, we came for a family dinner on a casual Friday night, on the earlier side. We didn't wait for a table, and were seated quickly. 

The restaurant has grown over the years and is German-themed throughout, with live cultural music regularly. The music is accordion-style - and great for kids. They even take requests.!

While they don't really offer cocktails, they have a very extensive beer list as well as many wines.  Our server, who had just completed training the day prior, was really on point, knowledgeable, helpful, and pretty great through the entire experience. 

Now, onto the food:

Being someone who prefers food on the healthier side, I found a grilled salmon on the menu, which was cooked to perfection.  It's usually topped with a chive butter, which I asked to be put on the side. To keep it in line with my fitness goals, I stuck with the vegetables medley and boiled potatoes (instead of mashed). 

The escargot appetizer, served in actual snail shells, was delectable. And the free bread, both regular and pumpernickel was great, too. 

The table also got French Onion soups, potato pancakes, schnitzels; and sides of red cabbage. Everything was standard overall, they enjoyed their meals but I didn't have much of a taste. 

For dessert, we got a slice of the chocolate cream sponge cake torte, which was rich but decadent, along with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

We were celebrating a birthday, too, so the staff came out with cowbells to sing Happy Birthday! 

It was truly an experience, and would for sure go back next time my group is craving a schnitzel dinner (okay okay, I may still get the grilled salmon anyway lol).

I've been dining at Bavarian Grill since the early 90s (that's over 30 years if you're counting), but we had an experience last night that just didn't sit well with me. Let me first say that the food, as always, is very tasty, and it's not that we're going to stop dining here. 

About a week ago, I had made reservations for 16 for my wife's surprise birthday party at Bavarian Grill. One of the attendees had baked a homemade cake for the event, and brought it. Upon seeing the cake, not only was my friend informed that she could not serve it at the table, a bag was brought for her to put it in and she was asked to remove it from view. I've attended plenty of events like this where the host restaurant will gladly accept and will even freely provide plates and forks for these functions. Again, we had 16 people, so we brought some significant business to the establishment; I feel like being able to serve our cake wasn't too much to ask. 

So, moving forward, we'll continue to dine here as a couple and in small groups, but we'll never host a large event here, and we'll encourage others to find another restaurant to host such gatherings. Our party spent in excess of $700 on our appetizers and entrees (which, again, were delicious as always), but nary a dessert was ordered. This is poor form from a Plano institution and restaurant treasure.

I want to be clear: I have gone to Bavarian Grill x 20 years, typically quarterly. I love their recipes, my family has grown up doing the chicken dance with Alan, I've had toasts with Jurgen, and I know exactly what I'm in for. 

Since the move, things have gone off the rails, and it's not just growing pains. 

I think a majority of the issues revolve around staffing. They are perpetually understaffed. While standing at the bar (for 60 minutes waiting for my 7pm reservation) I counted 28 unwashed beer glasses sitting at the server station. Ticket after ticket sat there waiting for someone to fill the beer glass. 100% of the steins I saw go out were underfilled, likely a consequence of air in the lines plus a barely-18 year old bartender filling them with foam. The whole bar area stank like a frat house on Sunday morning. At $10-12/glass, and quite literally the major revenue generator, someone has to take care of the bar. 

The prices have always been on the edge of reasonable. I attributed that to overhead: keeping fresh German beer and food in stock isn't cheap. Plus you have to cover the cost of the musicians. I get it, it's dinner and a show. The new prices, however, have gone over that edge. When the entrees average $30, you're now in the premium dining realm. That means the experience and the quality have to match that price. Example: $10 for a pretzel is obscene. You wouldn't even find that pricing at an NFL game. The nickel & dime-ing for bread is especially irritating. The large charcuterie platter comes with 4 small rolls. When we ran out halfway through, waiter offered to bring 2 more rolls for $8. Sigh......

I want Bavarian Grill (and Jurgen) to succeed in the new place. If the issues above can be remedied, we will be back, as we have for many years.

Being a German family, the food wasn't very "German". The bread klöse were so small and burnt. The sauerbraten was dry. The spätzle weren't sautéed in butter after being boiled. I could go on and on but needless to say, we won't be coming back.

3 stars
Not a great experience, our server didn't seem to know how to do the job or she didn't care about it
The schnitzel was good and so was the beer. 
Desserts were a disappointment and the dirty high chair was really a turn-off.
We have found much better restaurants for the money, but we wanted to try a German restaurant since they're hard to find, they hide dessert and specialty koffee prices, so beware of high totals.

5 stars
This has got to be the best German restaurant I've ever been to. It was clean, with nice interior decor and good service. I really enjoyed my draft Paulaner Hefeweizen, my favorite German beer that I couldn't forget after my trip to Frankfurt, Germany, and I can confirm that the taste of the beer was exactly like what I had in Germany. The pork ham hock was a highlight, and to my surprise, it tasted very mild, not saltish at all, and very crispy. It was a very enjoyable dish.  I also enjoyed the cold cuts sampler with the pretzel, the meats were very tasty. The bratwurst stuff mushrooms was very flavorful and I liked it a lot.

4 stars
The place is festive and lively . It's very busy so it's better to make reservations. The staff are dress in Bavarian theme and an older gentleman is playing accordion in the background. We arrived 15 minute earlier but we got seated right away. I suggest looking at the menu beforehand just cuz it can get confusing if it is your first time . The food got serve a bit longer though. We spend about 2 hours in that place , so it's not your go to if you want to eat in a hurry . The servers are friendly and we enjoyed our time there just relaxing and taking our time and enjoying the festive and lively atmosphere .
I ordered  Oberstdorfer Sauerbraten mit Semmelknödel und Rotkraut, the marinated beef was very tender and tasted tangy and somewhat sweet, it was definitely something different for a change . It came with a bread dumpling ( not my kind of taste) , but I like the taste of red cabbage, definitely Bavarian taste.. But if you like sure thing then I suggest you got for schnitzel, my son had a Schnitzel "Maximilian, he loved it  , breaded pork topped with ham
And sunny side up eggs, he said the ham tasted like bacon!
Hubby got Bamberger Bier Zipfel auf Kraut und
Kräuter Kartoffelstampf. A pork and beef sausage which is think is okay. 
For Dessert we had the  Bayerish Kreme , raspberry creamy  sort of gelatin and cheesecake like texture , not overly sweet with a bit of appropriate sour taste with cake at the bottom.
I would say all in all we had an enjoyable experience and I won't mind going back and try something else in the menu.

It pains me to write this review. I grew up in Germany my dad was stationed there in the army.

Tonight I went to Bavarian grill with a couple of friends to enjoy the ambience and enjoy German food. I used to go to Bavarian grill all of the time for a lunch snitzel. Now they've moved here to a shitty Golden Corral restaurant. 

That's fine and all. But here's the deal. We ordered 2 snitzels and 1 chicken Caesar salad. A few liters of beer. And because they want to charge 12.fucking.50  per white asparagus sprig, we're now walking out with a 200 tab. 

Number 1) pork snitzel consists of a 2 dollar piece of meat, pounded and flattened, covered in egg wash and panko crumbs which I'll be generous, maybe a 6 dollar ordeal. 2) a chicken Caesar salad is 0 dollars plus (let's be generous again) 3 dollars for the chicken. 3) a liter of beer that tastes like refreshing horse piss they charge 9 dollars per 16 oz. 

There is something wrong here. Where are the bells? (Bells you say? What bells?) oh, we'll fucking get to that.

So the two folks I'm with get their main dishes with hollandaise coating their uncrusted snitzels with two big ole sprigs of white asparagus on top. Still looked delicious and the eating proved that. Delicious meal. But is that a 48 dollar plate? 2 shittily pounded pork filets covered with hollandaise and two pieces of white asparagus? The answer is no. You can do this at home. 

My salad or 'salat' if we're being "fancy" and pretending to speak German. Trash. Absolute trash. I asked my friend to taste a piece of the chicken because I was like "did they just run a butane torch over this chicken? " my friend said no 'that's smoked chicken'. Bullshit. It tastes like someone "smoked" my chicken by spraying it with butane and bug spray. The croutons were old and gross, and the salad dressing tasted like it was on the edge of expiration. 

Meanwhile, every time we got into a meaningful conversation someone was having a birthday weeeeee. Let's get out more bullshit and bang around poorly played cowbells in the tune of happy birthday. This happened 7 times. Even the accordion player was like wtf?  

I won't be back. Because 56 bucks for a shitty chicken Caesar 'salat' and 164 dollars for unbreaded, hollandaise coated(oh they weren't thin either), trash pork with two 12.50 sprigs of white asparagus is just too expensive. This place is going to close soon with this kind of nonsense.

Arrived a little before 5:30pm on a Saturday night. They were starting to get busy but we were seated right away. Ordered the lindauer geschnetzeltes from the spring menu which reminded me of beef stroganoff & the bockbier pretzel crusted schnitzel. Both were ok tasting, the schnitzel was a bit tough. 

Food took way too long to come out, about 45 minutes with no explanation. They brought the wrong food out twice as well. Maybe it was an off night.

4 stars
Love this restaurant! The fall seasonal menu was stunning so we returned for the spring one. 

The duck legs were very tender and flavorful and the sides complimented it well. 

The tilapia was quite a bit under salted. I ended up needing mustard to make it flavored enough for me. But the texture was very nice. I loved the soft fish with crispy exterior. Also get the oven baked potatoes. They're absolutely devine!!

Food was good and came out fast and accurate!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu items!

Best real German food and beer in the U.S.  Period.

I can't believe I've never done a Yelp review for Bavarian Grill, yet. I figure it's because when I started going many many years ago, it was before smart phones and doing reviews as you dine. But still... I should have. This place is great for many reasons, and not just the food and beer!

FOOD
World. Class. And lots of creative options. Plus, special menus throughout the year with even more variety. I've eaten so many items and can't even pick favorites but the Ham Hock, half Duck, any of the schnitzels, and late fall they have a wild game sausage and other fun wild game items (Elk Schnitzel!) that are spectacular

BEER
Again, world class. And for good reason - Juergen cares about his beer program. It has to be German beer - no budweiser - and draft is served in the correct, authentic glassware - what a collection of glassware!  There's even a beer card you can begin filling out to earn your very own STEIN!

GLASSWARE
OK, I just mentioned the glassware but then I realized it should be it's own topic.  There are hundreds of beer glasses from German breweries behind the counter including some very special glasses that are reported to be the only 7 of them in the entire US - very limited, and very large :)

STAFF
The staff is fantastic with several members being part of the family for many years.  They want to answer questions and tell what they know.  Riley is the beer manager is incredibly knowledgeable.  Allen is not on staff but regularly plays his accordian while wearing his authentic German garb.

ATTIRE
Lots of great outfits abound

EVENTS
Special events are worth watching out for - sign up for the email list!  They do special dinners (roasting an entire pig?  Yup!) and multiple beer events (tastings with breweries, etc).  

OTHER
It is pricey to offer authentic ingredients so know that you'll pay more than other restaurants but I believe strongly you get what you pay for.  So, it's not cheap but worth every penny - you'll leave full and happy!
