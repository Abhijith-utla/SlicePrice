From the moment my daughter and I walked into this place, we were greeted by the incredible Nadir, and let me tell you, he transformed our visit into something truly special.

The food? Absolutely delicious. But the experience? Even better, because of him. Nadir's passion for what he does radiates through every interaction. His genuine hospitality, enthusiasm, and dedication made us feel valued in a way that goes far beyond customer service, it felt like a personal connection.

Exceptional service can make or break a dining experience, and Nadir is the reason I'd return without hesitation. This is more than just a place to eat, it's a place where the people make a difference. If you're looking for top-tier food and a top-tier experience, I highly recommend this spot.

great food and service. the mixed shawarma was lovely. thanks to the owner who provided dates for us.

5 stars
Great authentic style shawarma. 

Simple yet delicious, and the Cole slaw that comes on the side with fries and picked vegetables are a great compliment. 

My only complaint - I have never received the extra sauce that I pay for when I order for pick up. 

Ambiance is basically a stepped up hole in the wall spot. Casual but great shawarma.

4 stars
I'm so glad this opened up!  I love mediterranean food.  Met up here with a friend on a weekday to catch up and this spot was perfect.  I like to try to eat healthy and the food is really flavorful here.  

I got the falafel wrap and my friend got the tabouleh salad.  Really friendly service and it was pretty quiet.  We were able to take our time and mind you we were there for quite a long lunch!  The wraps are pretty big so I probably could have taken 1/2 of it home for a second meal.

5 stars
Wow, omg the chicken Shwarma!! Chef's kiss!! The meat was so tender and flavorful. The wrap on the outside tasted like heaven as well. At first I thought about asking for extra sauce but I stopped myself. It would have overpowered the tasty chicken. For veggies there were some Lettuce and tomatoes, which adds a nice balance. 

Falafels were also some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy outside and soft inside. The nutty flavor were really shining through. 

For drinks I tried the Saffron tea which is something new and very comforting on a cold winter night. I would definitely be back! 
Wonderful Arabic music playing through through meal was a nice touch and the service was topped notch.

4 stars
I had an interesting experience at this spot. First off, I somehow ended up in the bathroom in the dark--couldn't figure out the lights. Could have very well been a skill issue on my part, but it added a little unintentional adventure to the visit.

Our waitress seemed a bit frazzled, but she was sweet and did her best to accommodate us. We ordered hibiscus tea, but after putting the order, they apparently ran out. They subbed it with something else, with the condition that if we didn't like it, they'd take it off the check. That was a nice gesture, especially considering we were a larger party during lunchtime.

When we arrived, it was pretty empty, with only 3-4 other tables occupied. The food itself was good and flavorful. I had the lamb kabob plate and a gyro, and both were packed with flavor and absolutely delicious. However, I'd suggest being cautious with the pickled items--they were quite sour for my taste. The yogurt drink was also quite sour but felt really healthy when I was drinking it

Overall, the atmosphere was pleasant, and despite a few hiccups, I left satisfied. Worth a visit!

5 stars
This unassuming spot is tucked away in a strip mall next to Tom Thumb. The space small and the tables are open, so not ideal for intimate conversation. But the friendly staff and decor make the ambiance cozy. We were a little intimidated by the authentic menu but our server was kind and patient to explain everything to us. We enjoyed the chicken shawarma Arabic style with pickled vegetables and slaw and the gyro sandwich. The falafel was fresh and flavorful. On our first visit, we were treated to complimentary cashew baklava - which is only had with pistachios. Just a bit of honey made it a slightly sweet ending to our meal. We've gone back twice now and will definitely be including it in our regular rotation of locally-owned restaurants.

Excellent, flavorful, big portions and super filling.

Reminds me of the street carts in New York City, and that's a good thing (I guess?)

Having been to a few Mediterranean places in the area we decided to give this place a try since we were close to it. When we first walked in we noticed how homely the interior looked. It had the feeling of a mom and pop establishment and we felt like we were going to get some good food. I had high hopes especially given the number of good reviews I read about on Yelp. 

However after we ordered our food we quickly became disenchanted with the quality of the restaurant. Since we had a family size group we decided to order the family meal since we have great success with family meals at Mediterranean places in the past. I wasn't too hungry and thought I'd just eat pita and baba ganoush so that is what I ordered. My husband wanted something extra so he ordered the lamb kabob. First came the baba ganoush(not pictured) it was drowned in oil and the pita served with it was cold, not a good start. Next came the chicken shawarma platter, the best part of the platter was the fries, the wraps taste like frozen food that was reheated and they looked nothing like picture on the menu. The exterior of the wraps were almost grey in color and didn't have the typical light and crispy texture that they normally have at any decent Mediterranean place, and they were soggy and dripping in oil. Last came the puny kabob tucked into a piece of pita bread(not pictured), which was an odd and unappetizing way to plate food. In addition, kabob was chewy and lacked decent flavor. My kids were hungry so they ate the greasy food all the while raving about the place we went to in Richardson the week prior. 

To make matters worse the service was sloppy. The poor guy who was very friendly and kind, had to work the register, run the food from the kitchen and wait the tables. He often forgot the things we requested and needed such as utensils. Also be prepared to purchase water since the water isn't filtered and has an off taste. I must say we will not return to this place ever.

5 stars
My husband ordered Pita Shawarma for take out, and the food was delicious! 

I had the beef shawarma rice plate. It came with a side of hummus and a fresh cut salad. The portions were generous.

He noted how friendly the man at the counter was!

Welcome to flavor time.  The chicken kabobs are phenomenal, high quality a me tons of flavor.  The garlic sauce is fantastic also great value.

5 stars
The Gyro was full of flavor and deliciousness. The fried chicken was ok. My wife said the coleslaw was not the best but who cares - we're here for the Mediterranean food. 

Anyway, I see why this place have 5 stars. Will definitely be back!

5 stars
The food was delicious. The portions were large and very reasonably priced. We had the hummus appetizer which came with plenty of warm, fresh pita. The hummus was very flavorful, as well.  We also had the beef shawarma and chicken shawarma sandwiches. Both were delicious. We were able to take half home for another meal! We definitely recommend Pita Shawarma any time you're in the mood for a casual Mediterranean meal!

NEW FAV FOOD PLACE
I'm excited to put this place in my rotation of local food! The portions were huge and DELICIOUS!! 
The place is pretty new-new so there is no soda machine and the water is bottled but honestly I'm coming for the food and it does not disappoint. We got baklava as well as entrees and took it home for later!
The guys serving were super nice and knowledgeable too! 
I think their sandwiches will do really well when the school year starts again and students from the senior high are looking for off-campus lunch! 

10/10 recommend!

5 stars
Great service and food! Seasoning is perfect. We tried the mixed plate to try a bit of everything and couldn't decide on a favorite because it was all so good.

The only place that reminded me of shawarma from Jordan in all of Texas. The chicken is so flavorful and the owner is so welcoming.

Hello everyone.

Since I come from the Caucasus, we have a sufficiently developed shawarma. Hoping to try delicious shawarma in the USA, I was surprised how not tasty it was.

Why serve sweet cabbage with shawarma?

Why does the beef sauce give bitterness?

Shawarma with beef 4/10

Shawarma with chicken 8/10

5 stars
Great food! You need to try it out. Open late and friendly service. Location is very convenient for central Plano.

5 stars
Chicken shawarma was really good, we can taste the freshness of the bread, perfectly toasted to add a bit of crisp. Chicken was moist and well marinated and the sauce in the wrap was amazing .

5 stars
Excellent hospitality. Excellent service. Excellent food.

We had the Chicken and the Beef Shawarma plates. Very fresh, very delicious. 

We'll be back, and we'll tell all our friends too.

Thanks!

5 stars
Ordered the mixed plate. Thought it was kind of expensive on Uber eats ($23) but it was a monster plate of food with pitas. Salad was delicious with generous amount of cheese. Pita was flavorful and so was the hummus. The meats were cooked and spiced perfectly. The rice was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. Amazing, new favorite spot.

5 stars
First: the ambiance. So I messed up and only orders fries via Uber eats pick up.  So the guy at the counter was nice enough to take my order and explain my mistake .

Despite my mess-up, the food came out in a timely manner! I also got the peach barbican and it was so good!

When I came home and finally tasted the food, I can conclude that this is one of the best fries I've had in my life. It was crisp and perfectly seasoned. The falafel tasted very fresh! However, I will request to have the sauce on the side next time since it was too wet by the time I got to eat if.

I will definitely be back!

5 stars
Incredible food and even better service. This is now our new favorite spot. Highly recommend.

I ordered lamb kabob.  Quality of meat and flavor was so good.
Overall, I prefer real silver wears for eat in, not plastic ones.

3 stars
"This will be the best shawarma you've ever had!" I enjoyed the enthusiasm from presumably the owner after he took our order and we sat down.

While it wasn't bad, it certainly didn't come close to Sara's in Richardson. The chicken was a bit dry honestly and no amount of sauce could cover that up. It did make it quite greasy though and unpleasant to sit with.

I wouldn't order the beef plate again. The meat was also quite dry. I also wasn't a fan of the salas or neon veggie mix. They season the meat and rice extremely well though. Unfortunately that meant most of my bites had whole pieces of coriander, clove, and mace that were quite potent and could probably chip a tooth. 

I'm sure this spot will become quite popular with student and people in the area. The ownership is also very proud and the service is great. Overall though, there are better spots around town. I would come back here if I was in the area though.

5 stars
I had a great experience. The staff were nice, the food was great, and the food arrived in a relatively  fast speed. I enjoyed my food and trying shawarmas for the first time here was a definite 10/10. Thank you for the amazing food!

4 stars
Ample parking, plenty of seating, and very nice man running the place. The food was very good and I would have been happy just eating the salad and pickled veggies. Lots of cucumbers and tomatoes with romaine tossed in a light vinaigrette with feta cheese. 
The gyro plate was good but very different than any other gyro I've had. This meat was not shaved off like typical but seemed to be formed into thin long strips and then grilled? The rice was beautifully seasoned and delicious. 
I also ordered the falafels (unfortunately could t just purchase one or two so had to get the entire order of six). They were fresh and crispy with a great garlic sauce to dip in. I also enjoyed them with the tzatziki sauce. 
My only complaint was the pita bread. It was very dry and a bit hard. Definitely not up to par with the rest of the food. 
Overall good visit and I would come back.

Simply amazing!  The flavor, the service both tops!  Happy we tried Pita Shawarma! 

We didn't want a lot of food, so experience is limited.  Gyro wrap and Beef Shawarma were both fire!  The hummus we got was incredible as well! 

I look forward to trying more on my return visit - and I'm already counting the days!

I got the beef shawarma & it was very yummy. juicy and flavorful! Nadeer greeted us with warm smiles; will be returning!

The food was packed with flavor and the portions were huge. We took home our leftovers and they were just as tasty the next day.  The shawarma was a bit dry, but our absolute favorite was the beef kabob.  We can't wait to add this place into our local restaurant rotation! Love supporting neighborhood spots!

Good was bland. Location is small. Felt like a fish in a fishbowl when I walked in. The service not good. 

I had to wait at the counter to place an order. Waited for over 15min before someone came out. Mind you, this is after I tried using Uber eats to place an order but got a message stating this location isn't accepting orders. Also tried calling prior to my arrival but the ph# on Google was incorrect and the Yelp ph# only kept ringing with no answer. 

Finally someone comes out. I place an order, wait 20min. Get my order. I get home and it's the wrong order. I stated exactly what was listed on the menu. They said I placed the wrong order. Not wanting to argue, I asked if I could place another order in exchange. They stated no. I asked for a refund, they also said no. 

I'm giving them 2 stars only because I don't like bashing small businesses but my experience was inexcusable.
Good luck to anyone who goes here

Slow. It takes way too long to get your food ( an hr and 15 minutes) when you go here. We ended up asking for our order to be cancelled and it worked out because it wasn't even made yet. I gave it a 2nd shot because of the great reviews but sadly that was a miss also.. i did it through grub hub this time and went to pickup my salad 45 minutes later to then be told they didn't have the ingredients.. we tried but this is a pass

5 stars
This is my first time at this restaurant.   But I will definitely be back.  The kebobs were flavorful, the rice yummy, and the hummus creamy.   The service was also delightful .

My two friends and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at Pita Shawarma.  The food was excellent, attractively presented, and very tasty.  The restaurant is small, but attractively done and had a pleasant atmosphere.  Our wait staff was a friendly and attentive Jordanian college student who spoke excellent English.  The BIG question:  would I go back to Pita Shawarma again?  Absolutely!  I wish this restaurant were located in Mansfield so I could go more often because I love Mediterranean cuisine.

Absolutely fresh delicious and packed with flavor. The best hummus, tabouli and in house made pita bread. The lamb was marinated and cooked to perfection. Everything is made in house, fresh and exploding with flavor. There were no leftover. The Ashta custard was so good. My mouth is watering thinking of all this delicious food. I wish they were here in Texas.

We ordered the falafel order , chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. One of the best falafel we've tried in dfw. Everything on the plate was so good in particular the garlic sauce in the chicken plate it was so light. Enjoyed our meal so much, very good service as well :) !!

Falafels were also some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy outside and soft inside. The nutty flavor were really shining through.

I'm giving them 2 stars only because I don't like bashing small businesses but my experience was inexcusable.
Good luck to anyone who goes here

Nadir was awesome! And the food was even better. My wife and I both got a shawarma wrap! It was very flavorful and good portion. Will be back!

Slow. It takes way too long to get your food ( an hr and 15 minutes) when you go here. We ended up asking for our order to be cancelled and it worked out because it wasn't even made yet. I gave it a 2nd shot because of the great reviews but sadly that was a miss also.. i did it through grub hub this time and went to pickup my salad 45 minutes later to then be told they didn't have the ingredients.. we tried but this is a pass

This is my first time at this restaurant.   But I will definitely be back.  The kebobs were flavorful, the rice yummy, and the hummus creamy.   The service was also delightful .

My two friends and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at Pita Shawarma.  The food was excellent, attractively presented, and very tasty.  The restaurant is small, but attractively done and had a pleasant atmosphere.  Our wait staff was a friendly and attentive Jordanian college student who spoke excellent English.  The BIG question:  would I go back to Pita Shawarma again?  Absolutely!  I wish this restaurant were located in Mansfield so I could go more often because I love Mediterranean cuisine.

First time at pita shawarma and it was super yummy. The shawarma was so tasty and the fries were seasoned nicely. Staff is super friendly and inviting.

The food is really good. Great quality ingredients and great service. Clean restaurant with good portions.

Absolutely fresh delicious and packed with flavor. The best hummus, tabouli and in house made pita bread. The lamb was marinated and cooked to perfection. Everything is made in house, fresh and exploding with flavor. There were no leftover. The Ashta custard was so good. My mouth is watering thinking of all this delicious food. I wish they were here in Texas.

We ordered the falafel order , chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. One of the best falafel we've tried in dfw. Everything on the plate was so good in particular the garlic sauce in the chicken plate it was so light. Enjoyed our meal so much, very good service as well :) !!

5 stars
From the moment my daughter and I walked into this place, we were greeted by the incredible Nadir, and let me tell you, he transformed our visit into something truly special.

The food? Absolutely delicious. But the experience? Even better, because of him. Nadir's passion for what he does radiates through every interaction. His genuine hospitality, enthusiasm, and dedication made us feel valued in a way that goes far beyond customer service, it felt like a personal connection.

Exceptional service can make or break a dining experience, and Nadir is the reason I'd return without hesitation. This is more than just a place to eat, it's a place where the people make a difference. If you're looking for top-tier food and a top-tier experience, I highly recommend this spot.

5 stars
great food and service. the mixed shawarma was lovely. thanks to the owner who provided dates for us.

5 stars
Great authentic style shawarma. 

Simple yet delicious, and the Cole slaw that comes on the side with fries and picked vegetables are a great compliment. 

My only complaint - I have never received the extra sauce that I pay for when I order for pick up. 

Ambiance is basically a stepped up hole in the wall spot. Casual but great shawarma.

4 stars
I'm so glad this opened up!  I love mediterranean food.  Met up here with a friend on a weekday to catch up and this spot was perfect.  I like to try to eat healthy and the food is really flavorful here.  

I got the falafel wrap and my friend got the tabouleh salad.  Really friendly service and it was pretty quiet.  We were able to take our time and mind you we were there for quite a long lunch!  The wraps are pretty big so I probably could have taken 1/2 of it home for a second meal.

5 stars
Wow, omg the chicken Shwarma!! Chef's kiss!! The meat was so tender and flavorful. The wrap on the outside tasted like heaven as well. At first I thought about asking for extra sauce but I stopped myself. It would have overpowered the tasty chicken. For veggies there were some Lettuce and tomatoes, which adds a nice balance. 

Falafels were also some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy outside and soft inside. The nutty flavor were really shining through. 

For drinks I tried the Saffron tea which is something new and very comforting on a cold winter night. I would definitely be back! 
Wonderful Arabic music playing through through meal was a nice touch and the service was topped notch.

4 stars
I had an interesting experience at this spot. First off, I somehow ended up in the bathroom in the dark--couldn't figure out the lights. Could have very well been a skill issue on my part, but it added a little unintentional adventure to the visit.

Our waitress seemed a bit frazzled, but she was sweet and did her best to accommodate us. We ordered hibiscus tea, but after putting the order, they apparently ran out. They subbed it with something else, with the condition that if we didn't like it, they'd take it off the check. That was a nice gesture, especially considering we were a larger party during lunchtime.

When we arrived, it was pretty empty, with only 3-4 other tables occupied. The food itself was good and flavorful. I had the lamb kabob plate and a gyro, and both were packed with flavor and absolutely delicious. However, I'd suggest being cautious with the pickled items--they were quite sour for my taste. The yogurt drink was also quite sour but felt really healthy when I was drinking it

Overall, the atmosphere was pleasant, and despite a few hiccups, I left satisfied. Worth a visit!

5 stars
This unassuming spot is tucked away in a strip mall next to Tom Thumb. The space small and the tables are open, so not ideal for intimate conversation. But the friendly staff and decor make the ambiance cozy. We were a little intimidated by the authentic menu but our server was kind and patient to explain everything to us. We enjoyed the chicken shawarma Arabic style with pickled vegetables and slaw and the gyro sandwich. The falafel was fresh and flavorful. On our first visit, we were treated to complimentary cashew baklava - which is only had with pistachios. Just a bit of honey made it a slightly sweet ending to our meal. We've gone back twice now and will definitely be including it in our regular rotation of locally-owned restaurants.

Having been to a few Mediterranean places in the area we decided to give this place a try since we were close to it. When we first walked in we noticed how homely the interior looked. It had the feeling of a mom and pop establishment and we felt like we were going to get some good food. I had high hopes especially given the number of good reviews I read about on Yelp. 

However after we ordered our food we quickly became disenchanted with the quality of the restaurant. Since we had a family size group we decided to order the family meal since we have great success with family meals at Mediterranean places in the past. I wasn't too hungry and thought I'd just eat pita and baba ganoush so that is what I ordered. My husband wanted something extra so he ordered the lamb kabob. First came the baba ganoush(not pictured) it was drowned in oil and the pita served with it was cold, not a good start. Next came the chicken shawarma platter, the best part of the platter was the fries, the wraps taste like frozen food that was reheated and they looked nothing like picture on the menu. The exterior of the wraps were almost grey in color and didn't have the typical light and crispy texture that they normally have at any decent Mediterranean place, and they were soggy and dripping in oil. Last came the puny kabob tucked into a piece of pita bread(not pictured), which was an odd and unappetizing way to plate food. In addition, kabob was chewy and lacked decent flavor. My kids were hungry so they ate the greasy food all the while raving about the place we went to in Richardson the week prior. 

To make matters worse the service was sloppy. The poor guy who was very friendly and kind, had to work the register, run the food from the kitchen and wait the tables. He often forgot the things we requested and needed such as utensils. Also be prepared to purchase water since the water isn't filtered and has an off taste. I must say we will not return to this place ever.

5 stars
My husband ordered Pita Shawarma for take out, and the food was delicious! 

I had the beef shawarma rice plate. It came with a side of hummus and a fresh cut salad. The portions were generous.

He noted how friendly the man at the counter was!

The Gyro was full of flavor and deliciousness. The fried chicken was ok. My wife said the coleslaw was not the best but who cares - we're here for the Mediterranean food. 

Anyway, I see why this place have 5 stars. Will definitely be back!

The food was delicious. The portions were large and very reasonably priced. We had the hummus appetizer which came with plenty of warm, fresh pita. The hummus was very flavorful, as well.  We also had the beef shawarma and chicken shawarma sandwiches. Both were delicious. We were able to take half home for another meal! We definitely recommend Pita Shawarma any time you're in the mood for a casual Mediterranean meal!

NEW FAV FOOD PLACE
I'm excited to put this place in my rotation of local food! The portions were huge and DELICIOUS!! 
The place is pretty new-new so there is no soda machine and the water is bottled but honestly I'm coming for the food and it does not disappoint. We got baklava as well as entrees and took it home for later!
The guys serving were super nice and knowledgeable too! 
I think their sandwiches will do really well when the school year starts again and students from the senior high are looking for off-campus lunch! 

10/10 recommend!

Great service and food! Seasoning is perfect. We tried the mixed plate to try a bit of everything and couldn't decide on a favorite because it was all so good.

Hello everyone.

Since I come from the Caucasus, we have a sufficiently developed shawarma. Hoping to try delicious shawarma in the USA, I was surprised how not tasty it was.

Why serve sweet cabbage with shawarma?

Why does the beef sauce give bitterness?

Shawarma with beef 4/10

Shawarma with chicken 8/10

5 stars
Great food! You need to try it out. Open late and friendly service. Location is very convenient for central Plano.

Chicken shawarma was really good, we can taste the freshness of the bread, perfectly toasted to add a bit of crisp. Chicken was moist and well marinated and the sauce in the wrap was amazing .

5 stars
Excellent hospitality. Excellent service. Excellent food.

We had the Chicken and the Beef Shawarma plates. Very fresh, very delicious. 

We'll be back, and we'll tell all our friends too.

Thanks!

Ordered the mixed plate. Thought it was kind of expensive on Uber eats ($23) but it was a monster plate of food with pitas. Salad was delicious with generous amount of cheese. Pita was flavorful and so was the hummus. The meats were cooked and spiced perfectly. The rice was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. Amazing, new favorite spot.

5 stars
First: the ambiance. So I messed up and only orders fries via Uber eats pick up.  So the guy at the counter was nice enough to take my order and explain my mistake .

Despite my mess-up, the food came out in a timely manner! I also got the peach barbican and it was so good!

When I came home and finally tasted the food, I can conclude that this is one of the best fries I've had in my life. It was crisp and perfectly seasoned. The falafel tasted very fresh! However, I will request to have the sauce on the side next time since it was too wet by the time I got to eat if.

I will definitely be back!

5 stars
Incredible food and even better service. This is now our new favorite spot. Highly recommend.

I ordered lamb kabob.  Quality of meat and flavor was so good.
Overall, I prefer real silver wears for eat in, not plastic ones.

"This will be the best shawarma you've ever had!" I enjoyed the enthusiasm from presumably the owner after he took our order and we sat down.

While it wasn't bad, it certainly didn't come close to Sara's in Richardson. The chicken was a bit dry honestly and no amount of sauce could cover that up. It did make it quite greasy though and unpleasant to sit with.

I wouldn't order the beef plate again. The meat was also quite dry. I also wasn't a fan of the salas or neon veggie mix. They season the meat and rice extremely well though. Unfortunately that meant most of my bites had whole pieces of coriander, clove, and mace that were quite potent and could probably chip a tooth. 

I'm sure this spot will become quite popular with student and people in the area. The ownership is also very proud and the service is great. Overall though, there are better spots around town. I would come back here if I was in the area though.

5 stars
I had a great experience. The staff were nice, the food was great, and the food arrived in a relatively  fast speed. I enjoyed my food and trying shawarmas for the first time here was a definite 10/10. Thank you for the amazing food!

4 stars
Ample parking, plenty of seating, and very nice man running the place. The food was very good and I would have been happy just eating the salad and pickled veggies. Lots of cucumbers and tomatoes with romaine tossed in a light vinaigrette with feta cheese. 
The gyro plate was good but very different than any other gyro I've had. This meat was not shaved off like typical but seemed to be formed into thin long strips and then grilled? The rice was beautifully seasoned and delicious. 
I also ordered the falafels (unfortunately could t just purchase one or two so had to get the entire order of six). They were fresh and crispy with a great garlic sauce to dip in. I also enjoyed them with the tzatziki sauce. 
My only complaint was the pita bread. It was very dry and a bit hard. Definitely not up to par with the rest of the food. 
Overall good visit and I would come back.

Today was our first time dining at Pita Shawarma for lunch. We ordered the chicken shawarma, gyro wrap & mix shawarma plate.  The gyro was the highlight. The meat was tender & flavorful. The mix shawarma plate included a salad & hummus.  Everything was good & the cashier was very friendly!

5 stars
Simply amazing!  The flavor, the service both tops!  Happy we tried Pita Shawarma! 

We didn't want a lot of food, so experience is limited.  Gyro wrap and Beef Shawarma were both fire!  The hummus we got was incredible as well! 

I look forward to trying more on my return visit - and I'm already counting the days!

I got the beef shawarma & it was very yummy. juicy and flavorful! Nadeer greeted us with warm smiles; will be returning!

The food was packed with flavor and the portions were huge. We took home our leftovers and they were just as tasty the next day.  The shawarma was a bit dry, but our absolute favorite was the beef kabob.  We can't wait to add this place into our local restaurant rotation! Love supporting neighborhood spots!

Really great food and chill atmosphere! The Gyro Combo was delicious. Would recommend!

2 stars
Good was bland. Location is small. Felt like a fish in a fishbowl when I walked in. The service not good. 

I had to wait at the counter to place an order. Waited for over 15min before someone came out. Mind you, this is after I tried using Uber eats to place an order but got a message stating this location isn't accepting orders. Also tried calling prior to my arrival but the ph# on Google was incorrect and the Yelp ph# only kept ringing with no answer. 

Finally someone comes out. I place an order, wait 20min. Get my order. I get home and it's the wrong order. I stated exactly what was listed on the menu. They said I placed the wrong order. Not wanting to argue, I asked if I could place another order in exchange. They stated no. I asked for a refund, they also said no. 

I'm giving them 2 stars only because I don't like bashing small businesses but my experience was inexcusable.
Good luck to anyone who goes here

Ample parking, plenty of seating, and very nice man running the place. The food was very good and I would have been happy just eating the salad and pickled veggies. Lots of cucumbers and tomatoes with romaine tossed in a light vinaigrette with feta cheese. 
The gyro plate was good but very different than any other gyro I've had. This meat was not shaved off like typical but seemed to be formed into thin long strips and then grilled? The rice was beautifully seasoned and delicious. 
I also ordered the falafels (unfortunately could t just purchase one or two so had to get the entire order of six). They were fresh and crispy with a great garlic sauce to dip in. I also enjoyed them with the tzatziki sauce. 
My only complaint was the pita bread. It was very dry and a bit hard. Definitely not up to par with the rest of the food. 
Overall good visit and I would come back.

Today was our first time dining at Pita Shawarma for lunch. We ordered the chicken shawarma, gyro wrap & mix shawarma plate.  The gyro was the highlight. The meat was tender & flavorful. The mix shawarma plate included a salad & hummus.  Everything was good & the cashier was very friendly!

5 stars
Simply amazing!  The flavor, the service both tops!  Happy we tried Pita Shawarma! 

We didn't want a lot of food, so experience is limited.  Gyro wrap and Beef Shawarma were both fire!  The hummus we got was incredible as well! 

I look forward to trying more on my return visit - and I'm already counting the days!

I got the beef shawarma & it was very yummy. juicy and flavorful! Nadeer greeted us with warm smiles; will be returning!

The food was packed with flavor and the portions were huge. We took home our leftovers and they were just as tasty the next day.  The shawarma was a bit dry, but our absolute favorite was the beef kabob.  We can't wait to add this place into our local restaurant rotation! Love supporting neighborhood spots!

Really great food and chill atmosphere! The Gyro Combo was delicious. Would recommend!

2 stars
Good was bland. Location is small. Felt like a fish in a fishbowl when I walked in. The service not good. 

I had to wait at the counter to place an order. Waited for over 15min before someone came out. Mind you, this is after I tried using Uber eats to place an order but got a message stating this location isn't accepting orders. Also tried calling prior to my arrival but the ph# on Google was incorrect and the Yelp ph# only kept ringing with no answer. 

Finally someone comes out. I place an order, wait 20min. Get my order. I get home and it's the wrong order. I stated exactly what was listed on the menu. They said I placed the wrong order. Not wanting to argue, I asked if I could place another order in exchange. They stated no. I asked for a refund, they also said no. 

I'm giving them 2 stars only because I don't like bashing small businesses but my experience was inexcusable.
Good luck to anyone who goes here

Slow. It takes way too long to get your food ( an hr and 15 minutes) when you go here. We ended up asking for our order to be cancelled and it worked out because it wasn't even made yet. I gave it a 2nd shot because of the great reviews but sadly that was a miss also.. i did it through grub hub this time and went to pickup my salad 45 minutes later to then be told they didn't have the ingredients.. we tried but this is a pass

This is my first time at this restaurant.   But I will definitely be back.  The kebobs were flavorful, the rice yummy, and the hummus creamy.   The service was also delightful .

My two friends and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at Pita Shawarma.  The food was excellent, attractively presented, and very tasty.  The restaurant is small, but attractively done and had a pleasant atmosphere.  Our wait staff was a friendly and attentive Jordanian college student who spoke excellent English.  The BIG question:  would I go back to Pita Shawarma again?  Absolutely!  I wish this restaurant were located in Mansfield so I could go more often because I love Mediterranean cuisine.

Absolutely fresh delicious and packed with flavor. The best hummus, tabouli and in house made pita bread. The lamb was marinated and cooked to perfection. Everything is made in house, fresh and exploding with flavor. There were no leftover. The Ashta custard was so good. My mouth is watering thinking of all this delicious food. I wish they were here in Texas.

5 stars
We ordered the falafel order , chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. One of the best falafel we've tried in dfw. Everything on the plate was so good in particular the garlic sauce in the chicken plate it was so light. Enjoyed our meal so much, very good service as well :) !!

5 stars
From the moment my daughter and I walked into this place, we were greeted by the incredible Nadir, and let me tell you, he transformed our visit into something truly special.

The food? Absolutely delicious. But the experience? Even better, because of him. Nadir's passion for what he does radiates through every interaction. His genuine hospitality, enthusiasm, and dedication made us feel valued in a way that goes far beyond customer service, it felt like a personal connection.

Exceptional service can make or break a dining experience, and Nadir is the reason I'd return without hesitation. This is more than just a place to eat, it's a place where the people make a difference. If you're looking for top-tier food and a top-tier experience, I highly recommend this spot.

5 stars
great food and service. the mixed shawarma was lovely. thanks to the owner who provided dates for us.

5 stars
Great authentic style shawarma. 

Simple yet delicious, and the Cole slaw that comes on the side with fries and picked vegetables are a great compliment. 

My only complaint - I have never received the extra sauce that I pay for when I order for pick up. 

Ambiance is basically a stepped up hole in the wall spot. Casual but great shawarma.

4 stars
I'm so glad this opened up!  I love mediterranean food.  Met up here with a friend on a weekday to catch up and this spot was perfect.  I like to try to eat healthy and the food is really flavorful here.  

I got the falafel wrap and my friend got the tabouleh salad.  Really friendly service and it was pretty quiet.  We were able to take our time and mind you we were there for quite a long lunch!  The wraps are pretty big so I probably could have taken 1/2 of it home for a second meal.

5 stars
Wow, omg the chicken Shwarma!! Chef's kiss!! The meat was so tender and flavorful. The wrap on the outside tasted like heaven as well. At first I thought about asking for extra sauce but I stopped myself. It would have overpowered the tasty chicken. For veggies there were some Lettuce and tomatoes, which adds a nice balance. 

Falafels were also some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy outside and soft inside. The nutty flavor were really shining through. 

For drinks I tried the Saffron tea which is something new and very comforting on a cold winter night. I would definitely be back! 
Wonderful Arabic music playing through through meal was a nice touch and the service was topped notch.

4 stars
I had an interesting experience at this spot. First off, I somehow ended up in the bathroom in the dark--couldn't figure out the lights. Could have very well been a skill issue on my part, but it added a little unintentional adventure to the visit.

Our waitress seemed a bit frazzled, but she was sweet and did her best to accommodate us. We ordered hibiscus tea, but after putting the order, they apparently ran out. They subbed it with something else, with the condition that if we didn't like it, they'd take it off the check. That was a nice gesture, especially considering we were a larger party during lunchtime.

When we arrived, it was pretty empty, with only 3-4 other tables occupied. The food itself was good and flavorful. I had the lamb kabob plate and a gyro, and both were packed with flavor and absolutely delicious. However, I'd suggest being cautious with the pickled items--they were quite sour for my taste. The yogurt drink was also quite sour but felt really healthy when I was drinking it

Overall, the atmosphere was pleasant, and despite a few hiccups, I left satisfied. Worth a visit!

5 stars
This unassuming spot is tucked away in a strip mall next to Tom Thumb. The space small and the tables are open, so not ideal for intimate conversation. But the friendly staff and decor make the ambiance cozy. We were a little intimidated by the authentic menu but our server was kind and patient to explain everything to us. We enjoyed the chicken shawarma Arabic style with pickled vegetables and slaw and the gyro sandwich. The falafel was fresh and flavorful. On our first visit, we were treated to complimentary cashew baklava - which is only had with pistachios. Just a bit of honey made it a slightly sweet ending to our meal. We've gone back twice now and will definitely be including it in our regular rotation of locally-owned restaurants.

Having been to a few Mediterranean places in the area we decided to give this place a try since we were close to it. When we first walked in we noticed how homely the interior looked. It had the feeling of a mom and pop establishment and we felt like we were going to get some good food. I had high hopes especially given the number of good reviews I read about on Yelp. 

However after we ordered our food we quickly became disenchanted with the quality of the restaurant. Since we had a family size group we decided to order the family meal since we have great success with family meals at Mediterranean places in the past. I wasn't too hungry and thought I'd just eat pita and baba ganoush so that is what I ordered. My husband wanted something extra so he ordered the lamb kabob. First came the baba ganoush(not pictured) it was drowned in oil and the pita served with it was cold, not a good start. Next came the chicken shawarma platter, the best part of the platter was the fries, the wraps taste like frozen food that was reheated and they looked nothing like picture on the menu. The exterior of the wraps were almost grey in color and didn't have the typical light and crispy texture that they normally have at any decent Mediterranean place, and they were soggy and dripping in oil. Last came the puny kabob tucked into a piece of pita bread(not pictured), which was an odd and unappetizing way to plate food. In addition, kabob was chewy and lacked decent flavor. My kids were hungry so they ate the greasy food all the while raving about the place we went to in Richardson the week prior. 

To make matters worse the service was sloppy. The poor guy who was very friendly and kind, had to work the register, run the food from the kitchen and wait the tables. He often forgot the things we requested and needed such as utensils. Also be prepared to purchase water since the water isn't filtered and has an off taste. I must say we will not return to this place ever.

5 stars
My husband ordered Pita Shawarma for take out, and the food was delicious! 

I had the beef shawarma rice plate. It came with a side of hummus and a fresh cut salad. The portions were generous.

He noted how friendly the man at the counter was!

The Gyro was full of flavor and deliciousness. The fried chicken was ok. My wife said the coleslaw was not the best but who cares - we're here for the Mediterranean food. 

Anyway, I see why this place have 5 stars. Will definitely be back!

The food was delicious. The portions were large and very reasonably priced. We had the hummus appetizer which came with plenty of warm, fresh pita. The hummus was very flavorful, as well.  We also had the beef shawarma and chicken shawarma sandwiches. Both were delicious. We were able to take half home for another meal! We definitely recommend Pita Shawarma any time you're in the mood for a casual Mediterranean meal!

NEW FAV FOOD PLACE
I'm excited to put this place in my rotation of local food! The portions were huge and DELICIOUS!! 
The place is pretty new-new so there is no soda machine and the water is bottled but honestly I'm coming for the food and it does not disappoint. We got baklava as well as entrees and took it home for later!
The guys serving were super nice and knowledgeable too! 
I think their sandwiches will do really well when the school year starts again and students from the senior high are looking for off-campus lunch! 

10/10 recommend!

Hello everyone.

Since I come from the Caucasus, we have a sufficiently developed shawarma. Hoping to try delicious shawarma in the USA, I was surprised how not tasty it was.

Why serve sweet cabbage with shawarma?

Why does the beef sauce give bitterness?

Shawarma with beef 4/10

Shawarma with chicken 8/10

5 stars
Great food! You need to try it out. Open late and friendly service. Location is very convenient for central Plano.

5 stars
Chicken shawarma was really good, we can taste the freshness of the bread, perfectly toasted to add a bit of crisp. Chicken was moist and well marinated and the sauce in the wrap was amazing .

5 stars
Excellent hospitality. Excellent service. Excellent food.

We had the Chicken and the Beef Shawarma plates. Very fresh, very delicious. 

We'll be back, and we'll tell all our friends too.

Thanks!

5 stars
Ordered the mixed plate. Thought it was kind of expensive on Uber eats ($23) but it was a monster plate of food with pitas. Salad was delicious with generous amount of cheese. Pita was flavorful and so was the hummus. The meats were cooked and spiced perfectly. The rice was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. Amazing, new favorite spot.

5 stars
First: the ambiance. So I messed up and only orders fries via Uber eats pick up.  So the guy at the counter was nice enough to take my order and explain my mistake .

Despite my mess-up, the food came out in a timely manner! I also got the peach barbican and it was so good!

When I came home and finally tasted the food, I can conclude that this is one of the best fries I've had in my life. It was crisp and perfectly seasoned. The falafel tasted very fresh! However, I will request to have the sauce on the side next time since it was too wet by the time I got to eat if.

I will definitely be back!

5 stars
Incredible food and even better service. This is now our new favorite spot. Highly recommend.

I ordered lamb kabob.  Quality of meat and flavor was so good.
Overall, I prefer real silver wears for eat in, not plastic ones.

"This will be the best shawarma you've ever had!" I enjoyed the enthusiasm from presumably the owner after he took our order and we sat down.

While it wasn't bad, it certainly didn't come close to Sara's in Richardson. The chicken was a bit dry honestly and no amount of sauce could cover that up. It did make it quite greasy though and unpleasant to sit with.

I wouldn't order the beef plate again. The meat was also quite dry. I also wasn't a fan of the salas or neon veggie mix. They season the meat and rice extremely well though. Unfortunately that meant most of my bites had whole pieces of coriander, clove, and mace that were quite potent and could probably chip a tooth. 

I'm sure this spot will become quite popular with student and people in the area. The ownership is also very proud and the service is great. Overall though, there are better spots around town. I would come back here if I was in the area though.

Ample parking, plenty of seating, and very nice man running the place. The food was very good and I would have been happy just eating the salad and pickled veggies. Lots of cucumbers and tomatoes with romaine tossed in a light vinaigrette with feta cheese. 
The gyro plate was good but very different than any other gyro I've had. This meat was not shaved off like typical but seemed to be formed into thin long strips and then grilled? The rice was beautifully seasoned and delicious. 
I also ordered the falafels (unfortunately could t just purchase one or two so had to get the entire order of six). They were fresh and crispy with a great garlic sauce to dip in. I also enjoyed them with the tzatziki sauce. 
My only complaint was the pita bread. It was very dry and a bit hard. Definitely not up to par with the rest of the food. 
Overall good visit and I would come back.

Great food! You need to try it out. Open late and friendly service. Location is very convenient for central Plano.

5 stars
Chicken shawarma was really good, we can taste the freshness of the bread, perfectly toasted to add a bit of crisp. Chicken was moist and well marinated and the sauce in the wrap was amazing .

5 stars
Excellent hospitality. Excellent service. Excellent food.

We had the Chicken and the Beef Shawarma plates. Very fresh, very delicious. 

We'll be back, and we'll tell all our friends too.

Thanks!

Ordered the mixed plate. Thought it was kind of expensive on Uber eats ($23) but it was a monster plate of food with pitas. Salad was delicious with generous amount of cheese. Pita was flavorful and so was the hummus. The meats were cooked and spiced perfectly. The rice was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. Amazing, new favorite spot.

5 stars
First: the ambiance. So I messed up and only orders fries via Uber eats pick up.  So the guy at the counter was nice enough to take my order and explain my mistake .

Despite my mess-up, the food came out in a timely manner! I also got the peach barbican and it was so good!

When I came home and finally tasted the food, I can conclude that this is one of the best fries I've had in my life. It was crisp and perfectly seasoned. The falafel tasted very fresh! However, I will request to have the sauce on the side next time since it was too wet by the time I got to eat if.

I will definitely be back!

5 stars
Incredible food and even better service. This is now our new favorite spot. Highly recommend.

I ordered lamb kabob.  Quality of meat and flavor was so good.
Overall, I prefer real silver wears for eat in, not plastic ones.

"This will be the best shawarma you've ever had!" I enjoyed the enthusiasm from presumably the owner after he took our order and we sat down.

While it wasn't bad, it certainly didn't come close to Sara's in Richardson. The chicken was a bit dry honestly and no amount of sauce could cover that up. It did make it quite greasy though and unpleasant to sit with.

I wouldn't order the beef plate again. The meat was also quite dry. I also wasn't a fan of the salas or neon veggie mix. They season the meat and rice extremely well though. Unfortunately that meant most of my bites had whole pieces of coriander, clove, and mace that were quite potent and could probably chip a tooth. 

I'm sure this spot will become quite popular with student and people in the area. The ownership is also very proud and the service is great. Overall though, there are better spots around town. I would come back here if I was in the area though.

5 stars
I had a great experience. The staff were nice, the food was great, and the food arrived in a relatively  fast speed. I enjoyed my food and trying shawarmas for the first time here was a definite 10/10. Thank you for the amazing food!

4 stars
Ample parking, plenty of seating, and very nice man running the place. The food was very good and I would have been happy just eating the salad and pickled veggies. Lots of cucumbers and tomatoes with romaine tossed in a light vinaigrette with feta cheese. 
The gyro plate was good but very different than any other gyro I've had. This meat was not shaved off like typical but seemed to be formed into thin long strips and then grilled? The rice was beautifully seasoned and delicious. 
I also ordered the falafels (unfortunately could t just purchase one or two so had to get the entire order of six). They were fresh and crispy with a great garlic sauce to dip in. I also enjoyed them with the tzatziki sauce. 
My only complaint was the pita bread. It was very dry and a bit hard. Definitely not up to par with the rest of the food. 
Overall good visit and I would come back.

Today was our first time dining at Pita Shawarma for lunch. We ordered the chicken shawarma, gyro wrap & mix shawarma plate.  The gyro was the highlight. The meat was tender & flavorful. The mix shawarma plate included a salad & hummus.  Everything was good & the cashier was very friendly!

5 stars
Simply amazing!  The flavor, the service both tops!  Happy we tried Pita Shawarma! 

We didn't want a lot of food, so experience is limited.  Gyro wrap and Beef Shawarma were both fire!  The hummus we got was incredible as well! 

I look forward to trying more on my return visit - and I'm already counting the days!

5 stars
I got the beef shawarma & it was very yummy. juicy and flavorful! Nadeer greeted us with warm smiles; will be returning!

4 stars
The food was packed with flavor and the portions were huge. We took home our leftovers and they were just as tasty the next day.  The shawarma was a bit dry, but our absolute favorite was the beef kabob.  We can't wait to add this place into our local restaurant rotation! Love supporting neighborhood spots!

5 stars
great service. very healthy food . Nadir was very good. I will be bringing my wife. The food portions are huge too

5 stars
Really great food and chill atmosphere! The Gyro Combo was delicious. Would recommend!

2 stars
Good was bland. Location is small. Felt like a fish in a fishbowl when I walked in. The service not good. 

I had to wait at the counter to place an order. Waited for over 15min before someone came out. Mind you, this is after I tried using Uber eats to place an order but got a message stating this location isn't accepting orders. Also tried calling prior to my arrival but the ph# on Google was incorrect and the Yelp ph# only kept ringing with no answer. 

Finally someone comes out. I place an order, wait 20min. Get my order. I get home and it's the wrong order. I stated exactly what was listed on the menu. They said I placed the wrong order. Not wanting to argue, I asked if I could place another order in exchange. They stated no. I asked for a refund, they also said no. 

I'm giving them 2 stars only because I don't like bashing small businesses but my experience was inexcusable.
Good luck to anyone who goes here

Slow. It takes way too long to get your food ( an hr and 15 minutes) when you go here. We ended up asking for our order to be cancelled and it worked out because it wasn't even made yet. I gave it a 2nd shot because of the great reviews but sadly that was a miss also.. i did it through grub hub this time and went to pickup my salad 45 minutes later to then be told they didn't have the ingredients.. we tried but this is a pass

5 stars
This is my first time at this restaurant.   But I will definitely be back.  The kebobs were flavorful, the rice yummy, and the hummus creamy.   The service was also delightful .

My two friends and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at Pita Shawarma.  The food was excellent, attractively presented, and very tasty.  The restaurant is small, but attractively done and had a pleasant atmosphere.  Our wait staff was a friendly and attentive Jordanian college student who spoke excellent English.  The BIG question:  would I go back to Pita Shawarma again?  Absolutely!  I wish this restaurant were located in Mansfield so I could go more often because I love Mediterranean cuisine.

5 stars
First time at pita shawarma and it was super yummy. The shawarma was so tasty and the fries were seasoned nicely. Staff is super friendly and inviting.

5 stars
The food is great and the service. I definitely recommend this restaurant. We had the chicken shawerma sandwich and chicken kabob platter.

5 stars
The food is really good. Great quality ingredients and great service. Clean restaurant with good portions.

5 stars
Absolutely fresh delicious and packed with flavor. The best hummus, tabouli and in house made pita bread. The lamb was marinated and cooked to perfection. Everything is made in house, fresh and exploding with flavor. There were no leftover. The Ashta custard was so good. My mouth is watering thinking of all this delicious food. I wish they were here in Texas.

5 stars
We ordered the falafel order , chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. One of the best falafel we've tried in dfw. Everything on the plate was so good in particular the garlic sauce in the chicken plate it was so light. Enjoyed our meal so much, very good service as well :) !!

5 stars
From the moment my daughter and I walked into this place, we were greeted by the incredible Nadir, and let me tell you, he transformed our visit into something truly special.

The food? Absolutely delicious. But the experience? Even better, because of him. Nadir's passion for what he does radiates through every interaction. His genuine hospitality, enthusiasm, and dedication made us feel valued in a way that goes far beyond customer service, it felt like a personal connection.

Exceptional service can make or break a dining experience, and Nadir is the reason I'd return without hesitation. This is more than just a place to eat, it's a place where the people make a difference. If you're looking for top-tier food and a top-tier experience, I highly recommend this spot.

5 stars
great food and service. the mixed shawarma was lovely. thanks to the owner who provided dates for us.

5 stars
Great authentic style shawarma. 

Simple yet delicious, and the Cole slaw that comes on the side with fries and picked vegetables are a great compliment. 

My only complaint - I have never received the extra sauce that I pay for when I order for pick up. 

Ambiance is basically a stepped up hole in the wall spot. Casual but great shawarma.

4 stars
I'm so glad this opened up!  I love mediterranean food.  Met up here with a friend on a weekday to catch up and this spot was perfect.  I like to try to eat healthy and the food is really flavorful here.  

I got the falafel wrap and my friend got the tabouleh salad.  Really friendly service and it was pretty quiet.  We were able to take our time and mind you we were there for quite a long lunch!  The wraps are pretty big so I probably could have taken 1/2 of it home for a second meal.

5 stars
Wow, omg the chicken Shwarma!! Chef's kiss!! The meat was so tender and flavorful. The wrap on the outside tasted like heaven as well. At first I thought about asking for extra sauce but I stopped myself. It would have overpowered the tasty chicken. For veggies there were some Lettuce and tomatoes, which adds a nice balance. 

Falafels were also some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy outside and soft inside. The nutty flavor were really shining through. 

For drinks I tried the Saffron tea which is something new and very comforting on a cold winter night. I would definitely be back! 
Wonderful Arabic music playing through through meal was a nice touch and the service was topped notch.

4 stars
I had an interesting experience at this spot. First off, I somehow ended up in the bathroom in the dark--couldn't figure out the lights. Could have very well been a skill issue on my part, but it added a little unintentional adventure to the visit.

Our waitress seemed a bit frazzled, but she was sweet and did her best to accommodate us. We ordered hibiscus tea, but after putting the order, they apparently ran out. They subbed it with something else, with the condition that if we didn't like it, they'd take it off the check. That was a nice gesture, especially considering we were a larger party during lunchtime.

When we arrived, it was pretty empty, with only 3-4 other tables occupied. The food itself was good and flavorful. I had the lamb kabob plate and a gyro, and both were packed with flavor and absolutely delicious. However, I'd suggest being cautious with the pickled items--they were quite sour for my taste. The yogurt drink was also quite sour but felt really healthy when I was drinking it

Overall, the atmosphere was pleasant, and despite a few hiccups, I left satisfied. Worth a visit!

We enjoyed the chicken shawarma Arabic style with pickled vegetables and slaw and the gyro sandwich. The falafel was fresh and flavorful.

We've gone back twice now and will definitely be including it in our regular rotation of locally-owned restaurants.

Having been to a few Mediterranean places in the area we decided to give this place a try since we were close to it. When we first walked in we noticed how homely the interior looked. It had the feeling of a mom and pop establishment and we felt like we were going to get some good food. I had high hopes especially given the number of good reviews I read about on Yelp. 

However after we ordered our food we quickly became disenchanted with the quality of the restaurant. Since we had a family size group we decided to order the family meal since we have great success with family meals at Mediterranean places in the past. I wasn't too hungry and thought I'd just eat pita and baba ganoush so that is what I ordered. My husband wanted something extra so he ordered the lamb kabob. First came the baba ganoush(not pictured) it was drowned in oil and the pita served with it was cold, not a good start. Next came the chicken shawarma platter, the best part of the platter was the fries, the wraps taste like frozen food that was reheated and they looked nothing like picture on the menu. The exterior of the wraps were almost grey in color and didn't have the typical light and crispy texture that they normally have at any decent Mediterranean place, and they were soggy and dripping in oil. Last came the puny kabob tucked into a piece of pita bread(not pictured), which was an odd and unappetizing way to plate food. In addition, kabob was chewy and lacked decent flavor. My kids were hungry so they ate the greasy food all the while raving about the place we went to in Richardson the week prior. 

To make matters worse the service was sloppy. The poor guy who was very friendly and kind, had to work the register, run the food from the kitchen and wait the tables. He often forgot the things we requested and needed such as utensils. Also be prepared to purchase water since the water isn't filtered and has an off taste. I must say we will not return to this place ever.

5 stars
My husband ordered Pita Shawarma for take out, and the food was delicious! 

I had the beef shawarma rice plate. It came with a side of hummus and a fresh cut salad. The portions were generous.

He noted how friendly the man at the counter was!

Excellent chicken shawarma, indoor seating & really kind server. The outa and hummus was delish too!! Highly recommend giving this small establishment a try.

Welcome to flavor time.  The chicken kabobs are phenomenal, high quality a me tons of flavor.  The garlic sauce is fantastic also great value.

5 stars
The Gyro was full of flavor and deliciousness. The fried chicken was ok. My wife said the coleslaw was not the best but who cares - we're here for the Mediterranean food. 

Anyway, I see why this place have 5 stars. Will definitely be back!

5 stars
The food was delicious. The portions were large and very reasonably priced. We had the hummus appetizer which came with plenty of warm, fresh pita. The hummus was very flavorful, as well.  We also had the beef shawarma and chicken shawarma sandwiches. Both were delicious. We were able to take half home for another meal! We definitely recommend Pita Shawarma any time you're in the mood for a casual Mediterranean meal!

5 stars
NEW FAV FOOD PLACE
I'm excited to put this place in my rotation of local food! The portions were huge and DELICIOUS!! 
The place is pretty new-new so there is no soda machine and the water is bottled but honestly I'm coming for the food and it does not disappoint. We got baklava as well as entrees and took it home for later!
The guys serving were super nice and knowledgeable too! 
I think their sandwiches will do really well when the school year starts again and students from the senior high are looking for off-campus lunch! 

10/10 recommend!

5 stars
Great service and food! Seasoning is perfect. We tried the mixed plate to try a bit of everything and couldn't decide on a favorite because it was all so good.

The only place that reminded me of shawarma from Jordan in all of Texas. The chicken is so flavorful and the owner is so welcoming.

The food is FANTASTIC! A must visit for this area! If you're traveling through Plano and you're looking for some awesome Mediterranean food then this is your place.

Hello everyone.

Since I come from the Caucasus, we have a sufficiently developed shawarma. Hoping to try delicious shawarma in the USA, I was surprised how not tasty it was.

Why serve sweet cabbage with shawarma?

Why does the beef sauce give bitterness?

Shawarma with beef 4/10

Shawarma with chicken 8/10

I had the beef shawarma rice plate. It came with a side of hummus and a fresh cut salad. The portions were generous.

He noted how friendly the man at the counter was!

Welcome to flavor time.  The chicken kabobs are phenomenal, high quality a me tons of flavor.  The garlic sauce is fantastic also great value.

5 stars
The Gyro was full of flavor and deliciousness. The fried chicken was ok. My wife said the coleslaw was not the best but who cares - we're here for the Mediterranean food. 

Anyway, I see why this place have 5 stars. Will definitely be back!

5 stars
The food was delicious. The portions were large and very reasonably priced. We had the hummus appetizer which came with plenty of warm, fresh pita. The hummus was very flavorful, as well.  We also had the beef shawarma and chicken shawarma sandwiches. Both were delicious. We were able to take half home for another meal! We definitely recommend Pita Shawarma any time you're in the mood for a casual Mediterranean meal!

NEW FAV FOOD PLACE
I'm excited to put this place in my rotation of local food! The portions were huge and DELICIOUS!! 
The place is pretty new-new so there is no soda machine and the water is bottled but honestly I'm coming for the food and it does not disappoint. We got baklava as well as entrees and took it home for later!
The guys serving were super nice and knowledgeable too! 
I think their sandwiches will do really well when the school year starts again and students from the senior high are looking for off-campus lunch! 

10/10 recommend!

5 stars
Great service and food! Seasoning is perfect. We tried the mixed plate to try a bit of everything and couldn't decide on a favorite because it was all so good.

The only place that reminded me of shawarma from Jordan in all of Texas. The chicken is so flavorful and the owner is so welcoming.

The food is FANTASTIC! A must visit for this area! If you're traveling through Plano and you're looking for some awesome Mediterranean food then this is your place.

Hello everyone.

Since I come from the Caucasus, we have a sufficiently developed shawarma. Hoping to try delicious shawarma in the USA, I was surprised how not tasty it was.

Why serve sweet cabbage with shawarma?

Why does the beef sauce give bitterness?

Shawarma with beef 4/10

Shawarma with chicken 8/10

5 stars
Great food! You need to try it out. Open late and friendly service. Location is very convenient for central Plano.

5 stars
Chicken shawarma was really good, we can taste the freshness of the bread, perfectly toasted to add a bit of crisp. Chicken was moist and well marinated and the sauce in the wrap was amazing .

5 stars
Excellent hospitality. Excellent service. Excellent food.

We had the Chicken and the Beef Shawarma plates. Very fresh, very delicious. 

We'll be back, and we'll tell all our friends too.

Thanks!

5 stars
Ordered the mixed plate. Thought it was kind of expensive on Uber eats ($23) but it was a monster plate of food with pitas. Salad was delicious with generous amount of cheese. Pita was flavorful and so was the hummus. The meats were cooked and spiced perfectly. The rice was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. Amazing, new favorite spot.

5 stars
First: the ambiance. So I messed up and only orders fries via Uber eats pick up.  So the guy at the counter was nice enough to take my order and explain my mistake .

Despite my mess-up, the food came out in a timely manner! I also got the peach barbican and it was so good!

When I came home and finally tasted the food, I can conclude that this is one of the best fries I've had in my life. It was crisp and perfectly seasoned. The falafel tasted very fresh! However, I will request to have the sauce on the side next time since it was too wet by the time I got to eat if.

I will definitely be back!

5 stars
Incredible food and even better service. This is now our new favorite spot. Highly recommend.

4 stars
I ordered lamb kabob.  Quality of meat and flavor was so good.
Overall, I prefer real silver wears for eat in, not plastic ones.

3 stars
"This will be the best shawarma you've ever had!" I enjoyed the enthusiasm from presumably the owner after he took our order and we sat down.

While it wasn't bad, it certainly didn't come close to Sara's in Richardson. The chicken was a bit dry honestly and no amount of sauce could cover that up. It did make it quite greasy though and unpleasant to sit with.

I wouldn't order the beef plate again. The meat was also quite dry. I also wasn't a fan of the salas or neon veggie mix. They season the meat and rice extremely well though. Unfortunately that meant most of my bites had whole pieces of coriander, clove, and mace that were quite potent and could probably chip a tooth. 

I'm sure this spot will become quite popular with student and people in the area. The ownership is also very proud and the service is great. Overall though, there are better spots around town. I would come back here if I was in the area though.

5 stars
I had a great experience. The staff were nice, the food was great, and the food arrived in a relatively  fast speed. I enjoyed my food and trying shawarmas for the first time here was a definite 10/10. Thank you for the amazing food!

4 stars
Ample parking, plenty of seating, and very nice man running the place. The food was very good and I would have been happy just eating the salad and pickled veggies. Lots of cucumbers and tomatoes with romaine tossed in a light vinaigrette with feta cheese. 
The gyro plate was good but very different than any other gyro I've had. This meat was not shaved off like typical but seemed to be formed into thin long strips and then grilled? The rice was beautifully seasoned and delicious. 
I also ordered the falafels (unfortunately could t just purchase one or two so had to get the entire order of six). They were fresh and crispy with a great garlic sauce to dip in. I also enjoyed them with the tzatziki sauce. 
My only complaint was the pita bread. It was very dry and a bit hard. Definitely not up to par with the rest of the food. 
Overall good visit and I would come back.

Today was our first time dining at Pita Shawarma for lunch. We ordered the chicken shawarma, gyro wrap & mix shawarma plate.  The gyro was the highlight. The meat was tender & flavorful. The mix shawarma plate included a salad & hummus.  Everything was good & the cashier was very friendly!

5 stars
Simply amazing!  The flavor, the service both tops!  Happy we tried Pita Shawarma! 

We didn't want a lot of food, so experience is limited.  Gyro wrap and Beef Shawarma were both fire!  The hummus we got was incredible as well! 

I look forward to trying more on my return visit - and I'm already counting the days!

5 stars
I got the beef shawarma & it was very yummy. juicy and flavorful! Nadeer greeted us with warm smiles; will be returning!

4 stars
The food was packed with flavor and the portions were huge. We took home our leftovers and they were just as tasty the next day.  The shawarma was a bit dry, but our absolute favorite was the beef kabob.  We can't wait to add this place into our local restaurant rotation! Love supporting neighborhood spots!

5 stars

5 stars
Really great food and chill atmosphere! The Gyro Combo was delicious. Would recommend!

2 stars
Good was bland. Location is small. Felt like a fish in a fishbowl when I walked in. The service not good. 

I had to wait at the counter to place an order. Waited for over 15min before someone came out. Mind you, this is after I tried using Uber eats to place an order but got a message stating this location isn't accepting orders. Also tried calling prior to my arrival but the ph# on Google was incorrect and the Yelp ph# only kept ringing with no answer. 

Finally someone comes out. I place an order, wait 20min. Get my order. I get home and it's the wrong order. I stated exactly what was listed on the menu. They said I placed the wrong order. Not wanting to argue, I asked if I could place another order in exchange. They stated no. I asked for a refund, they also said no. 

I'm giving them 2 stars only because I don't like bashing small businesses but my experience was inexcusable.
Good luck to anyone who goes here

Slow. It takes way too long to get your food ( an hr and 15 minutes) when you go here. We ended up asking for our order to be cancelled and it worked out because it wasn't even made yet. I gave it a 2nd shot because of the great reviews but sadly that was a miss also.. i did it through grub hub this time and went to pickup my salad 45 minutes later to then be told they didn't have the ingredients.. we tried but this is a pass

My two friends and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at Pita Shawarma.  The food was excellent, attractively presented, and very tasty.  The restaurant is small, but attractively done and had a pleasant atmosphere.  Our wait staff was a friendly and attentive Jordanian college student who spoke excellent English.  The BIG question:  would I go back to Pita Shawarma again?  Absolutely!  I wish this restaurant were located in Mansfield so I could go more often because I love Mediterranean cuisine.

Absolutely fresh delicious and packed with flavor. The best hummus, tabouli and in house made pita bread. The lamb was marinated and cooked to perfection. Everything is made in house, fresh and exploding with flavor. There were no leftover. The Ashta custard was so good. My mouth is watering thinking of all this delicious food. I wish they were here in Texas.

5 stars
We ordered the falafel order , chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. One of the best falafel we've tried in dfw. Everything on the plate was so good in particular the garlic sauce in the chicken plate it was so light. Enjoyed our meal so much, very good service as well :) !!

5 stars
From the moment my daughter and I walked into this place, we were greeted by the incredible Nadir, and let me tell you, he transformed our visit into something truly special.

The food? Absolutely delicious. But the experience? Even better, because of him. Nadir's passion for what he does radiates through every interaction. His genuine hospitality, enthusiasm, and dedication made us feel valued in a way that goes far beyond customer service, it felt like a personal connection.

Exceptional service can make or break a dining experience, and Nadir is the reason I'd return without hesitation. This is more than just a place to eat, it's a place where the people make a difference. If you're looking for top-tier food and a top-tier experience, I highly recommend this spot.

5 stars
great food and service. the mixed shawarma was lovely. thanks to the owner who provided dates for us.

5 stars
Great authentic style shawarma. 

Simple yet delicious, and the Cole slaw that comes on the side with fries and picked vegetables are a great compliment. 

My only complaint - I have never received the extra sauce that I pay for when I order for pick up. 

Ambiance is basically a stepped up hole in the wall spot. Casual but great shawarma.

4 stars
I'm so glad this opened up!  I love mediterranean food.  Met up here with a friend on a weekday to catch up and this spot was perfect.  I like to try to eat healthy and the food is really flavorful here.  

I got the falafel wrap and my friend got the tabouleh salad.  Really friendly service and it was pretty quiet.  We were able to take our time and mind you we were there for quite a long lunch!  The wraps are pretty big so I probably could have taken 1/2 of it home for a second meal.

5 stars
Wow, omg the chicken Shwarma!! Chef's kiss!! The meat was so tender and flavorful. The wrap on the outside tasted like heaven as well. At first I thought about asking for extra sauce but I stopped myself. It would have overpowered the tasty chicken. For veggies there were some Lettuce and tomatoes, which adds a nice balance. 

Falafels were also some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy outside and soft inside. The nutty flavor were really shining through. 

For drinks I tried the Saffron tea which is something new and very comforting on a cold winter night. I would definitely be back! 
Wonderful Arabic music playing through through meal was a nice touch and the service was topped notch.

4 stars
I had an interesting experience at this spot. First off, I somehow ended up in the bathroom in the dark--couldn't figure out the lights. Could have very well been a skill issue on my part, but it added a little unintentional adventure to the visit.

Our waitress seemed a bit frazzled, but she was sweet and did her best to accommodate us. We ordered hibiscus tea, but after putting the order, they apparently ran out. They subbed it with something else, with the condition that if we didn't like it, they'd take it off the check. That was a nice gesture, especially considering we were a larger party during lunchtime.

When we arrived, it was pretty empty, with only 3-4 other tables occupied. The food itself was good and flavorful. I had the lamb kabob plate and a gyro, and both were packed with flavor and absolutely delicious. However, I'd suggest being cautious with the pickled items--they were quite sour for my taste. The yogurt drink was also quite sour but felt really healthy when I was drinking it

Overall, the atmosphere was pleasant, and despite a few hiccups, I left satisfied. Worth a visit!

5 stars
This unassuming spot is tucked away in a strip mall next to Tom Thumb. The space small and the tables are open, so not ideal for intimate conversation. But the friendly staff and decor make the ambiance cozy. We were a little intimidated by the authentic menu but our server was kind and patient to explain everything to us. We enjoyed the chicken shawarma Arabic style with pickled vegetables and slaw and the gyro sandwich. The falafel was fresh and flavorful. On our first visit, we were treated to complimentary cashew baklava - which is only had with pistachios. Just a bit of honey made it a slightly sweet ending to our meal. We've gone back twice now and will definitely be including it in our regular rotation of locally-owned restaurants.

Excellent, flavorful, big portions and super filling.

Reminds me of the street carts in New York City, and that's a good thing (I guess?)

Having been to a few Mediterranean places in the area we decided to give this place a try since we were close to it. When we first walked in we noticed how homely the interior looked. It had the feeling of a mom and pop establishment and we felt like we were going to get some good food. I had high hopes especially given the number of good reviews I read about on Yelp. 

However after we ordered our food we quickly became disenchanted with the quality of the restaurant. Since we had a family size group we decided to order the family meal since we have great success with family meals at Mediterranean places in the past. I wasn't too hungry and thought I'd just eat pita and baba ganoush so that is what I ordered. My husband wanted something extra so he ordered the lamb kabob. First came the baba ganoush(not pictured) it was drowned in oil and the pita served with it was cold, not a good start. Next came the chicken shawarma platter, the best part of the platter was the fries, the wraps taste like frozen food that was reheated and they looked nothing like picture on the menu. The exterior of the wraps were almost grey in color and didn't have the typical light and crispy texture that they normally have at any decent Mediterranean place, and they were soggy and dripping in oil. Last came the puny kabob tucked into a piece of pita bread(not pictured), which was an odd and unappetizing way to plate food. In addition, kabob was chewy and lacked decent flavor. My kids were hungry so they ate the greasy food all the while raving about the place we went to in Richardson the week prior. 

To make matters worse the service was sloppy. The poor guy who was very friendly and kind, had to work the register, run the food from the kitchen and wait the tables. He often forgot the things we requested and needed such as utensils. Also be prepared to purchase water since the water isn't filtered and has an off taste. I must say we will not return to this place ever.

We enjoyed the chicken shawarma Arabic style with pickled vegetables and slaw and the gyro sandwich. The falafel was fresh and flavorful. On our first visit, we were treated to complimentary cashew baklava - which is only had with pistachios. Just a bit of honey made it a slightly sweet ending to our meal. We've gone back twice now and will definitely be including it in our regular rotation of locally-owned restaurants.

Excellent, flavorful, big portions and super filling.

Reminds me of the street carts in New York City, and that's a good thing (I guess?)

Having been to a few Mediterranean places in the area we decided to give this place a try since we were close to it. When we first walked in we noticed how homely the interior looked. It had the feeling of a mom and pop establishment and we felt like we were going to get some good food. I had high hopes especially given the number of good reviews I read about on Yelp. 

However after we ordered our food we quickly became disenchanted with the quality of the restaurant. Since we had a family size group we decided to order the family meal since we have great success with family meals at Mediterranean places in the past. I wasn't too hungry and thought I'd just eat pita and baba ganoush so that is what I ordered. My husband wanted something extra so he ordered the lamb kabob. First came the baba ganoush(not pictured) it was drowned in oil and the pita served with it was cold, not a good start. Next came the chicken shawarma platter, the best part of the platter was the fries, the wraps taste like frozen food that was reheated and they looked nothing like picture on the menu. The exterior of the wraps were almost grey in color and didn't have the typical light and crispy texture that they normally have at any decent Mediterranean place, and they were soggy and dripping in oil. Last came the puny kabob tucked into a piece of pita bread(not pictured), which was an odd and unappetizing way to plate food. In addition, kabob was chewy and lacked decent flavor. My kids were hungry so they ate the greasy food all the while raving about the place we went to in Richardson the week prior. 

To make matters worse the service was sloppy. The poor guy who was very friendly and kind, had to work the register, run the food from the kitchen and wait the tables. He often forgot the things we requested and needed such as utensils. Also be prepared to purchase water since the water isn't filtered and has an off taste. I must say we will not return to this place ever.

My husband ordered Pita Shawarma for take out, and the food was delicious! 

I had the beef shawarma rice plate. It came with a side of hummus and a fresh cut salad. The portions were generous.

He noted how friendly the man at the counter was!

Excellent chicken shawarma, indoor seating & really kind server. The outa and hummus was delish too!! Highly recommend giving this small establishment a try.

Welcome to flavor time.  The chicken kabobs are phenomenal, high quality a me tons of flavor.  The garlic sauce is fantastic also great value.

5 stars
The Gyro was full of flavor and deliciousness. The fried chicken was ok. My wife said the coleslaw was not the best but who cares - we're here for the Mediterranean food. 

Anyway, I see why this place have 5 stars. Will definitely be back!

The food was delicious. The portions were large and very reasonably priced. We had the hummus appetizer which came with plenty of warm, fresh pita. The hummus was very flavorful, as well.  We also had the beef shawarma and chicken shawarma sandwiches. Both were delicious. We were able to take half home for another meal! We definitely recommend Pita Shawarma any time you're in the mood for a casual Mediterranean meal!

NEW FAV FOOD PLACE
I'm excited to put this place in my rotation of local food! The portions were huge and DELICIOUS!! 
The place is pretty new-new so there is no soda machine and the water is bottled but honestly I'm coming for the food and it does not disappoint. We got baklava as well as entrees and took it home for later!
The guys serving were super nice and knowledgeable too! 
I think their sandwiches will do really well when the school year starts again and students from the senior high are looking for off-campus lunch! 

10/10 recommend!

5 stars
Great service and food! Seasoning is perfect. We tried the mixed plate to try a bit of everything and couldn't decide on a favorite because it was all so good.

The only place that reminded me of shawarma from Jordan in all of Texas. The chicken is so flavorful and the owner is so welcoming.

The food is FANTASTIC! A must visit for this area! If you're traveling through Plano and you're looking for some awesome Mediterranean food then this is your place.

Hello everyone.

Since I come from the Caucasus, we have a sufficiently developed shawarma. Hoping to try delicious shawarma in the USA, I was surprised how not tasty it was.

Why serve sweet cabbage with shawarma?

Why does the beef sauce give bitterness?

Shawarma with beef 4/10

Shawarma with chicken 8/10

5 stars
Great food! You need to try it out. Open late and friendly service. Location is very convenient for central Plano.

5 stars
Chicken shawarma was really good, we can taste the freshness of the bread, perfectly toasted to add a bit of crisp. Chicken was moist and well marinated and the sauce in the wrap was amazing .

5 stars
Excellent hospitality. Excellent service. Excellent food.

We had the Chicken and the Beef Shawarma plates. Very fresh, very delicious. 

We'll be back, and we'll tell all our friends too.

Thanks!

Ordered the mixed plate. Thought it was kind of expensive on Uber eats ($23) but it was a monster plate of food with pitas. Salad was delicious with generous amount of cheese. Pita was flavorful and so was the hummus. The meats were cooked and spiced perfectly. The rice was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. Amazing, new favorite spot.

5 stars
First: the ambiance. So I messed up and only orders fries via Uber eats pick up.  So the guy at the counter was nice enough to take my order and explain my mistake .

Despite my mess-up, the food came out in a timely manner! I also got the peach barbican and it was so good!

When I came home and finally tasted the food, I can conclude that this is one of the best fries I've had in my life. It was crisp and perfectly seasoned. The falafel tasted very fresh! However, I will request to have the sauce on the side next time since it was too wet by the time I got to eat if.

I will definitely be back!

5 stars
Incredible food and even better service. This is now our new favorite spot. Highly recommend.

I ordered lamb kabob.  Quality of meat and flavor was so good.
Overall, I prefer real silver wears for eat in, not plastic ones.

"This will be the best shawarma you've ever had!" I enjoyed the enthusiasm from presumably the owner after he took our order and we sat down.

While it wasn't bad, it certainly didn't come close to Sara's in Richardson. The chicken was a bit dry honestly and no amount of sauce could cover that up. It did make it quite greasy though and unpleasant to sit with.

I wouldn't order the beef plate again. The meat was also quite dry. I also wasn't a fan of the salas or neon veggie mix. They season the meat and rice extremely well though. Unfortunately that meant most of my bites had whole pieces of coriander, clove, and mace that were quite potent and could probably chip a tooth. 

I'm sure this spot will become quite popular with student and people in the area. The ownership is also very proud and the service is great. Overall though, there are better spots around town. I would come back here if I was in the area though.

5 stars
I had a great experience. The staff were nice, the food was great, and the food arrived in a relatively  fast speed. I enjoyed my food and trying shawarmas for the first time here was a definite 10/10. Thank you for the amazing food!

4 stars
Ample parking, plenty of seating, and very nice man running the place. The food was very good and I would have been happy just eating the salad and pickled veggies. Lots of cucumbers and tomatoes with romaine tossed in a light vinaigrette with feta cheese. 
The gyro plate was good but very different than any other gyro I've had. This meat was not shaved off like typical but seemed to be formed into thin long strips and then grilled? The rice was beautifully seasoned and delicious. 
I also ordered the falafels (unfortunately could t just purchase one or two so had to get the entire order of six). They were fresh and crispy with a great garlic sauce to dip in. I also enjoyed them with the tzatziki sauce. 
My only complaint was the pita bread. It was very dry and a bit hard. Definitely not up to par with the rest of the food. 
Overall good visit and I would come back.

Today was our first time dining at Pita Shawarma for lunch. We ordered the chicken shawarma, gyro wrap & mix shawarma plate.  The gyro was the highlight. The meat was tender & flavorful. The mix shawarma plate included a salad & hummus.  Everything was good & the cashier was very friendly!

5 stars
Simply amazing!  The flavor, the service both tops!  Happy we tried Pita Shawarma! 

We didn't want a lot of food, so experience is limited.  Gyro wrap and Beef Shawarma were both fire!  The hummus we got was incredible as well! 

I look forward to trying more on my return visit - and I'm already counting the days!

I got the beef shawarma & it was very yummy. juicy and flavorful! Nadeer greeted us with warm smiles; will be returning!

The food was packed with flavor and the portions were huge. We took home our leftovers and they were just as tasty the next day.  The shawarma was a bit dry, but our absolute favorite was the beef kabob.  We can't wait to add this place into our local restaurant rotation! Love supporting neighborhood spots!

2 stars
Good was bland. Location is small. Felt like a fish in a fishbowl when I walked in. The service not good. 

I had to wait at the counter to place an order. Waited for over 15min before someone came out. Mind you, this is after I tried using Uber eats to place an order but got a message stating this location isn't accepting orders. Also tried calling prior to my arrival but the ph# on Google was incorrect and the Yelp ph# only kept ringing with no answer. 

Finally someone comes out. I place an order, wait 20min. Get my order. I get home and it's the wrong order. I stated exactly what was listed on the menu. They said I placed the wrong order. Not wanting to argue, I asked if I could place another order in exchange. They stated no. I asked for a refund, they also said no. 

I'm giving them 2 stars only because I don't like bashing small businesses but my experience was inexcusable.
Good luck to anyone who goes here

Nadir was awesome! And the food was even better. My wife and I both got a shawarma wrap! It was very flavorful and good portion. Will be back!

Slow. It takes way too long to get your food ( an hr and 15 minutes) when you go here. We ended up asking for our order to be cancelled and it worked out because it wasn't even made yet. I gave it a 2nd shot because of the great reviews but sadly that was a miss also.. i did it through grub hub this time and went to pickup my salad 45 minutes later to then be told they didn't have the ingredients.. we tried but this is a pass

5 stars
This is my first time at this restaurant.   But I will definitely be back.  The kebobs were flavorful, the rice yummy, and the hummus creamy.   The service was also delightful .

My two friends and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at Pita Shawarma.  The food was excellent, attractively presented, and very tasty.  The restaurant is small, but attractively done and had a pleasant atmosphere.  Our wait staff was a friendly and attentive Jordanian college student who spoke excellent English.  The BIG question:  would I go back to Pita Shawarma again?  Absolutely!  I wish this restaurant were located in Mansfield so I could go more often because I love Mediterranean cuisine.

Absolutely fresh delicious and packed with flavor. The best hummus, tabouli and in house made pita bread. The lamb was marinated and cooked to perfection. Everything is made in house, fresh and exploding with flavor. There were no leftover. The Ashta custard was so good. My mouth is watering thinking of all this delicious food. I wish they were here in Texas.

We ordered the falafel order , chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. One of the best falafel we've tried in dfw. Everything on the plate was so good in particular the garlic sauce in the chicken plate it was so light. Enjoyed our meal so much, very good service as well :) !!
