Review: We just moved from Colorado and I'm unsure if it's just difference in state or if this store just really skimped on everything. In Colorado, the calzones took up over half the trays, and the mini murph (for our son) had dough that came up to the edges and the dough was soft and thicker... his dough also felt thin and dry at the edges.

After cooking, the taste was also just not good at all. Really upset because we love Papa Murphy's calzones and my son loves building his own pizza but will probably try a different location in the future.

Review: Awful customer service. Was told I can't buy a gluten free crust with just olive oil so I can make my wife her own pizza with organic ingredients.  I will never buy anything from this place ever again

Review: The best way to describe this Papa Murphy's franchise is to tell you it is the Chick-fil-A of pizza. Hands-down the most excellent staff and customer service I've ever experienced at a pizza chain. Shane, the manager is awesome. I watched him coach and encourage his team members. Tony & Gabe took my order and created the most beautiful Chicken Bacon Stuffed Crust Pizza. Definitely a work of art. Kind of impressive to look at, too. Did I mention delicious? Yes, it was. Just from the ordering and watching them make my pizza, I knew I would be back. I signed up in store for the loyalty program and have $3 off on my next pizza. Sweet! Give this location a visit. Specials on Tues night. Check the website for the most up to date info. You can order ahead there, too but I encourage you to stop by and order in person. This is my second visit and left me equally impressed with the staff, store and my food. Enjoy

Review: We have been living in this neighborhood for over 2 years and hadn't got a pizza from this place and this is just 2 minute drive. I am wondering WHY?

We got a 14" Thin Crust Garden Veggie and it was an absolute delight. The amount of veggies were just right, the sauce was right, the cheese was right and all the ingredients were fresh. 

The baking instructions were perfect and we got a perfect pizza. No more delivery pizza for us from now on!

Review: I love Papa Murphys so I was incredibly excited to find out there was one just down the street from our new house. I placed my order online and my husband went to pick it up. He said he walked in, told them his name, was handed the pizza's and was on his way. Completely painless. I really like that they have an online ordering option. Sometimes I don't trust people taking my order over the phone so it's nice to do it online and see in print what you ordered confirmed. 

The pizzas turned out great. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza with jalapeños on a gluten free crust. I love their gluten free crust! It's a thin crust that cooks perfectly crispy. It has a great flavor to it! 

We will definitely be returning to this location for our pizza nights!

Review: Worst experience ever and my first time at a Papa Murphy's! Rude! I had ordered earlier for a pick up at 1:15. I was late. I walked in with a smile and told him I was there for a pick up. He looked like he couldn't find it. Asked if it was call I Ordered online. I said I ordered from the app. He looked at me and said in a sarcastic tone"that's online" like I was stupid! I said "Well forg and before I got it out he then said they will be on the rack. There was 1 pizza and I said that's not my order I have 4 pizza's.  He said well I have them in the back cuz "we don't let them sit out" also sarcastic! Then he threw my pizzas on the counter and it's not a flat counter. I said thank you and I will never be back. Yes, I was 1 1/2 hours late. I ordered before they opened and didn't realize my drs appts would run that late. If I hadn't already spent $45 I would have walked out. My first and last time I'll go to another Papa Murphy's! I left VERY UPSET!

Review: This Papa Murphy's location gets it right.  We usually get a pizza every week and they are always exactly what I ordered and they are always on the rack when I walk in the door at my appointed time.  The pizza is yummy and easily on par with takeout joints costing 50% more.  I'd rather cook my own because fully 25% of pizzas I get from takeout places have overcooked the pizza and the crust is nearly burnt on the bottom.

Review: We've been getting pizza at this location for several years, but the service has declined significantly over the last couple of months.  This past weekend we visited the store to order a pizza and I've never had as much trouble placing an order as I did.  It literally took multiple tries to explain what I wanted and it wasn't that complicated.  This after waiting several minutes for someone to stop talking in the back and come out to take my order.  The guy making pizzas never offered a greeting or said some one would be with me in a minute.  Extremely frustrating experience.  The time before the same guy told my husband that you couldn't order a large pizza with thin crust, which we've been ordering for years.  The staff obviously needs more training.

Review: I don't know about you guys, but I am sick and tired of the big box delivery places (papa john's, dominoes). With all the extra fees/charges they try to sneak in on you, a $20 order becomes $40 somehow when you check out. Do they think I'm stupid? Anyway, Papa Murphy's is a great value, the family size pies are huge and priced really well and a 5 minute drive and 10-15 minutes cooking time and you save a ton of money! Just get the oven preheating before you leave to get the pies. With the honey browser extension you can usually knock of a significant discount too! I also echo what everyone else is saying, the customer service at this location is great!

Review: This is the friendliest of all of the local Papa Murphy's in the Plano/Richardson area. Pizza is freshly prepared, with a smile and a side of friendly conversation. Papa Murphy's pizza isn't necessarily going to top your "best of" pizza rankings, but they are tasty and at a good price point.

Review: Today was actually my first time trying Papa Murphy's. My experience went amazingly well. I want to put an emphasis on the service. I've worked in the service industry, and I truly value good customer service. As I walked through the door, I was greeted with a friendly "Welcome to Papa Murphy's," and I was immediately assisted by an employee. The employees were incredibly friendly and made my pizza efficiently and accurately. Regarding the pizza, although I had to bake the pizza at home, it was incredibly easy to follow the baking instructions for the pizza. I ordered the original pan crusted pizza, and after it was baked, the ingredients and especially the pizza dough tasted fresh. I will definitely go back to Papa Murphy's in the future.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I was a little confused when I picked up my pizza ... COLD. I guess I didn't read into the business enough to know that it sells customized ready-to-bake pizzas. My fault, which is why I'm not giving a low rating

Papa Murphys deserves all 5 stars. This is one of the most delicious pizzas I've had and I somewhat like that I can cook it myself. Sometimes pizza places cook it took long or not long enough. Baking instructions are included and had no issues whatsover during that process. 

Will be back again & will recommend

Review: Having just moved here my wife and I were looking for a place to quickly pick up food after a long night.  We ordered poppa Murphy's pizza and when we picked it up it was late into evening only to find out it's not cooked.  They do advertise it's not but because we've never seen a pizza place sell non cooked pizzas we were definitely surprised.  After cooking pizza we felt pizza was a 3.5 out of 5.  We may order again but not likely.

Review: We ordered online at 5pm so that we could pick up at the online order pick-up register at 5:30pm pick up time that they gave us online. I get there and there is a line going to the front register. So I get in line because no one is at the online order pick up register. Then one of their employees asked me what I'm there for and I said I'm here to pick up an order we ordered online and he asked me the name I gave it and he found two of my pizzas but said that I needed to pay at the front register for my mini murph's and cookie dough. Meanwhile I had stepped out of line 2 talk with him and three other people walked in behind me and got in line so I lost my place in the line to the register. So then after waiting in line again I got up to the front and they are out of mini murphs... so I have to wait for those to be made. After paying I waited and waited and waited. Meanwhile the employees are having a powwow at one end of the pizza making Lane and I am getting more and more irate that the pizzas we ordered at 5 are not even being attended to. Finally I asked them to please finish making my mini Murphy's so I could leave. This place has seen the last dime of my money.

Review: I like the fresh ingredients here, and the prices are great. The staff at this location is friendly & helpful, I just struggle with how greasy their pizza always seems to come out! Not sure what is causing it, because when I make pizzas at home it doesn't happen. I'm wondering if their crust just doesn't absorb some of the oils that other doughs do. Either way, my kiddo likes the little mini-pizzas and they always give her a sticker (which is like proposing to a twenty-something on the scale of excitement), so we'll keep going for her!

Review: I finally tried Papa Murphy's. my friends all like it and I had a coupon. I ordered the garlic chicken specialty pizza and I just didn't like it. They were stingy with the ingredients, the cheese tasted cheap and fake. I had an awful garlic taste in my mouth all night. I felt like I got ripped off even with my coupon and would have been really mad if I had paid full price. Seriously, I have had frozen pizzas that were much better. On the other hand, Sweetie had a pepperoni/sausage special that is always $5 and he was perfectly happy with it. The store was clean and the employees were cheerful. Is it just me?

Review: I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this pizza was!!! I gave it a try because of their Friday's specials and I got a free pizza coupon from one of their texting promotions... I am so glad I tried it!!  This pizza is made by them and baked at home, which is perfect for us because we can have it hot and fresh whenever we want it.  I have been trying to find an affordable yet super yummy pizza so we can have a GOTO takeout pizza place and -- I FOUND IT!!! The pan pizza was awesome & the XLNY pizzas were great too!  I cant wait to try a stuffed pizza.  If you are looking for a great tasting pizza, signup for Papa Murphy's texting deals and give their pizza a try, they have great deals every Tuesday and Friday.  My family REALLY loves it & you can just pop it in the oven anytime you are ready for fresh hot pizza!!!  So easy and so YUMMY!  I used to buy Walmart's fresh pizza and add my own toppings but this pizza BEATS that by far!  Try their creamy garlic sauce, it's Fabulous! You won't believe it until you try it!  Their staff is wonderfully friendly and chipper.... Thank you!

Review: Excited to see another Papa Murphy's open up, this time close to my house - YAY!  Papa Murphy's is take 'n' bake, so don't be surprised when they hand you an uncooked pizza.  It's actually really good.  I can take the pizza home and if my family isn't all in one place, I can toss it in the fridge till we're ready to eat.  After 10-15 minutes in my oven (thin crust they call delite), the pizza is bubbly and has a beautifully brown cracker thin crust.  No joke, this thin crust could go up against the gourmet pizzas you get at those trendy wine bars.  Oh wait, I didn't talk about the toppings yet.  They have fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts - and of course all the usual pizza topping suspects.  Here's what I'm really hooked on...their creamy garlic sauce.  OMG.  You put anything on top of their garlic creamy goodness and it's transformed into something really special.  I really can't say enough, but just try it for yourself.  I used to pick up take 'n' bake pizzas at the grocery/club stores - Papa Murphy's doesn't even belong in the same consideration set.  The two cannot be compared.

Review: We got pizza here for the first time last week.  The staff was very helpful.  We don't order the specialty pizzas, we have our own favorite we like to create.  They did a good job and the pizza was very good.  I ended up getting 2 salads that I really didn't need and threw them away the following day because they the greens were turning brown.  Overall, I spent more money than I planned to BUT, we did get a great pizza and we will go back to place our special pizza order again.

And - my experience has been equally positive in other parts of the country - quality is consistent no matter where I am.  Recently visited my parents in Indianapolis and was so pleased to find out there is a PM's right around the corner from them - they're not big pizza eaters but I insisted we get a pizza and they raved about Papa Murphy's.  On my way to pick up a few pizzas right now!

Tony & Gabe took my order and created the most beautiful Chicken Bacon Stuffed Crust Pizza. Definitely a work of art. Kind of impressive to look at, too. Did I mention delicious? Yes, it was. Just from the ordering and watching them make my pizza, I knew I would be back. I signed up in store for the loyalty program and have $3 off on my next pizza. Sweet! Give this location a visit. Specials on Tues night. Check the website for the most up to date info. You can order ahead there, too but I encourage you to stop by and order in person. This is my second visit and left me equally impressed with the staff, store and my food. Enjoy

Review: We have been living in this neighborhood for over 2 years and hadn't got a pizza from this place and this is just 2 minute drive. I am wondering WHY?

We got a 14" Thin Crust Garden Veggie and it was an absolute delight. The amount of veggies were just right, the sauce was right, the cheese was right and all the ingredients were fresh. 

The baking instructions were perfect and we got a perfect pizza. No more delivery pizza for us from now on!

Review: I love Papa Murphys so I was incredibly excited to find out there was one just down the street from our new house. I placed my order online and my husband went to pick it up. He said he walked in, told them his name, was handed the pizza's and was on his way. Completely painless. I really like that they have an online ordering option. Sometimes I don't trust people taking my order over the phone so it's nice to do it online and see in print what you ordered confirmed. 

The pizzas turned out great. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza with jalapeños on a gluten free crust. I love their gluten free crust! It's a thin crust that cooks perfectly crispy. It has a great flavor to it! 

We will definitely be returning to this location for our pizza nights!

Review: Worst experience ever and my first time at a Papa Murphy's! Rude! I had ordered earlier for a pick up at 1:15. I was late. I walked in with a smile and told him I was there for a pick up. He looked like he couldn't find it. Asked if it was call I Ordered online. I said I ordered from the app. He looked at me and said in a sarcastic tone"that's online" like I was stupid! I said "Well forg and before I got it out he then said they will be on the rack. There was 1 pizza and I said that's not my order I have 4 pizza's.  He said well I have them in the back cuz "we don't let them sit out" also sarcastic! Then he threw my pizzas on the counter and it's not a flat counter. I said thank you and I will never be back. Yes, I was 1 1/2 hours late. I ordered before they opened and didn't realize my drs appts would run that late. If I hadn't already spent $45 I would have walked out. My first and last time I'll go to another Papa Murphy's! I left VERY UPSET!

Review: This Papa Murphy's location gets it right.  We usually get a pizza every week and they are always exactly what I ordered and they are always on the rack when I walk in the door at my appointed time.  The pizza is yummy and easily on par with takeout joints costing 50% more.  I'd rather cook my own because fully 25% of pizzas I get from takeout places have overcooked the pizza and the crust is nearly burnt on the bottom.

Review: We've been getting pizza at this location for several years, but the service has declined significantly over the last couple of months.  This past weekend we visited the store to order a pizza and I've never had as much trouble placing an order as I did.  It literally took multiple tries to explain what I wanted and it wasn't that complicated.  This after waiting several minutes for someone to stop talking in the back and come out to take my order.  The guy making pizzas never offered a greeting or said some one would be with me in a minute.  Extremely frustrating experience.  The time before the same guy told my husband that you couldn't order a large pizza with thin crust, which we've been ordering for years.  The staff obviously needs more training.

Review: I don't know about you guys, but I am sick and tired of the big box delivery places (papa john's, dominoes). With all the extra fees/charges they try to sneak in on you, a $20 order becomes $40 somehow when you check out. Do they think I'm stupid? Anyway, Papa Murphy's is a great value, the family size pies are huge and priced really well and a 5 minute drive and 10-15 minutes cooking time and you save a ton of money! Just get the oven preheating before you leave to get the pies. With the honey browser extension you can usually knock of a significant discount too! I also echo what everyone else is saying, the customer service at this location is great!

Review: This is the friendliest of all of the local Papa Murphy's in the Plano/Richardson area. Pizza is freshly prepared, with a smile and a side of friendly conversation. Papa Murphy's pizza isn't necessarily going to top your "best of" pizza rankings, but they are tasty and at a good price point.

Review: Today was actually my first time trying Papa Murphy's. My experience went amazingly well. I want to put an emphasis on the service. I've worked in the service industry, and I truly value good customer service. As I walked through the door, I was greeted with a friendly "Welcome to Papa Murphy's," and I was immediately assisted by an employee. The employees were incredibly friendly and made my pizza efficiently and accurately. Regarding the pizza, although I had to bake the pizza at home, it was incredibly easy to follow the baking instructions for the pizza. I ordered the original pan crusted pizza, and after it was baked, the ingredients and especially the pizza dough tasted fresh. I will definitely go back to Papa Murphy's in the future.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I was a little confused when I picked up my pizza ... COLD. I guess I didn't read into the business enough to know that it sells customized ready-to-bake pizzas. My fault, which is why I'm not giving a low rating

Papa Murphys deserves all 5 stars. This is one of the most delicious pizzas I've had and I somewhat like that I can cook it myself. Sometimes pizza places cook it took long or not long enough. Baking instructions are included and had no issues whatsover during that process. 

Will be back again & will recommend

Review: Having just moved here my wife and I were looking for a place to quickly pick up food after a long night.  We ordered poppa Murphy's pizza and when we picked it up it was late into evening only to find out it's not cooked.  They do advertise it's not but because we've never seen a pizza place sell non cooked pizzas we were definitely surprised.  After cooking pizza we felt pizza was a 3.5 out of 5.  We may order again but not likely.

Review: We ordered online at 5pm so that we could pick up at the online order pick-up register at 5:30pm pick up time that they gave us online. I get there and there is a line going to the front register. So I get in line because no one is at the online order pick up register. Then one of their employees asked me what I'm there for and I said I'm here to pick up an order we ordered online and he asked me the name I gave it and he found two of my pizzas but said that I needed to pay at the front register for my mini murph's and cookie dough. Meanwhile I had stepped out of line 2 talk with him and three other people walked in behind me and got in line so I lost my place in the line to the register. So then after waiting in line again I got up to the front and they are out of mini murphs... so I have to wait for those to be made. After paying I waited and waited and waited. Meanwhile the employees are having a powwow at one end of the pizza making Lane and I am getting more and more irate that the pizzas we ordered at 5 are not even being attended to. Finally I asked them to please finish making my mini Murphy's so I could leave. This place has seen the last dime of my money.

Review: I like the fresh ingredients here, and the prices are great. The staff at this location is friendly & helpful, I just struggle with how greasy their pizza always seems to come out! Not sure what is causing it, because when I make pizzas at home it doesn't happen. I'm wondering if their crust just doesn't absorb some of the oils that other doughs do. Either way, my kiddo likes the little mini-pizzas and they always give her a sticker (which is like proposing to a twenty-something on the scale of excitement), so we'll keep going for her!

Review: I finally tried Papa Murphy's. my friends all like it and I had a coupon. I ordered the garlic chicken specialty pizza and I just didn't like it. They were stingy with the ingredients, the cheese tasted cheap and fake. I had an awful garlic taste in my mouth all night. I felt like I got ripped off even with my coupon and would have been really mad if I had paid full price. Seriously, I have had frozen pizzas that were much better. On the other hand, Sweetie had a pepperoni/sausage special that is always $5 and he was perfectly happy with it. The store was clean and the employees were cheerful. Is it just me?

Review: I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this pizza was!!! I gave it a try because of their Friday's specials and I got a free pizza coupon from one of their texting promotions... I am so glad I tried it!!  This pizza is made by them and baked at home, which is perfect for us because we can have it hot and fresh whenever we want it.  I have been trying to find an affordable yet super yummy pizza so we can have a GOTO takeout pizza place and -- I FOUND IT!!! The pan pizza was awesome & the XLNY pizzas were great too!  I cant wait to try a stuffed pizza.  If you are looking for a great tasting pizza, signup for Papa Murphy's texting deals and give their pizza a try, they have great deals every Tuesday and Friday.  My family REALLY loves it & you can just pop it in the oven anytime you are ready for fresh hot pizza!!!  So easy and so YUMMY!  I used to buy Walmart's fresh pizza and add my own toppings but this pizza BEATS that by far!  Try their creamy garlic sauce, it's Fabulous! You won't believe it until you try it!  Their staff is wonderfully friendly and chipper.... Thank you!

Review: Excited to see another Papa Murphy's open up, this time close to my house - YAY!  Papa Murphy's is take 'n' bake, so don't be surprised when they hand you an uncooked pizza.  It's actually really good.  I can take the pizza home and if my family isn't all in one place, I can toss it in the fridge till we're ready to eat.  After 10-15 minutes in my oven (thin crust they call delite), the pizza is bubbly and has a beautifully brown cracker thin crust.  No joke, this thin crust could go up against the gourmet pizzas you get at those trendy wine bars.  Oh wait, I didn't talk about the toppings yet.  They have fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts - and of course all the usual pizza topping suspects.  Here's what I'm really hooked on...their creamy garlic sauce.  OMG.  You put anything on top of their garlic creamy goodness and it's transformed into something really special.  I really can't say enough, but just try it for yourself.  I used to pick up take 'n' bake pizzas at the grocery/club stores - Papa Murphy's doesn't even belong in the same consideration set.  The two cannot be compared.

Review: We got pizza here for the first time last week.  The staff was very helpful.  We don't order the specialty pizzas, we have our own favorite we like to create.  They did a good job and the pizza was very good.  I ended up getting 2 salads that I really didn't need and threw them away the following day because they the greens were turning brown.  Overall, I spent more money than I planned to BUT, we did get a great pizza and we will go back to place our special pizza order again.

Review: I LOVE Papa Murphy's - it's the best pizza I think I've ever had.  I always order extra cheese and thin crust.  It's the only pizza I ever buy.  Their lasagna is really wonderful, too!  And - my experience has been equally positive in other parts of the country - quality is consistent no matter where I am.  Recently visited my parents in Indianapolis and was so pleased to find out there is a PM's right around the corner from them - they're not big pizza eaters but I insisted we get a pizza and they raved about Papa Murphy's.  On my way to pick up a few pizzas right now!

Review: We just moved from Colorado and I'm unsure if it's just difference in state or if this store just really skimped on everything. In Colorado, the calzones took up over half the trays, and the mini murph (for our son) had dough that came up to the edges and the dough was soft and thicker... his dough also felt thin and dry at the edges.

After cooking, the taste was also just not good at all. Really upset because we love Papa Murphy's calzones and my son loves building his own pizza but will probably try a different location in the future.

Review: We have been living in this neighborhood for over 2 years and hadn't got a pizza from this place and this is just 2 minute drive. I am wondering WHY?

We got a 14" Thin Crust Garden Veggie and it was an absolute delight. The amount of veggies were just right, the sauce was right, the cheese was right and all the ingredients were fresh. 

The baking instructions were perfect and we got a perfect pizza. No more delivery pizza for us from now on!

Review: I love Papa Murphys so I was incredibly excited to find out there was one just down the street from our new house. I placed my order online and my husband went to pick it up. He said he walked in, told them his name, was handed the pizza's and was on his way. Completely painless. I really like that they have an online ordering option. Sometimes I don't trust people taking my order over the phone so it's nice to do it online and see in print what you ordered confirmed. 

The pizzas turned out great. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza with jalapeños on a gluten free crust. I love their gluten free crust! It's a thin crust that cooks perfectly crispy. It has a great flavor to it! 

We will definitely be returning to this location for our pizza nights!

Review: Worst experience ever and my first time at a Papa Murphy's! Rude! I had ordered earlier for a pick up at 1:15. I was late. I walked in with a smile and told him I was there for a pick up. He looked like he couldn't find it. Asked if it was call I Ordered online. I said I ordered from the app. He looked at me and said in a sarcastic tone"that's online" like I was stupid! I said "Well forg and before I got it out he then said they will be on the rack. There was 1 pizza and I said that's not my order I have 4 pizza's.  He said well I have them in the back cuz "we don't let them sit out" also sarcastic! Then he threw my pizzas on the counter and it's not a flat counter. I said thank you and I will never be back. Yes, I was 1 1/2 hours late. I ordered before they opened and didn't realize my drs appts would run that late. If I hadn't already spent $45 I would have walked out. My first and last time I'll go to another Papa Murphy's! I left VERY UPSET!

Review: This Papa Murphy's location gets it right.  We usually get a pizza every week and they are always exactly what I ordered and they are always on the rack when I walk in the door at my appointed time.  The pizza is yummy and easily on par with takeout joints costing 50% more.  I'd rather cook my own because fully 25% of pizzas I get from takeout places have overcooked the pizza and the crust is nearly burnt on the bottom.

Review: We've been getting pizza at this location for several years, but the service has declined significantly over the last couple of months.  This past weekend we visited the store to order a pizza and I've never had as much trouble placing an order as I did.  It literally took multiple tries to explain what I wanted and it wasn't that complicated.  This after waiting several minutes for someone to stop talking in the back and come out to take my order.  The guy making pizzas never offered a greeting or said some one would be with me in a minute.  Extremely frustrating experience.  The time before the same guy told my husband that you couldn't order a large pizza with thin crust, which we've been ordering for years.  The staff obviously needs more training.

Review: I don't know about you guys, but I am sick and tired of the big box delivery places (papa john's, dominoes). With all the extra fees/charges they try to sneak in on you, a $20 order becomes $40 somehow when you check out. Do they think I'm stupid? Anyway, Papa Murphy's is a great value, the family size pies are huge and priced really well and a 5 minute drive and 10-15 minutes cooking time and you save a ton of money! Just get the oven preheating before you leave to get the pies. With the honey browser extension you can usually knock of a significant discount too! I also echo what everyone else is saying, the customer service at this location is great!

Review: This is the friendliest of all of the local Papa Murphy's in the Plano/Richardson area. Pizza is freshly prepared, with a smile and a side of friendly conversation. Papa Murphy's pizza isn't necessarily going to top your "best of" pizza rankings, but they are tasty and at a good price point.

Review: Today was actually my first time trying Papa Murphy's. My experience went amazingly well. I want to put an emphasis on the service. I've worked in the service industry, and I truly value good customer service. As I walked through the door, I was greeted with a friendly "Welcome to Papa Murphy's," and I was immediately assisted by an employee. The employees were incredibly friendly and made my pizza efficiently and accurately. Regarding the pizza, although I had to bake the pizza at home, it was incredibly easy to follow the baking instructions for the pizza. I ordered the original pan crusted pizza, and after it was baked, the ingredients and especially the pizza dough tasted fresh. I will definitely go back to Papa Murphy's in the future.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I was a little confused when I picked up my pizza ... COLD. I guess I didn't read into the business enough to know that it sells customized ready-to-bake pizzas. My fault, which is why I'm not giving a low rating

Papa Murphys deserves all 5 stars. This is one of the most delicious pizzas I've had and I somewhat like that I can cook it myself. Sometimes pizza places cook it took long or not long enough. Baking instructions are included and had no issues whatsover during that process. 

Will be back again & will recommend

Review: Having just moved here my wife and I were looking for a place to quickly pick up food after a long night.  We ordered poppa Murphy's pizza and when we picked it up it was late into evening only to find out it's not cooked.  They do advertise it's not but because we've never seen a pizza place sell non cooked pizzas we were definitely surprised.  After cooking pizza we felt pizza was a 3.5 out of 5.  We may order again but not likely.

Review: We ordered online at 5pm so that we could pick up at the online order pick-up register at 5:30pm pick up time that they gave us online. I get there and there is a line going to the front register. So I get in line because no one is at the online order pick up register. Then one of their employees asked me what I'm there for and I said I'm here to pick up an order we ordered online and he asked me the name I gave it and he found two of my pizzas but said that I needed to pay at the front register for my mini murph's and cookie dough. Meanwhile I had stepped out of line 2 talk with him and three other people walked in behind me and got in line so I lost my place in the line to the register. So then after waiting in line again I got up to the front and they are out of mini murphs... so I have to wait for those to be made. After paying I waited and waited and waited. Meanwhile the employees are having a powwow at one end of the pizza making Lane and I am getting more and more irate that the pizzas we ordered at 5 are not even being attended to. Finally I asked them to please finish making my mini Murphy's so I could leave. This place has seen the last dime of my money.

Review: I like the fresh ingredients here, and the prices are great. The staff at this location is friendly & helpful, I just struggle with how greasy their pizza always seems to come out! Not sure what is causing it, because when I make pizzas at home it doesn't happen. I'm wondering if their crust just doesn't absorb some of the oils that other doughs do. Either way, my kiddo likes the little mini-pizzas and they always give her a sticker (which is like proposing to a twenty-something on the scale of excitement), so we'll keep going for her!

Review: I finally tried Papa Murphy's. my friends all like it and I had a coupon. I ordered the garlic chicken specialty pizza and I just didn't like it. They were stingy with the ingredients, the cheese tasted cheap and fake. I had an awful garlic taste in my mouth all night. I felt like I got ripped off even with my coupon and would have been really mad if I had paid full price. Seriously, I have had frozen pizzas that were much better. On the other hand, Sweetie had a pepperoni/sausage special that is always $5 and he was perfectly happy with it. The store was clean and the employees were cheerful. Is it just me?

Review: I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this pizza was!!! I gave it a try because of their Friday's specials and I got a free pizza coupon from one of their texting promotions... I am so glad I tried it!!  This pizza is made by them and baked at home, which is perfect for us because we can have it hot and fresh whenever we want it.  I have been trying to find an affordable yet super yummy pizza so we can have a GOTO takeout pizza place and -- I FOUND IT!!! The pan pizza was awesome & the XLNY pizzas were great too!  I cant wait to try a stuffed pizza.  If you are looking for a great tasting pizza, signup for Papa Murphy's texting deals and give their pizza a try, they have great deals every Tuesday and Friday.  My family REALLY loves it & you can just pop it in the oven anytime you are ready for fresh hot pizza!!!  So easy and so YUMMY!  I used to buy Walmart's fresh pizza and add my own toppings but this pizza BEATS that by far!  Try their creamy garlic sauce, it's Fabulous! You won't believe it until you try it!  Their staff is wonderfully friendly and chipper.... Thank you!

Review: Excited to see another Papa Murphy's open up, this time close to my house - YAY!  Papa Murphy's is take 'n' bake, so don't be surprised when they hand you an uncooked pizza.  It's actually really good.  I can take the pizza home and if my family isn't all in one place, I can toss it in the fridge till we're ready to eat.  After 10-15 minutes in my oven (thin crust they call delite), the pizza is bubbly and has a beautifully brown cracker thin crust.  No joke, this thin crust could go up against the gourmet pizzas you get at those trendy wine bars.  Oh wait, I didn't talk about the toppings yet.  They have fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts - and of course all the usual pizza topping suspects.  Here's what I'm really hooked on...their creamy garlic sauce.  OMG.  You put anything on top of their garlic creamy goodness and it's transformed into something really special.  I really can't say enough, but just try it for yourself.  I used to pick up take 'n' bake pizzas at the grocery/club stores - Papa Murphy's doesn't even belong in the same consideration set.  The two cannot be compared.

Review: We got pizza here for the first time last week.  The staff was very helpful.  We don't order the specialty pizzas, we have our own favorite we like to create.  They did a good job and the pizza was very good.  I ended up getting 2 salads that I really didn't need and threw them away the following day because they the greens were turning brown.  Overall, I spent more money than I planned to BUT, we did get a great pizza and we will go back to place our special pizza order again.

Review: I LOVE Papa Murphy's - it's the best pizza I think I've ever had.  I always order extra cheese and thin crust.  It's the only pizza I ever buy.  Their lasagna is really wonderful, too!  And - my experience has been equally positive in other parts of the country - quality is consistent no matter where I am.  Recently visited my parents in Indianapolis and was so pleased to find out there is a PM's right around the corner from them - they're not big pizza eaters but I insisted we get a pizza and they raved about Papa Murphy's.  On my way to pick up a few pizzas right now!

Review: We just moved from Colorado and I'm unsure if it's just difference in state or if this store just really skimped on everything. In Colorado, the calzones took up over half the trays, and the mini murph (for our son) had dough that came up to the edges and the dough was soft and thicker... his dough also felt thin and dry at the edges.

After cooking, the taste was also just not good at all. Really upset because we love Papa Murphy's calzones and my son loves building his own pizza but will probably try a different location in the future.

Review: The best way to describe this Papa Murphy's franchise is to tell you it is the Chick-fil-A of pizza. Hands-down the most excellent staff and customer service I've ever experienced at a pizza chain. Shane, the manager is awesome. I watched him coach and encourage his team members. Tony & Gabe took my order and created the most beautiful Chicken Bacon Stuffed Crust Pizza. Definitely a work of art. Kind of impressive to look at, too. Did I mention delicious? Yes, it was. Just from the ordering and watching them make my pizza, I knew I would be back. I signed up in store for the loyalty program and have $3 off on my next pizza. Sweet! Give this location a visit. Specials on Tues night. Check the website for the most up to date info. You can order ahead there, too but I encourage you to stop by and order in person. This is my second visit and left me equally impressed with the staff, store and my food. Enjoy

The pizzas turned out great. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza with jalapeños on a gluten free crust. I love their gluten free crust! It's a thin crust that cooks perfectly crispy. It has a great flavor to it! 

We will definitely be returning to this location for our pizza nights!

Review: Worst experience ever and my first time at a Papa Murphy's! Rude! I had ordered earlier for a pick up at 1:15. I was late. I walked in with a smile and told him I was there for a pick up. He looked like he couldn't find it. Asked if it was call I Ordered online. I said I ordered from the app. He looked at me and said in a sarcastic tone"that's online" like I was stupid! I said "Well forg and before I got it out he then said they will be on the rack. There was 1 pizza and I said that's not my order I have 4 pizza's.  He said well I have them in the back cuz "we don't let them sit out" also sarcastic! Then he threw my pizzas on the counter and it's not a flat counter. I said thank you and I will never be back. Yes, I was 1 1/2 hours late. I ordered before they opened and didn't realize my drs appts would run that late. If I hadn't already spent $45 I would have walked out. My first and last time I'll go to another Papa Murphy's! I left VERY UPSET!

Review: This Papa Murphy's location gets it right.  We usually get a pizza every week and they are always exactly what I ordered and they are always on the rack when I walk in the door at my appointed time.  The pizza is yummy and easily on par with takeout joints costing 50% more.  I'd rather cook my own because fully 25% of pizzas I get from takeout places have overcooked the pizza and the crust is nearly burnt on the bottom.

Review: We've been getting pizza at this location for several years, but the service has declined significantly over the last couple of months.  This past weekend we visited the store to order a pizza and I've never had as much trouble placing an order as I did.  It literally took multiple tries to explain what I wanted and it wasn't that complicated.  This after waiting several minutes for someone to stop talking in the back and come out to take my order.  The guy making pizzas never offered a greeting or said some one would be with me in a minute.  Extremely frustrating experience.  The time before the same guy told my husband that you couldn't order a large pizza with thin crust, which we've been ordering for years.  The staff obviously needs more training.

Review: I don't know about you guys, but I am sick and tired of the big box delivery places (papa john's, dominoes). With all the extra fees/charges they try to sneak in on you, a $20 order becomes $40 somehow when you check out. Do they think I'm stupid? Anyway, Papa Murphy's is a great value, the family size pies are huge and priced really well and a 5 minute drive and 10-15 minutes cooking time and you save a ton of money! Just get the oven preheating before you leave to get the pies. With the honey browser extension you can usually knock of a significant discount too! I also echo what everyone else is saying, the customer service at this location is great!

Review: This is the friendliest of all of the local Papa Murphy's in the Plano/Richardson area. Pizza is freshly prepared, with a smile and a side of friendly conversation. Papa Murphy's pizza isn't necessarily going to top your "best of" pizza rankings, but they are tasty and at a good price point.

Review: Today was actually my first time trying Papa Murphy's. My experience went amazingly well. I want to put an emphasis on the service. I've worked in the service industry, and I truly value good customer service. As I walked through the door, I was greeted with a friendly "Welcome to Papa Murphy's," and I was immediately assisted by an employee. The employees were incredibly friendly and made my pizza efficiently and accurately. Regarding the pizza, although I had to bake the pizza at home, it was incredibly easy to follow the baking instructions for the pizza. I ordered the original pan crusted pizza, and after it was baked, the ingredients and especially the pizza dough tasted fresh. I will definitely go back to Papa Murphy's in the future.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I was a little confused when I picked up my pizza ... COLD. I guess I didn't read into the business enough to know that it sells customized ready-to-bake pizzas. My fault, which is why I'm not giving a low rating

Papa Murphys deserves all 5 stars. This is one of the most delicious pizzas I've had and I somewhat like that I can cook it myself. Sometimes pizza places cook it took long or not long enough. Baking instructions are included and had no issues whatsover during that process. 

Will be back again & will recommend

Review: Having just moved here my wife and I were looking for a place to quickly pick up food after a long night.  We ordered poppa Murphy's pizza and when we picked it up it was late into evening only to find out it's not cooked.  They do advertise it's not but because we've never seen a pizza place sell non cooked pizzas we were definitely surprised.  After cooking pizza we felt pizza was a 3.5 out of 5.  We may order again but not likely.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: We ordered online at 5pm so that we could pick up at the online order pick-up register at 5:30pm pick up time that they gave us online. I get there and there is a line going to the front register. So I get in line because no one is at the online order pick up register. Then one of their employees asked me what I'm there for and I said I'm here to pick up an order we ordered online and he asked me the name I gave it and he found two of my pizzas but said that I needed to pay at the front register for my mini murph's and cookie dough. Meanwhile I had stepped out of line 2 talk with him and three other people walked in behind me and got in line so I lost my place in the line to the register. So then after waiting in line again I got up to the front and they are out of mini murphs... so I have to wait for those to be made. After paying I waited and waited and waited. Meanwhile the employees are having a powwow at one end of the pizza making Lane and I am getting more and more irate that the pizzas we ordered at 5 are not even being attended to. Finally I asked them to please finish making my mini Murphy's so I could leave. This place has seen the last dime of my money.

Review: I like the fresh ingredients here, and the prices are great. The staff at this location is friendly & helpful, I just struggle with how greasy their pizza always seems to come out! Not sure what is causing it, because when I make pizzas at home it doesn't happen. I'm wondering if their crust just doesn't absorb some of the oils that other doughs do. Either way, my kiddo likes the little mini-pizzas and they always give her a sticker (which is like proposing to a twenty-something on the scale of excitement), so we'll keep going for her!

Review: I finally tried Papa Murphy's. my friends all like it and I had a coupon. I ordered the garlic chicken specialty pizza and I just didn't like it. They were stingy with the ingredients, the cheese tasted cheap and fake. I had an awful garlic taste in my mouth all night. I felt like I got ripped off even with my coupon and would have been really mad if I had paid full price. Seriously, I have had frozen pizzas that were much better. On the other hand, Sweetie had a pepperoni/sausage special that is always $5 and he was perfectly happy with it. The store was clean and the employees were cheerful. Is it just me?

Review: I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this pizza was!!! I gave it a try because of their Friday's specials and I got a free pizza coupon from one of their texting promotions... I am so glad I tried it!!  This pizza is made by them and baked at home, which is perfect for us because we can have it hot and fresh whenever we want it.  I have been trying to find an affordable yet super yummy pizza so we can have a GOTO takeout pizza place and -- I FOUND IT!!! The pan pizza was awesome & the XLNY pizzas were great too!  I cant wait to try a stuffed pizza.  If you are looking for a great tasting pizza, signup for Papa Murphy's texting deals and give their pizza a try, they have great deals every Tuesday and Friday.  My family REALLY loves it & you can just pop it in the oven anytime you are ready for fresh hot pizza!!!  So easy and so YUMMY!  I used to buy Walmart's fresh pizza and add my own toppings but this pizza BEATS that by far!  Try their creamy garlic sauce, it's Fabulous! You won't believe it until you try it!  Their staff is wonderfully friendly and chipper.... Thank you!

Review: Excited to see another Papa Murphy's open up, this time close to my house - YAY!  Papa Murphy's is take 'n' bake, so don't be surprised when they hand you an uncooked pizza.  It's actually really good.  I can take the pizza home and if my family isn't all in one place, I can toss it in the fridge till we're ready to eat.  After 10-15 minutes in my oven (thin crust they call delite), the pizza is bubbly and has a beautifully brown cracker thin crust.  No joke, this thin crust could go up against the gourmet pizzas you get at those trendy wine bars.  Oh wait, I didn't talk about the toppings yet.  They have fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts - and of course all the usual pizza topping suspects.  Here's what I'm really hooked on...their creamy garlic sauce.  OMG.  You put anything on top of their garlic creamy goodness and it's transformed into something really special.  I really can't say enough, but just try it for yourself.  I used to pick up take 'n' bake pizzas at the grocery/club stores - Papa Murphy's doesn't even belong in the same consideration set.  The two cannot be compared.

Review: We got pizza here for the first time last week.  The staff was very helpful.  We don't order the specialty pizzas, we have our own favorite we like to create.  They did a good job and the pizza was very good.  I ended up getting 2 salads that I really didn't need and threw them away the following day because they the greens were turning brown.  Overall, I spent more money than I planned to BUT, we did get a great pizza and we will go back to place our special pizza order again.

Review: I LOVE Papa Murphy's - it's the best pizza I think I've ever had.  I always order extra cheese and thin crust.  It's the only pizza I ever buy.  Their lasagna is really wonderful, too!  And - my experience has been equally positive in other parts of the country - quality is consistent no matter where I am.  Recently visited my parents in Indianapolis and was so pleased to find out there is a PM's right around the corner from them - they're not big pizza eaters but I insisted we get a pizza and they raved about Papa Murphy's.  On my way to pick up a few pizzas right now!

Review: We just moved from Colorado and I'm unsure if it's just difference in state or if this store just really skimped on everything. In Colorado, the calzones took up over half the trays, and the mini murph (for our son) had dough that came up to the edges and the dough was soft and thicker... his dough also felt thin and dry at the edges.

After cooking, the taste was also just not good at all. Really upset because we love Papa Murphy's calzones and my son loves building his own pizza but will probably try a different location in the future.

Review: The best way to describe this Papa Murphy's franchise is to tell you it is the Chick-fil-A of pizza. Hands-down the most excellent staff and customer service I've ever experienced at a pizza chain. Shane, the manager is awesome. I watched him coach and encourage his team members. Tony & Gabe took my order and created the most beautiful Chicken Bacon Stuffed Crust Pizza. Definitely a work of art. Kind of impressive to look at, too. Did I mention delicious? Yes, it was. Just from the ordering and watching them make my pizza, I knew I would be back. I signed up in store for the loyalty program and have $3 off on my next pizza. Sweet! Give this location a visit. Specials on Tues night. Check the website for the most up to date info. You can order ahead there, too but I encourage you to stop by and order in person. This is my second visit and left me equally impressed with the staff, store and my food. Enjoy

We got a 14" Thin Crust Garden Veggie and it was an absolute delight. The amount of veggies were just right, the sauce was right, the cheese was right and all the ingredients were fresh. 

The baking instructions were perfect and we got a perfect pizza. No more delivery pizza for us from now on!

He looked like he couldn't find it. Asked if it was call I Ordered online. I said I ordered from the app. He looked at me and said in a sarcastic tone"that's online" like I was stupid! I said "Well forg and before I got it out he then said they will be on the rack. There was 1 pizza and I said that's not my order I have 4 pizza's.  He said well I have them in the back cuz "we don't let them sit out" also sarcastic! Then he threw my pizzas on the counter and it's not a flat counter. I said thank you and I will never be back. Yes, I was 1 1/2 hours late. I ordered before they opened and didn't realize my drs appts would run that late. If I hadn't already spent $45 I would have walked out. My first and last time I'll go to another Papa Murphy's! I left VERY UPSET!

Review: This Papa Murphy's location gets it right.  We usually get a pizza every week and they are always exactly what I ordered and they are always on the rack when I walk in the door at my appointed time.  The pizza is yummy and easily on par with takeout joints costing 50% more.  I'd rather cook my own because fully 25% of pizzas I get from takeout places have overcooked the pizza and the crust is nearly burnt on the bottom.

Review: We've been getting pizza at this location for several years, but the service has declined significantly over the last couple of months.  This past weekend we visited the store to order a pizza and I've never had as much trouble placing an order as I did.  It literally took multiple tries to explain what I wanted and it wasn't that complicated.  This after waiting several minutes for someone to stop talking in the back and come out to take my order.  The guy making pizzas never offered a greeting or said some one would be with me in a minute.  Extremely frustrating experience.  The time before the same guy told my husband that you couldn't order a large pizza with thin crust, which we've been ordering for years.  The staff obviously needs more training.

Review: I don't know about you guys, but I am sick and tired of the big box delivery places (papa john's, dominoes). With all the extra fees/charges they try to sneak in on you, a $20 order becomes $40 somehow when you check out. Do they think I'm stupid? Anyway, Papa Murphy's is a great value, the family size pies are huge and priced really well and a 5 minute drive and 10-15 minutes cooking time and you save a ton of money! Just get the oven preheating before you leave to get the pies. With the honey browser extension you can usually knock of a significant discount too! I also echo what everyone else is saying, the customer service at this location is great!

Review: This is the friendliest of all of the local Papa Murphy's in the Plano/Richardson area. Pizza is freshly prepared, with a smile and a side of friendly conversation. Papa Murphy's pizza isn't necessarily going to top your "best of" pizza rankings, but they are tasty and at a good price point.

Review: Today was actually my first time trying Papa Murphy's. My experience went amazingly well. I want to put an emphasis on the service. I've worked in the service industry, and I truly value good customer service. As I walked through the door, I was greeted with a friendly "Welcome to Papa Murphy's," and I was immediately assisted by an employee. The employees were incredibly friendly and made my pizza efficiently and accurately. Regarding the pizza, although I had to bake the pizza at home, it was incredibly easy to follow the baking instructions for the pizza. I ordered the original pan crusted pizza, and after it was baked, the ingredients and especially the pizza dough tasted fresh. I will definitely go back to Papa Murphy's in the future.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: I was a little confused when I picked up my pizza ... COLD. I guess I didn't read into the business enough to know that it sells customized ready-to-bake pizzas. My fault, which is why I'm not giving a low rating

Papa Murphys deserves all 5 stars. This is one of the most delicious pizzas I've had and I somewhat like that I can cook it myself. Sometimes pizza places cook it took long or not long enough. Baking instructions are included and had no issues whatsover during that process. 

Will be back again & will recommend

Review: Having just moved here my wife and I were looking for a place to quickly pick up food after a long night.  We ordered poppa Murphy's pizza and when we picked it up it was late into evening only to find out it's not cooked.  They do advertise it's not but because we've never seen a pizza place sell non cooked pizzas we were definitely surprised.  After cooking pizza we felt pizza was a 3.5 out of 5.  We may order again but not likely.

Review: We ordered online at 5pm so that we could pick up at the online order pick-up register at 5:30pm pick up time that they gave us online. I get there and there is a line going to the front register. So I get in line because no one is at the online order pick up register. Then one of their employees asked me what I'm there for and I said I'm here to pick up an order we ordered online and he asked me the name I gave it and he found two of my pizzas but said that I needed to pay at the front register for my mini murph's and cookie dough. Meanwhile I had stepped out of line 2 talk with him and three other people walked in behind me and got in line so I lost my place in the line to the register. So then after waiting in line again I got up to the front and they are out of mini murphs... so I have to wait for those to be made. After paying I waited and waited and waited. Meanwhile the employees are having a powwow at one end of the pizza making Lane and I am getting more and more irate that the pizzas we ordered at 5 are not even being attended to. Finally I asked them to please finish making my mini Murphy's so I could leave. This place has seen the last dime of my money.

Review: I like the fresh ingredients here, and the prices are great. The staff at this location is friendly & helpful, I just struggle with how greasy their pizza always seems to come out! Not sure what is causing it, because when I make pizzas at home it doesn't happen. I'm wondering if their crust just doesn't absorb some of the oils that other doughs do. Either way, my kiddo likes the little mini-pizzas and they always give her a sticker (which is like proposing to a twenty-something on the scale of excitement), so we'll keep going for her!

Review: I finally tried Papa Murphy's. my friends all like it and I had a coupon. I ordered the garlic chicken specialty pizza and I just didn't like it. They were stingy with the ingredients, the cheese tasted cheap and fake. I had an awful garlic taste in my mouth all night. I felt like I got ripped off even with my coupon and would have been really mad if I had paid full price. Seriously, I have had frozen pizzas that were much better. On the other hand, Sweetie had a pepperoni/sausage special that is always $5 and he was perfectly happy with it. The store was clean and the employees were cheerful. Is it just me?

Review: I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this pizza was!!! I gave it a try because of their Friday's specials and I got a free pizza coupon from one of their texting promotions... I am so glad I tried it!!  This pizza is made by them and baked at home, which is perfect for us because we can have it hot and fresh whenever we want it.  I have been trying to find an affordable yet super yummy pizza so we can have a GOTO takeout pizza place and -- I FOUND IT!!! The pan pizza was awesome & the XLNY pizzas were great too!  I cant wait to try a stuffed pizza.  If you are looking for a great tasting pizza, signup for Papa Murphy's texting deals and give their pizza a try, they have great deals every Tuesday and Friday.  My family REALLY loves it & you can just pop it in the oven anytime you are ready for fresh hot pizza!!!  So easy and so YUMMY!  I used to buy Walmart's fresh pizza and add my own toppings but this pizza BEATS that by far!  Try their creamy garlic sauce, it's Fabulous! You won't believe it until you try it!  Their staff is wonderfully friendly and chipper.... Thank you!

Review: Excited to see another Papa Murphy's open up, this time close to my house - YAY!  Papa Murphy's is take 'n' bake, so don't be surprised when they hand you an uncooked pizza.  It's actually really good.  I can take the pizza home and if my family isn't all in one place, I can toss it in the fridge till we're ready to eat.  After 10-15 minutes in my oven (thin crust they call delite), the pizza is bubbly and has a beautifully brown cracker thin crust.  No joke, this thin crust could go up against the gourmet pizzas you get at those trendy wine bars.  Oh wait, I didn't talk about the toppings yet.  They have fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts - and of course all the usual pizza topping suspects.  Here's what I'm really hooked on...their creamy garlic sauce.  OMG.  You put anything on top of their garlic creamy goodness and it's transformed into something really special.  I really can't say enough, but just try it for yourself.  I used to pick up take 'n' bake pizzas at the grocery/club stores - Papa Murphy's doesn't even belong in the same consideration set.  The two cannot be compared.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: We got pizza here for the first time last week.  The staff was very helpful.  We don't order the specialty pizzas, we have our own favorite we like to create.  They did a good job and the pizza was very good.  I ended up getting 2 salads that I really didn't need and threw them away the following day because they the greens were turning brown.  Overall, I spent more money than I planned to BUT, we did get a great pizza and we will go back to place our special pizza order again.

Review: I LOVE Papa Murphy's - it's the best pizza I think I've ever had.  I always order extra cheese and thin crust.  It's the only pizza I ever buy.  Their lasagna is really wonderful, too!  And - my experience has been equally positive in other parts of the country - quality is consistent no matter where I am.  Recently visited my parents in Indianapolis and was so pleased to find out there is a PM's right around the corner from them - they're not big pizza eaters but I insisted we get a pizza and they raved about Papa Murphy's.  On my way to pick up a few pizzas right now!

Review: We just moved from Colorado and I'm unsure if it's just difference in state or if this store just really skimped on everything. In Colorado, the calzones took up over half the trays, and the mini murph (for our son) had dough that came up to the edges and the dough was soft and thicker... his dough also felt thin and dry at the edges.

After cooking, the taste was also just not good at all. Really upset because we love Papa Murphy's calzones and my son loves building his own pizza but will probably try a different location in the future.

Review: Awful customer service. Was told I can't buy a gluten free crust with just olive oil so I can make my wife her own pizza with organic ingredients.  I will never buy anything from this place ever again

Review: The best way to describe this Papa Murphy's franchise is to tell you it is the Chick-fil-A of pizza. Hands-down the most excellent staff and customer service I've ever experienced at a pizza chain. Shane, the manager is awesome. I watched him coach and encourage his team members. Tony & Gabe took my order and created the most beautiful Chicken Bacon Stuffed Crust Pizza. Definitely a work of art. Kind of impressive to look at, too. Did I mention delicious? Yes, it was. Just from the ordering and watching them make my pizza, I knew I would be back. I signed up in store for the loyalty program and have $3 off on my next pizza. Sweet! Give this location a visit. Specials on Tues night. Check the website for the most up to date info. You can order ahead there, too but I encourage you to stop by and order in person. This is my second visit and left me equally impressed with the staff, store and my food. Enjoy

Review: We have been living in this neighborhood for over 2 years and hadn't got a pizza from this place and this is just 2 minute drive. I am wondering WHY?

We got a 14" Thin Crust Garden Veggie and it was an absolute delight. The amount of veggies were just right, the sauce was right, the cheese was right and all the ingredients were fresh. 

The baking instructions were perfect and we got a perfect pizza. No more delivery pizza for us from now on!

Review: I love Papa Murphys so I was incredibly excited to find out there was one just down the street from our new house. I placed my order online and my husband went to pick it up. He said he walked in, told them his name, was handed the pizza's and was on his way. Completely painless. I really like that they have an online ordering option. Sometimes I don't trust people taking my order over the phone so it's nice to do it online and see in print what you ordered confirmed. 

The pizzas turned out great. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza with jalapeños on a gluten free crust. I love their gluten free crust! It's a thin crust that cooks perfectly crispy. It has a great flavor to it! 

We will definitely be returning to this location for our pizza nights!
