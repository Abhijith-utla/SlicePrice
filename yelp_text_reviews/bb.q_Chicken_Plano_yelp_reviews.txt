This barbecue chicken is always consistent. My wife and I love it, and we always take people to this location. Make sure you try the Caribbean flavor.

We decided to have a fun weekday dinner and settled on Korean fried chicken since we were in the area.
This spot is part of a well-known chain, so l already had high expectations for the quality-and they didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is a nice size, not too big or small, with TVs on the walls playing K-pop music videos, which added to the vibe. They also have booth seating in the back, which is great for small groups looking to enjoy chicken wings with some drinks.
We ordered the secret sauce wings and the spicy original wings. Both came out hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.
Korean fried chicken truly is the best-crispy, perfectly seasoned, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy.
They were even better piping hot! Each order also comes with pickled radish on the side, which is a nice touch.
Overall, this place is a fantastic choice for fried chicken. We'll definitely be coming back--again and again!

5 stars
What a nice little joint.  I've never had chicken wings like this ever before, or at least since Hooters was still good and could deliver crunchy fried and sauced wings that maintained the crunch.  Well, these folks make disgustingly good wings.  I don't know what sort of mega-chicken produce these drums and flats but even at 13$ for 9 wings, I couldn't stop but to finish them off in one sitting.  Hot, fresh, spicy (I got the hottest ones), nice cold Soju and other Korean fare.  You pop in and the cat behind the counter seats you swiftly, is responsive and while it takes a little bit to get your food, that just means it was done fresh and to order.  Novelty after you finish paying you get a token for the crane drop machine in the entry way (I got a lollipop heh).  Highly recommend.  Places like this in the N. Plano area are so plenty it makes me happy to go into the office, I look forward to lunch.  I'll be back here again.

YUM!

The chicken has the perfect crunch and moisture and serving size is massive. I love going here to eat. The staff are always friendly and definitely deserve a good tip. The restaurant is nice and clean and very cool. My favorite flavors are the cheesling, soy garlic, honey garlic, and gangjeong. I definitely recommend trying them!

5 stars
The place is quietly tucked away in the strip center so it was not busy when we there. We went based on a coworker's recommendation and this place did not disappoint us. 
The chicken is well cooked, crispy and flavorful. The person working was attentive and willing to help us when couldn't decide which flavors to get for our group. He even let us try some of the sauces before committing to the flavor. We had more than enough of chicken for our party of 4 and my personal favorite was the So Ddeok So Ddeok.

5 stars
Honey garlic chicken was fantastic! First time here but will definitely return. Ordered in person and food was ready in 15 mins. Staff was friendly and made sure we got our order once ready.

5 stars
Omg best wings!!! The Honey Garlic is my jam and their sweet potato fries ! The interior is very K-pop and the service is quick and efficient. Def give them a shot...you won't regret it

Love This crispy chicken and the selection of sauce. The hot is really spicy, and the garlic or soy is great.

4 stars
You can't go wrong with crispy fried chicken, flavorful sauces, and the freshness of the pickled radish. We ordered the Gangman, spicy Galbi, and a third that I can't remember. We devoured all the wings and left satisfied. Service was good, staff were friendly.

5 stars
Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.
I give:
Staff 5 stars - so friendly and helpful.
Food 5 stars - very tasty, great temp, good portion.
Dining room cleanliness 5 stars - clean tables, clean floor.
Men's restroom 2 stars - I had to wash the sauce off of my hands and face, and would have liked the men's room to be cleaner.
Price 3 stars - $15 for 9 wings = $1.67 per wing. (WingStop $11.99 for 10 = $1.20 per wing, Buffalo Wild Wings $14.99 for 10 = $1.50, Chilis $15.59 for 8 = $1.95 per wing).

5 stars
This location is great and the chicken is always crispy and tasty. My fave is the Caribbean spice wings. It seems like the various locations have different version of the corn salad, but out of the 3 different locations I've had I rate this location's in the middle. It would be great if the delivery bags were sealed better, however.

Food is always fresh and chicken is so flavorful and crispy. Customer service as great.

Delicious chicken. The wings had a perfect crunch and cooked with pride. Service was excellent and the restaurant had a great vibe.

Korean fried chicken for the win! This was my last stop while visiting Frisco. Inside was nice and the wall display education on the chicken frying process was a good touch. 

Now I ordered the Honey Garlic wings w waffle fries. They came out smoking hot along with the crispy waffle fries. The sauce was great and the crunch was worth the trip. Now I couldn't finish my order so I took the rest with me and finished in the airport. Now at least 2hours had passed and even covered in sauce the Crunch was still there. I enjoyed these wings definitely a good choice

This place is so yummy!! That I had to try the tax's version.  We got a bunch of spicy food that I forgot to take a picture and ate it all!!

10/10 recommend this place for the best fried chicken!

5 stars
Great food and amazing service!
I definitely would recommend this place.   Large orders so go hungry.

5 stars
I love the Gingham style wings. I really wish they had a location closer in the Mesquite area. We're always satisfied with the food and service. I don't think it's a bad flavor on the menu.

2 stars
I really hate to do a negative review on a place where the food is soooo good. 

A little history. I've had their food, many many times, but call and order for pickup BUT today is the first time I have come in and ordered due to circumstances.

Place i

But man, customer service was not great. I'm taking the food to go. (To the hospital at that... who wants to have bad service when dealing with a situation like that)
Anywho, I asked since so many of the family is rotation out of the waiting room, if I can buy some large orders and either have him split it up in two boxes, or give me a couple extra boxes. He said no.
So I was explaining our situation. He said no again. So...
I said is it for the cost of the boxes? And he said probably. So I offered to buy a box and he said... you guessed it.... No.

So o could have ordered a lot of smaller orders, but because I ordered larges, I can't get an extra smaller box...

On another note... talking shit in Korean behind a customer's back may be ok for you, but I'm a Korean-American, and may not look it, but I understood every last insult. The ugly things the cashier say make me never want to come back.  

So if you want good food, they have it. 4.5 star worthy. If you want good service and honorable respect, go elsewhere.

2 stars
Food is great ans service is acceptable. However, we had a party of 7 and it was completely acceptable to charge the 18%  

What was not right was that after eating, 2 of us order  togo to take home to our family separately from our party, on a separate check. They charged us 18% on those take out orders. This was not very honest of them at all. I paid it with no argument but do not think we did not notice! That's very dishonest of your people. May 18. The party bill was 171.16. One of the take out orders was 56.20. Just to show you that this is a legit review/complaint

4 stars
I've never been to this BBQ chicken location but I thought that the decor looked better than most. Came here on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat without waiting. Overall had a good experience and the quality was on par with this chain. 

My wife and I got the secret spicy and hot spicy boneless chicken and both were fried well and had a good flavor. I'll come back if I'm in the area!

5 stars
Delicious chicken!  The marinating process is what makes the difference!  Honey garlic boneless was delicious.  Really enjoyed the corn salad.  Interior finish was very cozy yet modern.  Fun vibe!  Wait staff very friendly!

4 stars
I wanted Korean fried chicken so we came here during lunch time on a Saturday after shopping.  I am still trying to find a Korean fried chicken that is better or the same as 99 Chicken back in Santa Clara.  Inside is nice and it looks bigger on the inside than on the outside.  If you do the yelp check in and ask for a free soda, they do not honor it anymore.

They have many different selections of chicken, we ordered the soy garlic and the honey garlic.  The chicken itself was great, but some of the pieces was a little dry.

Services was great.

1 stars
Ordered two large orders of wings, nearly 40 wings. Asked for extra rance and paid for it. Received one small tube of ranch. When i called, the extra ranch was the small tube. Lol... ok...wings were soggy. Won't be back!.

5 stars
Best fried chicken wings ever. Even though the wings are coated in sauce, the wings are super crunchy and have a great texture!

4 stars
If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!  

After a 20 minute wait and a quick jaunt to 99 Ranch, my wings came out beautifully boxed and ready to go.  

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!  

Now there are a lot of flavors.. we tried sweet and spicy and also honey garlic, BOTH of which we would get again as they were the finger licking good type of sauces.  

I'd be interested in trying Galbi flavor?!  I've not seen this as a flavor before for chicken... 

Be sure to checkout their sides as well to go with your chicken!  We got cheese sticks (our litmus test) but wished we had gotten some fries.

4 stars
As for the food, the whole chicken we got was very crispy and flavorful and was gone in just moments lol 

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

5 stars
Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

5 stars
The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

3 stars
the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

4 stars
It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

5 stars
Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

Very rude woman who cannot communicate in English and gave me an attitude just because I cannot understand her. Extremely rude people. Will not give business to terrible people - this business

I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

4 stars
Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

3 stars
I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

4 stars
We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

5 stars
By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

2 stars
Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

5 stars
Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

3 stars
I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

5 stars
Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

We have this once a week, it's so good. Faves are the honey garlic and soy garlic boneless wings.

Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.
I give:
Staff 5 stars - so friendly and helpful.
Food 5 stars - very tasty, great temp, good portion.
Dining room cleanliness 5 stars - clean tables, clean floor.
Men's restroom 2 stars - I had to wash the sauce off of my hands and face, and would have liked the men's room to be cleaner.
Price 3 stars - $15 for 9 wings = $1.67 per wing. (WingStop $11.99 for 10 = $1.20 per wing, Buffalo Wild Wings $14.99 for 10 = $1.50, Chilis $15.59 for 8 = $1.95 per wing).

This location is great and the chicken is always crispy and tasty. My fave is the Caribbean spice wings. It seems like the various locations have different version of the corn salad, but out of the 3 different locations I've had I rate this location's in the middle. It would be great if the delivery bags were sealed better, however.

Food is always fresh and chicken is so flavorful and crispy. Customer service as great.

Korean fried chicken for the win! This was my last stop while visiting Frisco. Inside was nice and the wall display education on the chicken frying process was a good touch. 

Now I ordered the Honey Garlic wings w waffle fries. They came out smoking hot along with the crispy waffle fries. The sauce was great and the crunch was worth the trip. Now I couldn't finish my order so I took the rest with me and finished in the airport. Now at least 2hours had passed and even covered in sauce the Crunch was still there. I enjoyed these wings definitely a good choice

This place is so yummy!! That I had to try the tax's version.  We got a bunch of spicy food that I forgot to take a picture and ate it all!!

10/10 recommend this place for the best fried chicken!

5 stars
Great food and amazing service!
I definitely would recommend this place.   Large orders so go hungry.

I love the Gingham style wings. I really wish they had a location closer in the Mesquite area. We're always satisfied with the food and service. I don't think it's a bad flavor on the menu.

2 stars
I really hate to do a negative review on a place where the food is soooo good. 

A little history. I've had their food, many many times, but call and order for pickup BUT today is the first time I have come in and ordered due to circumstances.

Place i

But man, customer service was not great. I'm taking the food to go. (To the hospital at that... who wants to have bad service when dealing with a situation like that)
Anywho, I asked since so many of the family is rotation out of the waiting room, if I can buy some large orders and either have him split it up in two boxes, or give me a couple extra boxes. He said no.
So I was explaining our situation. He said no again. So...
I said is it for the cost of the boxes? And he said probably. So I offered to buy a box and he said... you guessed it.... No.

So o could have ordered a lot of smaller orders, but because I ordered larges, I can't get an extra smaller box...

On another note... talking shit in Korean behind a customer's back may be ok for you, but I'm a Korean-American, and may not look it, but I understood every last insult. The ugly things the cashier say make me never want to come back.  

So if you want good food, they have it. 4.5 star worthy. If you want good service and honorable respect, go elsewhere.

2 stars
Food is great ans service is acceptable. However, we had a party of 7 and it was completely acceptable to charge the 18%  

What was not right was that after eating, 2 of us order  togo to take home to our family separately from our party, on a separate check. They charged us 18% on those take out orders. This was not very honest of them at all. I paid it with no argument but do not think we did not notice! That's very dishonest of your people. May 18. The party bill was 171.16. One of the take out orders was 56.20. Just to show you that this is a legit review/complaint

4 stars
I've never been to this BBQ chicken location but I thought that the decor looked better than most. Came here on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat without waiting. Overall had a good experience and the quality was on par with this chain. 

My wife and I got the secret spicy and hot spicy boneless chicken and both were fried well and had a good flavor. I'll come back if I'm in the area!

5 stars
Delicious chicken!  The marinating process is what makes the difference!  Honey garlic boneless was delicious.  Really enjoyed the corn salad.  Interior finish was very cozy yet modern.  Fun vibe!  Wait staff very friendly!

I wanted Korean fried chicken so we came here during lunch time on a Saturday after shopping.  I am still trying to find a Korean fried chicken that is better or the same as 99 Chicken back in Santa Clara.  Inside is nice and it looks bigger on the inside than on the outside.  If you do the yelp check in and ask for a free soda, they do not honor it anymore.

They have many different selections of chicken, we ordered the soy garlic and the honey garlic.  The chicken itself was great, but some of the pieces was a little dry.

Services was great.

1 stars
Ordered two large orders of wings, nearly 40 wings. Asked for extra rance and paid for it. Received one small tube of ranch. When i called, the extra ranch was the small tube. Lol... ok...wings were soggy. Won't be back!.

5 stars
Best fried chicken wings ever. Even though the wings are coated in sauce, the wings are super crunchy and have a great texture!

4 stars
If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!  

After a 20 minute wait and a quick jaunt to 99 Ranch, my wings came out beautifully boxed and ready to go.  

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!  

Now there are a lot of flavors.. we tried sweet and spicy and also honey garlic, BOTH of which we would get again as they were the finger licking good type of sauces.  

I'd be interested in trying Galbi flavor?!  I've not seen this as a flavor before for chicken... 

Be sure to checkout their sides as well to go with your chicken!  We got cheese sticks (our litmus test) but wished we had gotten some fries.

4 stars
As for the food, the whole chicken we got was very crispy and flavorful and was gone in just moments lol 

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

5 stars
Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

5 stars
The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

3 stars
the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

4 stars
It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

5 stars
Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

3 stars
My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

1 stars
Very rude woman who cannot communicate in English and gave me an attitude just because I cannot understand her. Extremely rude people. Will not give business to terrible people - this business

I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

Food was decent, I got the little octopus balls and they tasted pretty got old quick.

Also had the corn salad, recommend. Good $2 purchase.

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

4 stars
Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

3 stars
I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

4 stars
We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

5 stars
By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

2 stars
Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

5 stars
Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

3 stars
I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

5 stars
Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

5 stars
We have this once a week, it's so good. Faves are the honey garlic and soy garlic boneless wings.

We decided to have a fun weekday dinner and settled on Korean fried chicken since we were in the area.
This spot is part of a well-known chain, so l already had high expectations for the quality-and they didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is a nice size, not too big or small, with TVs on the walls playing K-pop music videos, which added to the vibe. They also have booth seating in the back, which is great for small groups looking to enjoy chicken wings with some drinks.
We ordered the secret sauce wings and the spicy original wings. Both came out hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.
Korean fried chicken truly is the best-crispy, perfectly seasoned, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy.
They were even better piping hot! Each order also comes with pickled radish on the side, which is a nice touch.
Overall, this place is a fantastic choice for fried chicken. We'll definitely be coming back--again and again!

5 stars
What a nice little joint.  I've never had chicken wings like this ever before, or at least since Hooters was still good and could deliver crunchy fried and sauced wings that maintained the crunch.  Well, these folks make disgustingly good wings.  I don't know what sort of mega-chicken produce these drums and flats but even at 13$ for 9 wings, I couldn't stop but to finish them off in one sitting.  Hot, fresh, spicy (I got the hottest ones), nice cold Soju and other Korean fare.  You pop in and the cat behind the counter seats you swiftly, is responsive and while it takes a little bit to get your food, that just means it was done fresh and to order.  Novelty after you finish paying you get a token for the crane drop machine in the entry way (I got a lollipop heh).  Highly recommend.  Places like this in the N. Plano area are so plenty it makes me happy to go into the office, I look forward to lunch.  I'll be back here again.

YUM!

5 stars
The chicken has the perfect crunch and moisture and serving size is massive. I love going here to eat. The staff are always friendly and definitely deserve a good tip. The restaurant is nice and clean and very cool. My favorite flavors are the cheesling, soy garlic, honey garlic, and gangjeong. I definitely recommend trying them!

5 stars
The place is quietly tucked away in the strip center so it was not busy when we there. We went based on a coworker's recommendation and this place did not disappoint us. 
The chicken is well cooked, crispy and flavorful. The person working was attentive and willing to help us when couldn't decide which flavors to get for our group. He even let us try some of the sauces before committing to the flavor. We had more than enough of chicken for our party of 4 and my personal favorite was the So Ddeok So Ddeok.

5 stars
Honey garlic chicken was fantastic! First time here but will definitely return. Ordered in person and food was ready in 15 mins. Staff was friendly and made sure we got our order once ready.

You can't go wrong with crispy fried chicken, flavorful sauces, and the freshness of the pickled radish. We ordered the Gangman, spicy Galbi, and a third that I can't remember. We devoured all the wings and left satisfied. Service was good, staff were friendly.

Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.

I really hate to do a negative review on a place where the food is soooo good. 

A little history. I've had their food, many many times, but call and order for pickup BUT today is the first time I have come in and ordered due to circumstances.

Place i

But man, customer service was not great. I'm taking the food to go. (To the hospital at that... who wants to have bad service when dealing with a situation like that)
Anywho, I asked since so many of the family is rotation out of the waiting room, if I can buy some large orders and either have him split it up in two boxes, or give me a couple extra boxes. He said no.
So I was explaining our situation. He said no again. So...
I said is it for the cost of the boxes? And he said probably. So I offered to buy a box and he said... you guessed it.... No.

So o could have ordered a lot of smaller orders, but because I ordered larges, I can't get an extra smaller box...

On another note... talking shit in Korean behind a customer's back may be ok for you, but I'm a Korean-American, and may not look it, but I understood every last insult. The ugly things the cashier say make me never want to come back.  

So if you want good food, they have it. 4.5 star worthy. If you want good service and honorable respect, go elsewhere.

Food is great ans service is acceptable. However, we had a party of 7 and it was completely acceptable to charge the 18%  

What was not right was that after eating, 2 of us order  togo to take home to our family separately from our party, on a separate check. They charged us 18% on those take out orders. This was not very honest of them at all. I paid it with no argument but do not think we did not notice! That's very dishonest of your people. May 18. The party bill was 171.16. One of the take out orders was 56.20. Just to show you that this is a legit review/complaint

I've never been to this BBQ chicken location but I thought that the decor looked better than most. Came here on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat without waiting. Overall had a good experience and the quality was on par with this chain. 

My wife and I got the secret spicy and hot spicy boneless chicken and both were fried well and had a good flavor. I'll come back if I'm in the area!

Delicious chicken!  The marinating process is what makes the difference!  Honey garlic boneless was delicious.  Really enjoyed the corn salad.  Interior finish was very cozy yet modern.  Fun vibe!  Wait staff very friendly!

I wanted Korean fried chicken so we came here during lunch time on a Saturday after shopping.  I am still trying to find a Korean fried chicken that is better or the same as 99 Chicken back in Santa Clara.  Inside is nice and it looks bigger on the inside than on the outside.  If you do the yelp check in and ask for a free soda, they do not honor it anymore.

They have many different selections of chicken, we ordered the soy garlic and the honey garlic.  The chicken itself was great, but some of the pieces was a little dry.

Services was great.

Ordered two large orders of wings, nearly 40 wings. Asked for extra rance and paid for it. Received one small tube of ranch. When i called, the extra ranch was the small tube. Lol... ok...wings were soggy. Won't be back!.

5 stars
Best fried chicken wings ever. Even though the wings are coated in sauce, the wings are super crunchy and have a great texture!

4 stars
If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!  

After a 20 minute wait and a quick jaunt to 99 Ranch, my wings came out beautifully boxed and ready to go.  

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!  

Now there are a lot of flavors.. we tried sweet and spicy and also honey garlic, BOTH of which we would get again as they were the finger licking good type of sauces.  

I'd be interested in trying Galbi flavor?!  I've not seen this as a flavor before for chicken... 

Be sure to checkout their sides as well to go with your chicken!  We got cheese sticks (our litmus test) but wished we had gotten some fries.

4 stars
As for the food, the whole chicken we got was very crispy and flavorful and was gone in just moments lol 

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

5 stars
Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

5 stars
The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

3 stars
the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

4 stars
It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

5 stars
Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

Very rude woman who cannot communicate in English and gave me an attitude just because I cannot understand her. Extremely rude people. Will not give business to terrible people - this business

I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

4 stars
Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

3 stars
I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

4 stars
Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

4 stars
We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

5 stars
By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

2 stars
Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

5 stars
Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

3 stars
I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

5 stars
Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

5 stars
We have this once a week, it's so good. Faves are the honey garlic and soy garlic boneless wings.

We decided to have a fun weekday dinner and settled on Korean fried chicken since we were in the area.
This spot is part of a well-known chain, so l already had high expectations for the quality-and they didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is a nice size, not too big or small, with TVs on the walls playing K-pop music videos, which added to the vibe. They also have booth seating in the back, which is great for small groups looking to enjoy chicken wings with some drinks.
We ordered the secret sauce wings and the spicy original wings. Both came out hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.
Korean fried chicken truly is the best-crispy, perfectly seasoned, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy.
They were even better piping hot! Each order also comes with pickled radish on the side, which is a nice touch.
Overall, this place is a fantastic choice for fried chicken. We'll definitely be coming back--again and again!

5 stars
What a nice little joint.  I've never had chicken wings like this ever before, or at least since Hooters was still good and could deliver crunchy fried and sauced wings that maintained the crunch.  Well, these folks make disgustingly good wings.  I don't know what sort of mega-chicken produce these drums and flats but even at 13$ for 9 wings, I couldn't stop but to finish them off in one sitting.  Hot, fresh, spicy (I got the hottest ones), nice cold Soju and other Korean fare.  You pop in and the cat behind the counter seats you swiftly, is responsive and while it takes a little bit to get your food, that just means it was done fresh and to order.  Novelty after you finish paying you get a token for the crane drop machine in the entry way (I got a lollipop heh).  Highly recommend.  Places like this in the N. Plano area are so plenty it makes me happy to go into the office, I look forward to lunch.  I'll be back here again.

YUM!

5 stars
The chicken has the perfect crunch and moisture and serving size is massive. I love going here to eat. The staff are always friendly and definitely deserve a good tip. The restaurant is nice and clean and very cool. My favorite flavors are the cheesling, soy garlic, honey garlic, and gangjeong. I definitely recommend trying them!

5 stars
The place is quietly tucked away in the strip center so it was not busy when we there. We went based on a coworker's recommendation and this place did not disappoint us. 
The chicken is well cooked, crispy and flavorful. The person working was attentive and willing to help us when couldn't decide which flavors to get for our group. He even let us try some of the sauces before committing to the flavor. We had more than enough of chicken for our party of 4 and my personal favorite was the So Ddeok So Ddeok.

5 stars
Honey garlic chicken was fantastic! First time here but will definitely return. Ordered in person and food was ready in 15 mins. Staff was friendly and made sure we got our order once ready.

You can't go wrong with crispy fried chicken, flavorful sauces, and the freshness of the pickled radish. We ordered the Gangman, spicy Galbi, and a third that I can't remember. We devoured all the wings and left satisfied. Service was good, staff were friendly.

Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.
I give:
Staff 5 stars - so friendly and helpful.
Food 5 stars - very tasty, great temp, good portion.
Dining room cleanliness 5 stars - clean tables, clean floor.
Men's restroom 2 stars - I had to wash the sauce off of my hands and face, and would have liked the men's room to be cleaner.
Price 3 stars - $15 for 9 wings = $1.67 per wing. (WingStop $11.99 for 10 = $1.20 per wing, Buffalo Wild Wings $14.99 for 10 = $1.50, Chilis $15.59 for 8 = $1.95 per wing).

5 stars
This location is great and the chicken is always crispy and tasty. My fave is the Caribbean spice wings. It seems like the various locations have different version of the corn salad, but out of the 3 different locations I've had I rate this location's in the middle. It would be great if the delivery bags were sealed better, however.

Korean fried chicken for the win! This was my last stop while visiting Frisco. Inside was nice and the wall display education on the chicken frying process was a good touch. 

Now I ordered the Honey Garlic wings w waffle fries. They came out smoking hot along with the crispy waffle fries. The sauce was great and the crunch was worth the trip. Now I couldn't finish my order so I took the rest with me and finished in the airport. Now at least 2hours had passed and even covered in sauce the Crunch was still there. I enjoyed these wings definitely a good choice

The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

4 stars
We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

5 stars
By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

2 stars
Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

5 stars
Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

3 stars
I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

5 stars
Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

We have this once a week, it's so good. Faves are the honey garlic and soy garlic boneless wings.

We decided to have a fun weekday dinner and settled on Korean fried chicken since we were in the area.
This spot is part of a well-known chain, so l already had high expectations for the quality-and they didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is a nice size, not too big or small, with TVs on the walls playing K-pop music videos, which added to the vibe. They also have booth seating in the back, which is great for small groups looking to enjoy chicken wings with some drinks.
We ordered the secret sauce wings and the spicy original wings. Both came out hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.
Korean fried chicken truly is the best-crispy, perfectly seasoned, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy.
They were even better piping hot! Each order also comes with pickled radish on the side, which is a nice touch.
Overall, this place is a fantastic choice for fried chicken. We'll definitely be coming back--again and again!

5 stars
What a nice little joint.  I've never had chicken wings like this ever before, or at least since Hooters was still good and could deliver crunchy fried and sauced wings that maintained the crunch.  Well, these folks make disgustingly good wings.  I don't know what sort of mega-chicken produce these drums and flats but even at 13$ for 9 wings, I couldn't stop but to finish them off in one sitting.  Hot, fresh, spicy (I got the hottest ones), nice cold Soju and other Korean fare.  You pop in and the cat behind the counter seats you swiftly, is responsive and while it takes a little bit to get your food, that just means it was done fresh and to order.  Novelty after you finish paying you get a token for the crane drop machine in the entry way (I got a lollipop heh).  Highly recommend.  Places like this in the N. Plano area are so plenty it makes me happy to go into the office, I look forward to lunch.  I'll be back here again.

YUM!

The chicken has the perfect crunch and moisture and serving size is massive. I love going here to eat. The staff are always friendly and definitely deserve a good tip. The restaurant is nice and clean and very cool. My favorite flavors are the cheesling, soy garlic, honey garlic, and gangjeong. I definitely recommend trying them!

5 stars
The place is quietly tucked away in the strip center so it was not busy when we there. We went based on a coworker's recommendation and this place did not disappoint us. 
The chicken is well cooked, crispy and flavorful. The person working was attentive and willing to help us when couldn't decide which flavors to get for our group. He even let us try some of the sauces before committing to the flavor. We had more than enough of chicken for our party of 4 and my personal favorite was the So Ddeok So Ddeok.

Honey garlic chicken was fantastic! First time here but will definitely return. Ordered in person and food was ready in 15 mins. Staff was friendly and made sure we got our order once ready.

You can't go wrong with crispy fried chicken, flavorful sauces, and the freshness of the pickled radish. We ordered the Gangman, spicy Galbi, and a third that I can't remember. We devoured all the wings and left satisfied. Service was good, staff were friendly.

Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.
I give:
Staff 5 stars - so friendly and helpful.
Food 5 stars - very tasty, great temp, good portion.
Dining room cleanliness 5 stars - clean tables, clean floor.
Men's restroom 2 stars - I had to wash the sauce off of my hands and face, and would have liked the men's room to be cleaner.
Price 3 stars - $15 for 9 wings = $1.67 per wing. (WingStop $11.99 for 10 = $1.20 per wing, Buffalo Wild Wings $14.99 for 10 = $1.50, Chilis $15.59 for 8 = $1.95 per wing).

5 stars
This location is great and the chicken is always crispy and tasty. My fave is the Caribbean spice wings. It seems like the various locations have different version of the corn salad, but out of the 3 different locations I've had I rate this location's in the middle. It would be great if the delivery bags were sealed better, however.

Korean fried chicken for the win! This was my last stop while visiting Frisco. Inside was nice and the wall display education on the chicken frying process was a good touch. 

Now I ordered the Honey Garlic wings w waffle fries. They came out smoking hot along with the crispy waffle fries. The sauce was great and the crunch was worth the trip. Now I couldn't finish my order so I took the rest with me and finished in the airport. Now at least 2hours had passed and even covered in sauce the Crunch was still there. I enjoyed these wings definitely a good choice

I really hate to do a negative review on a place where the food is soooo good. 

A little history. I've had their food, many many times, but call and order for pickup BUT today is the first time I have come in and ordered due to circumstances.

Place i

But man, customer service was not great. I'm taking the food to go. (To the hospital at that... who wants to have bad service when dealing with a situation like that)
Anywho, I asked since so many of the family is rotation out of the waiting room, if I can buy some large orders and either have him split it up in two boxes, or give me a couple extra boxes. He said no.
So I was explaining our situation. He said no again. So...
I said is it for the cost of the boxes? And he said probably. So I offered to buy a box and he said... you guessed it.... No.

So o could have ordered a lot of smaller orders, but because I ordered larges, I can't get an extra smaller box...

On another note... talking shit in Korean behind a customer's back may be ok for you, but I'm a Korean-American, and may not look it, but I understood every last insult. The ugly things the cashier say make me never want to come back.  

So if you want good food, they have it. 4.5 star worthy. If you want good service and honorable respect, go elsewhere.

2 stars
Food is great ans service is acceptable. However, we had a party of 7 and it was completely acceptable to charge the 18%  

What was not right was that after eating, 2 of us order  togo to take home to our family separately from our party, on a separate check. They charged us 18% on those take out orders. This was not very honest of them at all. I paid it with no argument but do not think we did not notice! That's very dishonest of your people. May 18. The party bill was 171.16. One of the take out orders was 56.20. Just to show you that this is a legit review/complaint

I've never been to this BBQ chicken location but I thought that the decor looked better than most. Came here on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat without waiting. Overall had a good experience and the quality was on par with this chain. 

My wife and I got the secret spicy and hot spicy boneless chicken and both were fried well and had a good flavor. I'll come back if I'm in the area!

I wanted Korean fried chicken so we came here during lunch time on a Saturday after shopping.  I am still trying to find a Korean fried chicken that is better or the same as 99 Chicken back in Santa Clara.  Inside is nice and it looks bigger on the inside than on the outside.  If you do the yelp check in and ask for a free soda, they do not honor it anymore.

They have many different selections of chicken, we ordered the soy garlic and the honey garlic.  The chicken itself was great, but some of the pieces was a little dry.

Services was great.

Ordered two large orders of wings, nearly 40 wings. Asked for extra rance and paid for it. Received one small tube of ranch. When i called, the extra ranch was the small tube. Lol... ok...wings were soggy. Won't be back!.

5 stars
Best fried chicken wings ever. Even though the wings are coated in sauce, the wings are super crunchy and have a great texture!

4 stars
If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!  

After a 20 minute wait and a quick jaunt to 99 Ranch, my wings came out beautifully boxed and ready to go.  

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!  

Now there are a lot of flavors.. we tried sweet and spicy and also honey garlic, BOTH of which we would get again as they were the finger licking good type of sauces.  

I'd be interested in trying Galbi flavor?!  I've not seen this as a flavor before for chicken... 

Be sure to checkout their sides as well to go with your chicken!  We got cheese sticks (our litmus test) but wished we had gotten some fries.

4 stars
As for the food, the whole chicken we got was very crispy and flavorful and was gone in just moments lol 

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

5 stars
Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

4 stars
We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

5 stars
By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

2 stars
Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

5 stars
Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

3 stars
I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

5 stars
Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

5 stars
We have this once a week, it's so good. Faves are the honey garlic and soy garlic boneless wings.

We decided to have a fun weekday dinner and settled on Korean fried chicken since we were in the area.
This spot is part of a well-known chain, so l already had high expectations for the quality-and they didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is a nice size, not too big or small, with TVs on the walls playing K-pop music videos, which added to the vibe. They also have booth seating in the back, which is great for small groups looking to enjoy chicken wings with some drinks.
We ordered the secret sauce wings and the spicy original wings. Both came out hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.
Korean fried chicken truly is the best-crispy, perfectly seasoned, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy.
They were even better piping hot! Each order also comes with pickled radish on the side, which is a nice touch.
Overall, this place is a fantastic choice for fried chicken. We'll definitely be coming back--again and again!

5 stars
What a nice little joint.  I've never had chicken wings like this ever before, or at least since Hooters was still good and could deliver crunchy fried and sauced wings that maintained the crunch.  Well, these folks make disgustingly good wings.  I don't know what sort of mega-chicken produce these drums and flats but even at 13$ for 9 wings, I couldn't stop but to finish them off in one sitting.  Hot, fresh, spicy (I got the hottest ones), nice cold Soju and other Korean fare.  You pop in and the cat behind the counter seats you swiftly, is responsive and while it takes a little bit to get your food, that just means it was done fresh and to order.  Novelty after you finish paying you get a token for the crane drop machine in the entry way (I got a lollipop heh).  Highly recommend.  Places like this in the N. Plano area are so plenty it makes me happy to go into the office, I look forward to lunch.  I'll be back here again.

YUM!

5 stars
The chicken has the perfect crunch and moisture and serving size is massive. I love going here to eat. The staff are always friendly and definitely deserve a good tip. The restaurant is nice and clean and very cool. My favorite flavors are the cheesling, soy garlic, honey garlic, and gangjeong. I definitely recommend trying them!

5 stars
The place is quietly tucked away in the strip center so it was not busy when we there. We went based on a coworker's recommendation and this place did not disappoint us. 
The chicken is well cooked, crispy and flavorful. The person working was attentive and willing to help us when couldn't decide which flavors to get for our group. He even let us try some of the sauces before committing to the flavor. We had more than enough of chicken for our party of 4 and my personal favorite was the So Ddeok So Ddeok.

5 stars
Honey garlic chicken was fantastic! First time here but will definitely return. Ordered in person and food was ready in 15 mins. Staff was friendly and made sure we got our order once ready.

5 stars
Omg best wings!!! The Honey Garlic is my jam and their sweet potato fries ! The interior is very K-pop and the service is quick and efficient. Def give them a shot...you won't regret it

Love This crispy chicken and the selection of sauce. The hot is really spicy, and the garlic or soy is great.

You can't go wrong with crispy fried chicken, flavorful sauces, and the freshness of the pickled radish. We ordered the Gangman, spicy Galbi, and a third that I can't remember. We devoured all the wings and left satisfied. Service was good, staff were friendly.

Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.
I give:
Staff 5 stars - so friendly and helpful.
Food 5 stars - very tasty, great temp, good portion.
Dining room cleanliness 5 stars - clean tables, clean floor.
Men's restroom 2 stars - I had to wash the sauce off of my hands and face, and would have liked the men's room to be cleaner.
Price 3 stars - $15 for 9 wings = $1.67 per wing. (WingStop $11.99 for 10 = $1.20 per wing, Buffalo Wild Wings $14.99 for 10 = $1.50, Chilis $15.59 for 8 = $1.95 per wing).

5 stars
This location is great and the chicken is always crispy and tasty. My fave is the Caribbean spice wings. It seems like the various locations have different version of the corn salad, but out of the 3 different locations I've had I rate this location's in the middle. It would be great if the delivery bags were sealed better, however.

Food is always fresh and chicken is so flavorful and crispy. Customer service as great.

Delicious chicken. The wings had a perfect crunch and cooked with pride. Service was excellent and the restaurant had a great vibe.

Korean fried chicken for the win! This was my last stop while visiting Frisco. Inside was nice and the wall display education on the chicken frying process was a good touch. 

Now I ordered the Honey Garlic wings w waffle fries. They came out smoking hot along with the crispy waffle fries. The sauce was great and the crunch was worth the trip. Now I couldn't finish my order so I took the rest with me and finished in the airport. Now at least 2hours had passed and even covered in sauce the Crunch was still there. I enjoyed these wings definitely a good choice

This place is so yummy!! That I had to try the tax's version.  We got a bunch of spicy food that I forgot to take a picture and ate it all!!

10/10 recommend this place for the best fried chicken!

Great food and amazing service!
I definitely would recommend this place.   Large orders so go hungry.

I love the Gingham style wings. I really wish they had a location closer in the Mesquite area. We're always satisfied with the food and service. I don't think it's a bad flavor on the menu.

2 stars
I really hate to do a negative review on a place where the food is soooo good. 

A little history. I've had their food, many many times, but call and order for pickup BUT today is the first time I have come in and ordered due to circumstances.

Place i

But man, customer service was not great. I'm taking the food to go. (To the hospital at that... who wants to have bad service when dealing with a situation like that)
Anywho, I asked since so many of the family is rotation out of the waiting room, if I can buy some large orders and either have him split it up in two boxes, or give me a couple extra boxes. He said no.
So I was explaining our situation. He said no again. So...
I said is it for the cost of the boxes? And he said probably. So I offered to buy a box and he said... you guessed it.... No.

So o could have ordered a lot of smaller orders, but because I ordered larges, I can't get an extra smaller box...

On another note... talking shit in Korean behind a customer's back may be ok for you, but I'm a Korean-American, and may not look it, but I understood every last insult. The ugly things the cashier say make me never want to come back.  

So if you want good food, they have it. 4.5 star worthy. If you want good service and honorable respect, go elsewhere.

2 stars
Food is great ans service is acceptable. However, we had a party of 7 and it was completely acceptable to charge the 18%  

What was not right was that after eating, 2 of us order  togo to take home to our family separately from our party, on a separate check. They charged us 18% on those take out orders. This was not very honest of them at all. I paid it with no argument but do not think we did not notice! That's very dishonest of your people. May 18. The party bill was 171.16. One of the take out orders was 56.20. Just to show you that this is a legit review/complaint

4 stars
I've never been to this BBQ chicken location but I thought that the decor looked better than most. Came here on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat without waiting. Overall had a good experience and the quality was on par with this chain. 

My wife and I got the secret spicy and hot spicy boneless chicken and both were fried well and had a good flavor. I'll come back if I'm in the area!

5 stars
Delicious chicken!  The marinating process is what makes the difference!  Honey garlic boneless was delicious.  Really enjoyed the corn salad.  Interior finish was very cozy yet modern.  Fun vibe!  Wait staff very friendly!

I wanted Korean fried chicken so we came here during lunch time on a Saturday after shopping.  I am still trying to find a Korean fried chicken that is better or the same as 99 Chicken back in Santa Clara.  Inside is nice and it looks bigger on the inside than on the outside.  If you do the yelp check in and ask for a free soda, they do not honor it anymore.

They have many different selections of chicken, we ordered the soy garlic and the honey garlic.  The chicken itself was great, but some of the pieces was a little dry.

Services was great.

1 stars
Ordered two large orders of wings, nearly 40 wings. Asked for extra rance and paid for it. Received one small tube of ranch. When i called, the extra ranch was the small tube. Lol... ok...wings were soggy. Won't be back!.

5 stars
Best fried chicken wings ever. Even though the wings are coated in sauce, the wings are super crunchy and have a great texture!

4 stars
If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!  

After a 20 minute wait and a quick jaunt to 99 Ranch, my wings came out beautifully boxed and ready to go.  

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!  

Now there are a lot of flavors.. we tried sweet and spicy and also honey garlic, BOTH of which we would get again as they were the finger licking good type of sauces.  

I'd be interested in trying Galbi flavor?!  I've not seen this as a flavor before for chicken... 

Be sure to checkout their sides as well to go with your chicken!  We got cheese sticks (our litmus test) but wished we had gotten some fries.

4 stars
As for the food, the whole chicken we got was very crispy and flavorful and was gone in just moments lol 

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

5 stars
Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

5 stars
The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

3 stars
the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

4 stars
It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

5 stars
Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

This barbecue chicken is always consistent. My wife and I love it, and we always take people to this location. Make sure you try the Caribbean flavor.

We decided to have a fun weekday dinner and settled on Korean fried chicken since we were in the area.
This spot is part of a well-known chain, so l already had high expectations for the quality-and they didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is a nice size, not too big or small, with TVs on the walls playing K-pop music videos, which added to the vibe. They also have booth seating in the back, which is great for small groups looking to enjoy chicken wings with some drinks.
We ordered the secret sauce wings and the spicy original wings. Both came out hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.
Korean fried chicken truly is the best-crispy, perfectly seasoned, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy.
They were even better piping hot! Each order also comes with pickled radish on the side, which is a nice touch.
Overall, this place is a fantastic choice for fried chicken. We'll definitely be coming back--again and again!

5 stars
What a nice little joint.  I've never had chicken wings like this ever before, or at least since Hooters was still good and could deliver crunchy fried and sauced wings that maintained the crunch.  Well, these folks make disgustingly good wings.  I don't know what sort of mega-chicken produce these drums and flats but even at 13$ for 9 wings, I couldn't stop but to finish them off in one sitting.  Hot, fresh, spicy (I got the hottest ones), nice cold Soju and other Korean fare.  You pop in and the cat behind the counter seats you swiftly, is responsive and while it takes a little bit to get your food, that just means it was done fresh and to order.  Novelty after you finish paying you get a token for the crane drop machine in the entry way (I got a lollipop heh).  Highly recommend.  Places like this in the N. Plano area are so plenty it makes me happy to go into the office, I look forward to lunch.  I'll be back here again.

YUM!

The chicken has the perfect crunch and moisture and serving size is massive. I love going here to eat. The staff are always friendly and definitely deserve a good tip. The restaurant is nice and clean and very cool. My favorite flavors are the cheesling, soy garlic, honey garlic, and gangjeong. I definitely recommend trying them!

5 stars
The place is quietly tucked away in the strip center so it was not busy when we there. We went based on a coworker's recommendation and this place did not disappoint us. 
The chicken is well cooked, crispy and flavorful. The person working was attentive and willing to help us when couldn't decide which flavors to get for our group. He even let us try some of the sauces before committing to the flavor. We had more than enough of chicken for our party of 4 and my personal favorite was the So Ddeok So Ddeok.

5 stars
Honey garlic chicken was fantastic! First time here but will definitely return. Ordered in person and food was ready in 15 mins. Staff was friendly and made sure we got our order once ready.

5 stars
Omg best wings!!! The Honey Garlic is my jam and their sweet potato fries ! The interior is very K-pop and the service is quick and efficient. Def give them a shot...you won't regret it

Love This crispy chicken and the selection of sauce. The hot is really spicy, and the garlic or soy is great.

You can't go wrong with crispy fried chicken, flavorful sauces, and the freshness of the pickled radish. We ordered the Gangman, spicy Galbi, and a third that I can't remember. We devoured all the wings and left satisfied. Service was good, staff were friendly.

5 stars
Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.
I give:
Staff 5 stars - so friendly and helpful.
Food 5 stars - very tasty, great temp, good portion.
Dining room cleanliness 5 stars - clean tables, clean floor.
Men's restroom 2 stars - I had to wash the sauce off of my hands and face, and would have liked the men's room to be cleaner.
Price 3 stars - $15 for 9 wings = $1.67 per wing. (WingStop $11.99 for 10 = $1.20 per wing, Buffalo Wild Wings $14.99 for 10 = $1.50, Chilis $15.59 for 8 = $1.95 per wing).

5 stars
This location is great and the chicken is always crispy and tasty. My fave is the Caribbean spice wings. It seems like the various locations have different version of the corn salad, but out of the 3 different locations I've had I rate this location's in the middle. It would be great if the delivery bags were sealed better, however.

Food is always fresh and chicken is so flavorful and crispy. Customer service as great.

Delicious chicken. The wings had a perfect crunch and cooked with pride. Service was excellent and the restaurant had a great vibe.

Korean fried chicken for the win! This was my last stop while visiting Frisco. Inside was nice and the wall display education on the chicken frying process was a good touch. 

Now I ordered the Honey Garlic wings w waffle fries. They came out smoking hot along with the crispy waffle fries. The sauce was great and the crunch was worth the trip. Now I couldn't finish my order so I took the rest with me and finished in the airport. Now at least 2hours had passed and even covered in sauce the Crunch was still there. I enjoyed these wings definitely a good choice

This place is so yummy!! That I had to try the tax's version.  We got a bunch of spicy food that I forgot to take a picture and ate it all!!

10/10 recommend this place for the best fried chicken!

Great food and amazing service!
I definitely would recommend this place.   Large orders so go hungry.

I love the Gingham style wings. I really wish they had a location closer in the Mesquite area. We're always satisfied with the food and service. I don't think it's a bad flavor on the menu.

2 stars
I really hate to do a negative review on a place where the food is soooo good. 

A little history. I've had their food, many many times, but call and order for pickup BUT today is the first time I have come in and ordered due to circumstances.

Place i

But man, customer service was not great. I'm taking the food to go. (To the hospital at that... who wants to have bad service when dealing with a situation like that)
Anywho, I asked since so many of the family is rotation out of the waiting room, if I can buy some large orders and either have him split it up in two boxes, or give me a couple extra boxes. He said no.
So I was explaining our situation. He said no again. So...
I said is it for the cost of the boxes? And he said probably. So I offered to buy a box and he said... you guessed it.... No.

So o could have ordered a lot of smaller orders, but because I ordered larges, I can't get an extra smaller box...

On another note... talking shit in Korean behind a customer's back may be ok for you, but I'm a Korean-American, and may not look it, but I understood every last insult. The ugly things the cashier say make me never want to come back.  

So if you want good food, they have it. 4.5 star worthy. If you want good service and honorable respect, go elsewhere.

2 stars
Food is great ans service is acceptable. However, we had a party of 7 and it was completely acceptable to charge the 18%  

What was not right was that after eating, 2 of us order  togo to take home to our family separately from our party, on a separate check. They charged us 18% on those take out orders. This was not very honest of them at all. I paid it with no argument but do not think we did not notice! That's very dishonest of your people. May 18. The party bill was 171.16. One of the take out orders was 56.20. Just to show you that this is a legit review/complaint

4 stars
I've never been to this BBQ chicken location but I thought that the decor looked better than most. Came here on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat without waiting. Overall had a good experience and the quality was on par with this chain. 

My wife and I got the secret spicy and hot spicy boneless chicken and both were fried well and had a good flavor. I'll come back if I'm in the area!

5 stars
Delicious chicken!  The marinating process is what makes the difference!  Honey garlic boneless was delicious.  Really enjoyed the corn salad.  Interior finish was very cozy yet modern.  Fun vibe!  Wait staff very friendly!

4 stars
I wanted Korean fried chicken so we came here during lunch time on a Saturday after shopping.  I am still trying to find a Korean fried chicken that is better or the same as 99 Chicken back in Santa Clara.  Inside is nice and it looks bigger on the inside than on the outside.  If you do the yelp check in and ask for a free soda, they do not honor it anymore.

They have many different selections of chicken, we ordered the soy garlic and the honey garlic.  The chicken itself was great, but some of the pieces was a little dry.

Services was great.

1 stars
Ordered two large orders of wings, nearly 40 wings. Asked for extra rance and paid for it. Received one small tube of ranch. When i called, the extra ranch was the small tube. Lol... ok...wings were soggy. Won't be back!.

5 stars
Best fried chicken wings ever. Even though the wings are coated in sauce, the wings are super crunchy and have a great texture!

4 stars
If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!  

After a 20 minute wait and a quick jaunt to 99 Ranch, my wings came out beautifully boxed and ready to go.  

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!  

Now there are a lot of flavors.. we tried sweet and spicy and also honey garlic, BOTH of which we would get again as they were the finger licking good type of sauces.  

I'd be interested in trying Galbi flavor?!  I've not seen this as a flavor before for chicken... 

Be sure to checkout their sides as well to go with your chicken!  We got cheese sticks (our litmus test) but wished we had gotten some fries.

4 stars
As for the food, the whole chicken we got was very crispy and flavorful and was gone in just moments lol 

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

5 stars
Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

5 stars
The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

3 stars
the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

4 stars
It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

5 stars
Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

Very rude woman who cannot communicate in English and gave me an attitude just because I cannot understand her. Extremely rude people. Will not give business to terrible people - this business

I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

4 stars
Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

3 stars
I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

4 stars
We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

5 stars
By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

2 stars
Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

5 stars
Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

3 stars
I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

5 stars
Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.
I give:
Staff 5 stars - so friendly and helpful.
Food 5 stars - very tasty, great temp, good portion.
Dining room cleanliness 5 stars - clean tables, clean floor.
Men's restroom 2 stars - I had to wash the sauce off of my hands and face, and would have liked the men's room to be cleaner.
Price 3 stars - $15 for 9 wings = $1.67 per wing. (WingStop $11.99 for 10 = $1.20 per wing, Buffalo Wild Wings $14.99 for 10 = $1.50, Chilis $15.59 for 8 = $1.95 per wing).

This location is great and the chicken is always crispy and tasty. My fave is the Caribbean spice wings. It seems like the various locations have different version of the corn salad, but out of the 3 different locations I've had I rate this location's in the middle. It would be great if the delivery bags were sealed better, however.

Food is always fresh and chicken is so flavorful and crispy. Customer service as great.

Delicious chicken. The wings had a perfect crunch and cooked with pride. Service was excellent and the restaurant had a great vibe.

Korean fried chicken for the win! This was my last stop while visiting Frisco. Inside was nice and the wall display education on the chicken frying process was a good touch. 

Now I ordered the Honey Garlic wings w waffle fries. They came out smoking hot along with the crispy waffle fries. The sauce was great and the crunch was worth the trip. Now I couldn't finish my order so I took the rest with me and finished in the airport. Now at least 2hours had passed and even covered in sauce the Crunch was still there. I enjoyed these wings definitely a good choice

This place is so yummy!! That I had to try the tax's version.  We got a bunch of spicy food that I forgot to take a picture and ate it all!!

10/10 recommend this place for the best fried chicken!

5 stars
Great food and amazing service!
I definitely would recommend this place.   Large orders so go hungry.

5 stars
I love the Gingham style wings. I really wish they had a location closer in the Mesquite area. We're always satisfied with the food and service. I don't think it's a bad flavor on the menu.

2 stars
I really hate to do a negative review on a place where the food is soooo good. 

A little history. I've had their food, many many times, but call and order for pickup BUT today is the first time I have come in and ordered due to circumstances.

Place i

But man, customer service was not great. I'm taking the food to go. (To the hospital at that... who wants to have bad service when dealing with a situation like that)
Anywho, I asked since so many of the family is rotation out of the waiting room, if I can buy some large orders and either have him split it up in two boxes, or give me a couple extra boxes. He said no.
So I was explaining our situation. He said no again. So...
I said is it for the cost of the boxes? And he said probably. So I offered to buy a box and he said... you guessed it.... No.

So o could have ordered a lot of smaller orders, but because I ordered larges, I can't get an extra smaller box...

On another note... talking shit in Korean behind a customer's back may be ok for you, but I'm a Korean-American, and may not look it, but I understood every last insult. The ugly things the cashier say make me never want to come back.  

So if you want good food, they have it. 4.5 star worthy. If you want good service and honorable respect, go elsewhere.

2 stars
Food is great ans service is acceptable. However, we had a party of 7 and it was completely acceptable to charge the 18%  

What was not right was that after eating, 2 of us order  togo to take home to our family separately from our party, on a separate check. They charged us 18% on those take out orders. This was not very honest of them at all. I paid it with no argument but do not think we did not notice! That's very dishonest of your people. May 18. The party bill was 171.16. One of the take out orders was 56.20. Just to show you that this is a legit review/complaint

4 stars
I've never been to this BBQ chicken location but I thought that the decor looked better than most. Came here on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat without waiting. Overall had a good experience and the quality was on par with this chain. 

My wife and I got the secret spicy and hot spicy boneless chicken and both were fried well and had a good flavor. I'll come back if I'm in the area!

5 stars
Delicious chicken!  The marinating process is what makes the difference!  Honey garlic boneless was delicious.  Really enjoyed the corn salad.  Interior finish was very cozy yet modern.  Fun vibe!  Wait staff very friendly!

4 stars
I wanted Korean fried chicken so we came here during lunch time on a Saturday after shopping.  I am still trying to find a Korean fried chicken that is better or the same as 99 Chicken back in Santa Clara.  Inside is nice and it looks bigger on the inside than on the outside.  If you do the yelp check in and ask for a free soda, they do not honor it anymore.

They have many different selections of chicken, we ordered the soy garlic and the honey garlic.  The chicken itself was great, but some of the pieces was a little dry.

Services was great.

1 stars
Ordered two large orders of wings, nearly 40 wings. Asked for extra rance and paid for it. Received one small tube of ranch. When i called, the extra ranch was the small tube. Lol... ok...wings were soggy. Won't be back!.

5 stars
Best fried chicken wings ever. Even though the wings are coated in sauce, the wings are super crunchy and have a great texture!

4 stars
If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!  

After a 20 minute wait and a quick jaunt to 99 Ranch, my wings came out beautifully boxed and ready to go.  

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!  

Now there are a lot of flavors.. we tried sweet and spicy and also honey garlic, BOTH of which we would get again as they were the finger licking good type of sauces.  

I'd be interested in trying Galbi flavor?!  I've not seen this as a flavor before for chicken... 

Be sure to checkout their sides as well to go with your chicken!  We got cheese sticks (our litmus test) but wished we had gotten some fries.

4 stars
As for the food, the whole chicken we got was very crispy and flavorful and was gone in just moments lol 

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

5 stars
Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

5 stars
The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

3 stars
the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

4 stars
It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

5 stars
Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

1 stars
Very rude woman who cannot communicate in English and gave me an attitude just because I cannot understand her. Extremely rude people. Will not give business to terrible people - this business

5 stars
I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

Food was decent, I got the little octopus balls and they tasted pretty got old quick.

Also had the corn salad, recommend. Good $2 purchase.

Ordering for takeout is supereasy. Staff pretty friendly

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

4 stars
Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

3 stars
I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

4 stars
We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

5 stars
By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

2 stars
Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

5 stars
Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

3 stars
I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

5 stars
Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

5 stars
We have this once a week, it's so good. Faves are the honey garlic and soy garlic boneless wings.

This barbecue chicken is always consistent. My wife and I love it, and we always take people to this location. Make sure you try the Caribbean flavor.

5 stars
We decided to have a fun weekday dinner and settled on Korean fried chicken since we were in the area.
This spot is part of a well-known chain, so l already had high expectations for the quality-and they didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is a nice size, not too big or small, with TVs on the walls playing K-pop music videos, which added to the vibe. They also have booth seating in the back, which is great for small groups looking to enjoy chicken wings with some drinks.
We ordered the secret sauce wings and the spicy original wings. Both came out hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.
Korean fried chicken truly is the best-crispy, perfectly seasoned, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy.
They were even better piping hot! Each order also comes with pickled radish on the side, which is a nice touch.
Overall, this place is a fantastic choice for fried chicken. We'll definitely be coming back--again and again!

5 stars
What a nice little joint.  I've never had chicken wings like this ever before, or at least since Hooters was still good and could deliver crunchy fried and sauced wings that maintained the crunch.  Well, these folks make disgustingly good wings.  I don't know what sort of mega-chicken produce these drums and flats but even at 13$ for 9 wings, I couldn't stop but to finish them off in one sitting.  Hot, fresh, spicy (I got the hottest ones), nice cold Soju and other Korean fare.  You pop in and the cat behind the counter seats you swiftly, is responsive and while it takes a little bit to get your food, that just means it was done fresh and to order.  Novelty after you finish paying you get a token for the crane drop machine in the entry way (I got a lollipop heh).  Highly recommend.  Places like this in the N. Plano area are so plenty it makes me happy to go into the office, I look forward to lunch.  I'll be back here again.

YUM!

5 stars
The chicken has the perfect crunch and moisture and serving size is massive. I love going here to eat. The staff are always friendly and definitely deserve a good tip. The restaurant is nice and clean and very cool. My favorite flavors are the cheesling, soy garlic, honey garlic, and gangjeong. I definitely recommend trying them!

5 stars
The place is quietly tucked away in the strip center so it was not busy when we there. We went based on a coworker's recommendation and this place did not disappoint us. 
The chicken is well cooked, crispy and flavorful. The person working was attentive and willing to help us when couldn't decide which flavors to get for our group. He even let us try some of the sauces before committing to the flavor. We had more than enough of chicken for our party of 4 and my personal favorite was the So Ddeok So Ddeok.

5 stars
Honey garlic chicken was fantastic! First time here but will definitely return. Ordered in person and food was ready in 15 mins. Staff was friendly and made sure we got our order once ready.

You can't go wrong with crispy fried chicken, flavorful sauces, and the freshness of the pickled radish. We ordered the Gangman, spicy Galbi, and a third that I can't remember. We devoured all the wings and left satisfied. Service was good, staff were friendly.

Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.

Now I couldn't finish my order so I took the rest with me and finished in the airport. Now at least 2hours had passed and even covered in sauce the Crunch was still there. I enjoyed these wings definitely a good choice

This place is so yummy!! That I had to try the tax's version.  We got a bunch of spicy food that I forgot to take a picture and ate it all!!

10/10 recommend this place for the best fried chicken!

Great food and amazing service!
I definitely would recommend this place.   Large orders so go hungry.

I love the Gingham style wings. I really wish they had a location closer in the Mesquite area. We're always satisfied with the food and service. I don't think it's a bad flavor on the menu.

I really hate to do a negative review on a place where the food is soooo good. 

A little history. I've had their food, many many times, but call and order for pickup BUT today is the first time I have come in and ordered due to circumstances.

Place i

But man, customer service was not great. I'm taking the food to go. (To the hospital at that... who wants to have bad service when dealing with a situation like that)
Anywho, I asked since so many of the family is rotation out of the waiting room, if I can buy some large orders and either have him split it up in two boxes, or give me a couple extra boxes. He said no.
So I was explaining our situation. He said no again. So...
I said is it for the cost of the boxes? And he said probably. So I offered to buy a box and he said... you guessed it.... No.

So o could have ordered a lot of smaller orders, but because I ordered larges, I can't get an extra smaller box...

On another note... talking shit in Korean behind a customer's back may be ok for you, but I'm a Korean-American, and may not look it, but I understood every last insult. The ugly things the cashier say make me never want to come back.  

So if you want good food, they have it. 4.5 star worthy. If you want good service and honorable respect, go elsewhere.

2 stars
Food is great ans service is acceptable. However, we had a party of 7 and it was completely acceptable to charge the 18%  

What was not right was that after eating, 2 of us order  togo to take home to our family separately from our party, on a separate check. They charged us 18% on those take out orders. This was not very honest of them at all. I paid it with no argument but do not think we did not notice! That's very dishonest of your people. May 18. The party bill was 171.16. One of the take out orders was 56.20. Just to show you that this is a legit review/complaint

I've never been to this BBQ chicken location but I thought that the decor looked better than most. Came here on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat without waiting. Overall had a good experience and the quality was on par with this chain. 

My wife and I got the secret spicy and hot spicy boneless chicken and both were fried well and had a good flavor. I'll come back if I'm in the area!

5 stars
Delicious chicken!  The marinating process is what makes the difference!  Honey garlic boneless was delicious.  Really enjoyed the corn salad.  Interior finish was very cozy yet modern.  Fun vibe!  Wait staff very friendly!

I wanted Korean fried chicken so we came here during lunch time on a Saturday after shopping.  I am still trying to find a Korean fried chicken that is better or the same as 99 Chicken back in Santa Clara.  Inside is nice and it looks bigger on the inside than on the outside.  If you do the yelp check in and ask for a free soda, they do not honor it anymore.

They have many different selections of chicken, we ordered the soy garlic and the honey garlic.  The chicken itself was great, but some of the pieces was a little dry.

Services was great.

Ordered two large orders of wings, nearly 40 wings. Asked for extra rance and paid for it. Received one small tube of ranch. When i called, the extra ranch was the small tube. Lol... ok...wings were soggy. Won't be back!.

5 stars
Best fried chicken wings ever. Even though the wings are coated in sauce, the wings are super crunchy and have a great texture!

4 stars
If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!  

After a 20 minute wait and a quick jaunt to 99 Ranch, my wings came out beautifully boxed and ready to go.  

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!  

Now there are a lot of flavors.. we tried sweet and spicy and also honey garlic, BOTH of which we would get again as they were the finger licking good type of sauces.  

I'd be interested in trying Galbi flavor?!  I've not seen this as a flavor before for chicken... 

Be sure to checkout their sides as well to go with your chicken!  We got cheese sticks (our litmus test) but wished we had gotten some fries.

4 stars
As for the food, the whole chicken we got was very crispy and flavorful and was gone in just moments lol 

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

5 stars
Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

5 stars
The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

3 stars
the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

4 stars
It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

5 stars
Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

Very rude woman who cannot communicate in English and gave me an attitude just because I cannot understand her. Extremely rude people. Will not give business to terrible people - this business

I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

3 stars
I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

4 stars
Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

4 stars
We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

5 stars
By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

2 stars
Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

5 stars
Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

3 stars
I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

5 stars
Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.

5 stars
We have this once a week, it's so good. Faves are the honey garlic and soy garlic boneless wings.

We decided to have a fun weekday dinner and settled on Korean fried chicken since we were in the area.
This spot is part of a well-known chain, so l already had high expectations for the quality-and they didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is a nice size, not too big or small, with TVs on the walls playing K-pop music videos, which added to the vibe. They also have booth seating in the back, which is great for small groups looking to enjoy chicken wings with some drinks.
We ordered the secret sauce wings and the spicy original wings. Both came out hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.
Korean fried chicken truly is the best-crispy, perfectly seasoned, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy.
They were even better piping hot! Each order also comes with pickled radish on the side, which is a nice touch.
Overall, this place is a fantastic choice for fried chicken. We'll definitely be coming back--again and again!

5 stars
What a nice little joint.  I've never had chicken wings like this ever before, or at least since Hooters was still good and could deliver crunchy fried and sauced wings that maintained the crunch.  Well, these folks make disgustingly good wings.  I don't know what sort of mega-chicken produce these drums and flats but even at 13$ for 9 wings, I couldn't stop but to finish them off in one sitting.  Hot, fresh, spicy (I got the hottest ones), nice cold Soju and other Korean fare.  You pop in and the cat behind the counter seats you swiftly, is responsive and while it takes a little bit to get your food, that just means it was done fresh and to order.  Novelty after you finish paying you get a token for the crane drop machine in the entry way (I got a lollipop heh).  Highly recommend.  Places like this in the N. Plano area are so plenty it makes me happy to go into the office, I look forward to lunch.  I'll be back here again.

YUM!

5 stars
The chicken has the perfect crunch and moisture and serving size is massive. I love going here to eat. The staff are always friendly and definitely deserve a good tip. The restaurant is nice and clean and very cool. My favorite flavors are the cheesling, soy garlic, honey garlic, and gangjeong. I definitely recommend trying them!

5 stars
The place is quietly tucked away in the strip center so it was not busy when we there. We went based on a coworker's recommendation and this place did not disappoint us. 
The chicken is well cooked, crispy and flavorful. The person working was attentive and willing to help us when couldn't decide which flavors to get for our group. He even let us try some of the sauces before committing to the flavor. We had more than enough of chicken for our party of 4 and my personal favorite was the So Ddeok So Ddeok.

5 stars
Honey garlic chicken was fantastic! First time here but will definitely return. Ordered in person and food was ready in 15 mins. Staff was friendly and made sure we got our order once ready.

You can't go wrong with crispy fried chicken, flavorful sauces, and the freshness of the pickled radish. We ordered the Gangman, spicy Galbi, and a third that I can't remember. We devoured all the wings and left satisfied. Service was good, staff were friendly.

Best bb.q chicken ever.  bb.q chicken franchises are spread across the country, and we've tried them in 3 different localities so far (Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas) and this location had the best version of Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) that I've tried so far...comparable to the best KFC in LA K-Town, and certainly better than any other bb.q.  It is located in a strip mall on the first floor, and there is plenty of shared parking.   We came during lunch on a Friday, and it was a bit busy.  This location does seem to be owned/operated as a family business, and their attention to detail really came through.

The inside is very similar to other bb.q location, with a large dining area, closed kitchen, and a large counter to handle the take-out business.   The four of us were seated promptly by the hostess, and each given laminated menus (exactly the same as the other locations).   Ordered a large (16) wing (honey garlic for $27), medium (8) wing (soy garlic for $15), and a basket of waffle fries ($7).   There is no soda fountain, only cans ($2...so obviously no free refills, though there is a check-in offer of free soda when buying a medium order).  They will give you a karafe of ice water so you can refill your water glasses at your leisure.  The fries came quickly, and a good version of waffle fries.  They were crispy, which was a good sign for the hoped-for crunchiness of the chicken to come.

The chicken took a bit of time, but was worth the wait.  Even after it had been tossed in the sauce, the twice-fried large chicken wings were very crispy.  Have no idea if the chicken had been frozen before, but for me it didn't matter...the crunch made all the difference.  The shell wasn't so hard that it shattered, but enough so there was absolutely no sogginess.  In this situation, I much prefer the 'flats':  maximum crunchey skin.  The two flavors ordered were fine, the honey one being very sweet with no spiciness at all.  The soy garlic was the right amount of salty.  Neither had much garlic flavor.  Some of the other sauces have more unami flavor.

Great service, throughout.  They even gave us extra pickled radishes, which I devoured (they are surprisingly expensive if you try to get them at H-mart)...it goes great with some of the hotter sauces, but were fine here.   One small suggestion would be to have single-use wet-naps available...this is hands-on eating and your fingers will get very sticky...a trip to the washroom to wash your hands is pretty much a necessity.

I was in the neighborhood and thought I would check out the eateries in a shopping center. Most of the places were Asian (maybe all Korean?)

This Korean chicken spot looked interesting, so I thought I would check it out. It just says "BBQ Chicken" on the door. It looks small from the outside, but inside there are plenty of tables to dine in.

The employees greet you with a very pleasant welcome when you come in. They ask if you are here to pick up an order. If you say no, they ask if you would like to dine in or place an order to go. If you tell them that you are dining in, they seat you at a table and give you a menu, and then they explain that any time you need anything, you can press a button on the corner of the table, and they will come right over, which I thought was a cool idea.

I ordered Medium Secret Sauce Wings, which the menu described as "A sweet and tangy take on our Golden Original." The server brought me my drink, a plate with napkin and fork, and a little stainless steel container with a liner for my chicken bones. I like this, as it is better than piling your bones on your plate or having to put them back with the uneaten chicken.

While I waited, I looked around the dining room and noticed that one wall shows their chicken-making process. I liked learning the steps that they use to make their chicken. The pop music playing in the dining room was not overly loud in my opinion. You could hold a conversation easily.

After an estimated 10-12 minutes, the server brought the chicken out with a little bowl on the side of pickled radish, which I had never had before. It was an interesting taste, better than raw radish, in my opinion.

The chicken was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced. It came out hot from the kitchen with beautiful steam rising from the wings. The chicken had no bare spots without sauce; the medium order came with 9 chicken wings (flats and drums). The wings were a good size. The chicken was fried nicely, and it was very tender and juicy. The menu description of the sauce being "sweet and tangy" was spot on. The taste fit my expectations perfectly, which was great because when I read the "sweet and tangy" description, it sparked a craving that was met with perfection.

My 9 wings order (which is described as "Medium" on the menu) was $15+tax ($16.24+tip). They had a "Large," which I think was $27.
I give:
Staff 5 stars - so friendly and helpful.
Food 5 stars - very tasty, great temp, good portion.
Dining room cleanliness 5 stars - clean tables, clean floor.
Men's restroom 2 stars - I had to wash the sauce off of my hands and face, and would have liked the men's room to be cleaner.
Price 3 stars - $15 for 9 wings = $1.67 per wing. (WingStop $11.99 for 10 = $1.20 per wing, Buffalo Wild Wings $14.99 for 10 = $1.50, Chilis $15.59 for 8 = $1.95 per wing).

5 stars
This location is great and the chicken is always crispy and tasty. My fave is the Caribbean spice wings. It seems like the various locations have different version of the corn salad, but out of the 3 different locations I've had I rate this location's in the middle. It would be great if the delivery bags were sealed better, however.

If you are looking for light crispy, just enough sauce to stick wings with a myriad of flavors (Korean inspired) THIS IS THE PLACE!

When we got home, the wings were still hot and the crunch was there!

As for the service, I ordered online and thought it would take a while so I kind of snuck in and sat by the door to wait for my text message. Shortly after that, a worker approached me to assist me and to my surprise it was already ready to go.

As for the ambiance, even though I didn't sit to eat, I could tell that it was a place that family's go often and it kind of felt like home.

Great place for wings or tenders. Also servers a variety of apps that look amazing. The spicy is truly spicy. The atmosphere inside is hip and clean.

The chicken is amazing. If you are ambivalent about the choice as to which fried chicken spot you would like to opt for the night, please don't hesitant to visit this chain.  The sauce fully coated every piece of chicken. Although I would say that they advertised the hot and spicy as very spicy, I don't think it is as spicy as I would preferred. The secret sauce flavor has a more tangy and sweet flavor.

the chicken is solid, but the service is not.

we came in on a weekday afternoon when the restaurant was not busy and ordered one lunch chicken basket to share as a snack. after ordering, the waitress came back several minutes later to tell us that she got in trouble because we didn't order enough but they would "let it slide because she made the mistake of accepting the order" and pointed toward her boss. There is no minimum order requirement listed on the menu, nor was this explained to us when we were ordering. It felt awkward and we felt manipulated to order more even though we knew we weren't hungry enough to finish two baskets.

The ambiance was fine - the restaurant wasn't bustling with guests but it was a little confusing because each of the TVs was playing a different K-pop video but only one was playing sound so it was very disorienting. Otherwise the decoration was fine.

The chicken is a solid standard for chain korean fried chicken - crispy and saucy. It's consistent with the other locations I've visited. Unfortunately, our experience with the service seriously decreased our enjoyment of the meal, particularly because we could see the workers standing behind the counter looking over at us and very clearly talking about us. I might come here for the takeout chicken again but I'm very hesitant to return for sit down service

It's so easy to order online and pick up. The chicken here is so tender and juicy with the right amount of crunch. I typically go for the boneless wings and really favor the honey garlic. My mom doesn't always love fried chicken, but when I brought a box home, she loved the honey garlic and raves about how good it was.
The downside is this place is quite pricy imo. It's around $17 for a medium box. Upgrade to a large and that runs you $28 (before tax). I'd love to eat this place more often, but it's a bit pricey so I will treat myself every once in a while.

Craving some fried chicken, so we decided to try some Korean style fried chicken and we were not disappointed! We had the boneless secret spicy and soy garlic with a side of fries. The chicken was deliciously crunchy yet moist, the crunchiest chicken we've ever had! It was very fresh and tender. Our favorite was the secret spicy - no surprise. 

Regular fries unfortunately were unimpressive, they were hot and fresh but bland. You can tell they were fresh from the fryer though. 

Atmosphere is pleasant with good service. They were committed to mask usage and cleaned appropriately after each customer. 

This is a place we will definitely come back to and will need to try other flavors!

My family and I love bb.q chicken. However yesterday's experience left me a little disappointed. My husband and I and our 2 toddlers visited this location and ordered our usual and an order of fries and boneless chicken with no seasoning (we explained this to the waitress that we did not want it to be spicy) for our children. My toddler kept screaming that it was hot. I tasted it and sure enough it was spicier than my husbands order. The waitress explained that the chicken was fried in the same oil as the other orders and so that's why it's spicy. She didn't care to remake it so it would at least be edible by a toddler. She just smiled and went back to chatting with the other staff. For a Sunday (Father's Day) this place was quiet we were the only ones dining in. To go orders trickled in here and there. I would not return with my kiddos to eat here.

Very rude woman who cannot communicate in English and gave me an attitude just because I cannot understand her. Extremely rude people. Will not give business to terrible people - this business

I ordered the medium wings with their spicy flavor just to check them out.  Had I known about their "secret sauce," I would have ordered that too, but I will know for next time.  The wings are crispy, flavored really well, and it was delivered in a cute little to go box.  They are decently priced, and I am looking forward to checking out other items off their menu.  I highly recommend their wings!

I shouldn't eat fried foods often, but when I do have that craving for being a bad girl, this is the only fried chicken worth the high cholesterol and calories. We tried multiple flavors, and all were delicious, crispy, and juicy!

Who doesn't love some Korean fried chicken? Sadly, this location doesn't sell alcohol so no soju or beer to accompany your spicy birds. The service was the worst part of this place. There were only 2 tables of people in the restaurant, but it took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We didn't get forks and napkins until after we received our food. Our cups were consistently empty and the other table was having to resort to waving people down. 

The curly fries were all stuck together, but the taste and crunch was awesome. This was a good indicator for the chicken to come. The rice cakes tasted fried and were covered in a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. 

We ordered the soy garlic, special hot, and extra hot wings. Even while coated in sauce, they maintained their crunch. What was a little different but enjoyable was the texture of the batter was almost tempura like leaving a light and airy crunch. The sauces all had an after taste of browned sugar similar to maple syrup. I do wish they were a little less sweet, but they were all tasty! The extra hot is about the same heat as a raw jalapeño. 

This place will definitely satisfy your wing craving.

I'm a regular shopper at 99 Ranch next door, so when I kept seeing cars parked outside of this restaurant and waiters coming out with bags of food, I wanted to try it out. The first two times we got addicted! What's not to love when you have crispy chicken coated in sweet garlicky sauce? Even their golden olive chicken is good when your tongue wants to take a break from the heat, or if you have kids. 

We went back a couple of times but this is probably it. We always order whole chicken but you wonder how much you are really getting. The chicken breasts were cut up into several smaller pieces, but it doesn't seem like we are getting a whole chicken. The last order we only had a few small pieces of white meat that made up maybe one chicken breast, and what we thought were thighs. Wrong! Those "thighs" were just breast carcass. Yes carcass because the breast meat above had been cut away. Yes we got several batter fried breast carcasses. The first piece were half eaten, so to be sure I cut another piece in half before eating as proof.

When I am paying close to $25 for a whole chicken I expect to get a chicken, not its remains only. Perhaps the breast meat went to someone else's boneless chicken order. Too bad if we crave fried chicken we have to go back to KFC. Not the tastiest but at least the family will be fed.

Good Korean fried chicken. I love their cheesling boneless flavor. Their fries are always on point! I would pass on their spicy rice cake. Their regular fried chicken is good and had a nice crispy skin.

We ordered take out online. Their website made it very easy to place your order. 
The chicken were very crispy on the outside and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender inside. The perfect combo for Korean fried chicken. My boys were devouring the chicken and said that this is their new favorite chicken. I also appreciate that the batter on the chicken was not too spicy (perfect for my kids). They also had a great choice of sauces to add to your chicken. 
The prices are fair but everything is extra (even the sweet daikon radish). So it can add up easily once you order your chicken and sides. 

A good choice among so many korean fried chicken places here in North Dallas area. We will be back!

By far my favorite Korean fried chicken place. They just opened up along 75 and Spring Creek and it is so convenient to have a BBQ Chicken closer to home! They are only doing to-go at the moment but the food was good nonetheless.

We ordered BB Wings, Honey Garlic Wings and their Secret Spicy Whole Chciken. Also ordered some sweet potato fries on the side! Honey Garlic was our favorite with the right amount of savory and sweetness! Both BB Wings and Secret Spicy were mildly spicy but still really good.

Carryout order, I order original golden spicy bone-in wings, which is what I normally order, got home and was very disappointed the order was wrong, no wings at all, but whole chicken, I hate chicken breast.  I confirmed with person who took order and again when they completed and brought order to me.  This is the 2nd time I got home and my order was wrong, note to self if I return to this place to check order before leaving.  I was not happy with what I received and paid for, very disappoint with this meal.

Oh! Everyone was so nice here! I got makgoelli and it was banana! I really liked it. It went well with the galbi boneless wings we had. Nice and crispy and deeeeelicious! They have several kinds of boneless, with wings and even a chicken! Plus, they have soju in various flavors too. I wanted to try some appetizers but its a lot of chicken. I decided to save some tastiness for my next visit. My son and I used to visit Rice Chicken but it closed but now we found our new FAVE KFC place!

I love the flavor. The sweet, spicy, and savory sauce is all there in the chicken, and the meat is so juicy and tender. However, it doesn't have that crispy, crunchy bite that I would expect from Korean fried chicken. I got the Secret Spice which is very savory and sweet. They have a cool lunch special and you can even order larger bundles of chicken. I would recommend this place to someone. The vibe is fun, and the workers are fun to talk to. I'll come for the flavor rather than the crisp.
(Also, the amount of chicken they give it HUGE... i love that part)

Sooo glad a BBQ Chicken has opened close to me! No longer have to drive to Carrolton for delicious KFC (korean fried chicken). We ordered five lunch specials on a Saturday for pickup  and it only took 25 mins, which seems muuuch faster than the other location, maybe due to no dine in? Anyway all of them were filled to the brim with hot crispy chicken even though we were a little late on picking them up, probably due to their genius box packaging (they have a little spot for ventilation!) 

It's nice that this location is right next to a 99 Ranch, you can order and go grocery shopping while you wait. We got cheesling, soy garlic, and special spicy, all of them were great but cheesling is still my favorite. The inside decor/ambience is very cozy, it'll be nice to dine in once the world is a little less turned upside down.
