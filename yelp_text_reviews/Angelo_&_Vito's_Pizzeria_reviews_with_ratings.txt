Review: So I have to say this is by far the best New York Style pizza place in the Dallas area that I have tried, and I have tried a lot. We always take it to go, but I will state that we have a New York Style pizza place a block away and I drive all the way to Independence for this pizza. So pizza gets 5-stars. Why 4 stars on my review? Because after ordering an XL cheese pizza for kids I wanted one slice with veggies on it and they charged me half the price of an entire pizza. They charged me for every pizza topping. A $12 slice of pizza is absolute insanity even with this ridiculous inflation. So I will continue to buy pies for the kids, but will no longer buy myself what I want from there.

Review: Ordered cheese pizza and spaghetti and meatballs to go. Very authentic spaghetti sauce, with many chunks of real tomato. Very tasty. Wonderful spaghetti. Large meatballs and tasty. Cheese pizza with very tasty too. You could tell the pizza sauce was made from scratch, you could see the small chunks of tomato.  Great meal.

Review: Get 2 go pizza here when I'm in the mood for NY pizza. Not always done when promised, sometimes seems a little slow but that's probably because they always seem busy with take out orders. Pretty big area to dine in which we haven't done. Supports locals schools with spirit nights!  Canoli dessert also pretty good, filled to order. Great crust and sauce to pizza ratio.

Review: This is a well established pizza joint in Plano. Purchased a couple of calzones and a small pizza. 
It's very average in comparison to other pizza restaurants in the area. I believe the Pizza Hut across the street is better. Plenty of area pizza places to choose from. A number of them are less worthy than Angelo & Vito's.

Review: I am certain we ordered the wrong things because everyone is writing comments about how delicious the pizzas are but we unfortunate didn't order pizza! We got the chicken Parmesan, linguini Alfredo, and Italian combo sandwich. The side salads and bread that came with the entrees were very delicious considering they were complimentary. The Alfredo sauce was pretty good but plain for the linguini Alfredo. The chicken Parmesan was huge in portion but the chicken tasted cheap like a huge chicken nugget. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce as well. The Italian combo sandwich was large and great for the value but was doused in Caesar dressing. I also wish the bread was toasted. 

So what I got from this restaurant is it's very affordable and you get a lot of food for your money but the quality is definitely not there. Maybe I will have to try a pizza since I am seeing positive comments about that. 

Restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night and the lighting is a bit dark. So overall, wasn't the best eating experience but that is all.

40 for a sub sub par pizza... go to Walmart buy totinos and save yourself some cash.  Same service and flavor

Drive on, there are many other choices... this is not worth the Stop

Review: First time visit and when we walked into the place it looked small, clean and quiet. Staff was friendly.
We had the mamá mía pizza, half traditional. It was delicious loaded with toppings and cheese. We also ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it too was delicious very authentic. The food was perfect and very affordable. My family and I will definitely be back for more!

Review: Delicious NY style pizza! Very fast, you can order by the slice or you can order a whole pizza. Tastes really authentic and has a lot of flavor, especially if you add the spices that are on the side. I think they had some garlic type spice you can sprinkle on, which was really good. 
It's also really fresh. Highly recommend!

Review: went there because everyone wanted pizza. The only worker was sitting at a table on his phone and once we walked in he went behind the register ready to take our order everytime we spoke to give him our order he repeated the wrong thing and you could barley hear him. the tables where dirty and no one was even in the restaurant. it took thirty minutes for a few pizza slices and a pasta to be done and it wasnt busy the food was kinda good but I wouldnt go again.

Review: Ordered delivery from here for the first time. The pizza came hot. The crust was thin and cooked perfectly. I ordered a cheese pizza with jalapeño. I asked for extra cheese and sauce. The large size was good for 1 person to have an extra meal at a later time. If ordering for two it would be good for 1 meal. If big eaters order a side to have the pizza for more than one meal. The flavor was good. I prefer fresh ingredients so this place met the expectations. Even though I ordered extra sauce the cheese and jalapeño stood out over the sauce. So I can't really say that the sauce was the best I ever had. I like the upscale branding with an affordable price point. When I order pizza again I will order from here.

Review: Tried their pizzas for the first time and sadly I would not order from them again.

Their Mama Mia pizza tasted ok.  Nothing wrong with that one.

Then I took a look at the Margherita pizza and it didn't look right.  Looked like a cheese pizza with diced tomatoes on top, with no red sauce underneath at all.  So it wasn't even a normal cheese pizza.  Tasted bad.

Their wings were just soft and soggy.  

There are many pizza places out there that can do much better.

Review: I've had pizza from Dallas to Frisco and parts in between. So yes, I'm a little crazy about Pizza, maybe order once a week. With that said, I really love Angelo & Vito's, top 5 in the metroplex in my opinion. Don't order it as much as I should, but when I do, it is always outstanding. They don't skimp on toppings, and when you order X cheese, they get it, which is important to me.

Give it a try and you will like it. I just ordered on Door Dash and I live in Frisco, the pizza arrived early and still hot. 

Just my personal opinion, so try it and judge for yourself.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Angelo and Vito's is always our go to pizza place! The chicken pesto pizza is our favorite. The people here are always nice and they make sure everything we order is always to our satisfaction. We've enjoyed the meat lovers pizza also.

Review: I like everything about this pizza. Perfect crust. Yes, it's a little more than Pizza Hut, dominos, or little Caesar's, but A&Vs is using real cheese and not that fake "cheese food" that the other big chains are using. Try it out, you'll see what I mean.

Review: We came here on a Sunday evening and it was pretty empty. While we were there, most people were getting their orders to go. The menu is vast including pizza, pasta, sandwiches, etc. The price is definitely good and the value is even better. We ordered and then sat with our group and had an entire section to ourselves. There is also a small arcade with some games for the kids. The inside was clean and had that old time pizzeria feel.

We got an Italian combo sandwich, a medium pepperoni pizza, and pasta with alfredo sauce. My sandwich was hot and the bread was toasty. There was a bit too much lettuce for my liking though and the sauce was too sweet and overpowering. I like tasting the meat and other ingredients. The pizza was huge for a medium and was thin, NY style. I was told the pasta was average. We also tried some pepperoni rolls and those were great, along with visually seeing our friend's calzone which was huge!! All in all, a good family place for an outing.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: We've had pizza here a couple of times and dinner once. The pizza is thin an cheesy - just like my husband has been searching for! It's delicious. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 star is both times I've had their pizza by the slice, my crust seemed a little overcooked.  The first time it even tasted a little burned. Otherwise a delicious pizza

Review: Been visiting for years when I want NY style pizza. Just the right crunch on the pie with a chewy crust. Our norm is a pie with pepperoni and mushroom plus the cheese-sticks or a cheese pizza. (A giant will feed a hardy family of four.). Always quality with that right amount of cheese that your toppings don't slide but enough to savoy the sauce. 

Every pie is different. Somethings we laugh when we get one because it was made a little too bug for the box but would slide if it was in the next size. It is not a negative to us - just shows that they are working hard to deliver a good product. 

Customer Service is good too. I've never sat down to eat, nor have I opted for delivery however take out is always correct and hot. 

Baking time is quick, which is a bonus as I will normally pick up on the way home. This is one of those go-to places that always gets it right for us.

Review: This review really isn't about the quality of the food. They have great pizza and pretty darn good sandwiches.

It's about the business.

I've ordered from them a handful of times.

My 2nd or 3rd order was incorrect and I reached out to GrubHub about it.

Simple complaint. I got the wrong pizza.

So.. fast forward a couple of weeks and I order again.

I get a call from the restaurant.

I am told that they will deliver *this time*, but I have been flagged in their system for canceling orders 4 or 5 times.

Sorry. What the hell? You sent me the wrong pizza *one time*. I complained *one time*. And I am flagged in your system as a multiple time problem customer????

I really like your food, but I'll never eat it again.

Review: I have been to this place a few times in the past and they are always good. You don't have to wait a long time for your pizza and you can tell the dough is fresh. The crust is always perfect and I just love the pizza here. I never feel overly stuffed after eating and of course, the pizza is always good the next day too! The guys that work there are friendly and there are also games for the kids to play in. They deliver through Yelp as well and the last time I did an order through them, it still did not disappoint!

Review: I have been to this place a few times in the past and they are always good. You don't have to wait a long time for your pizza and you can tell the dough is fresh. The crust is always perfect and I just love the pizza here. I never feel overly stuffed after eating and of course, the pizza is always good the next day too! The guys that work there are friendly and there are also games for the kids to play in. They deliver through Yelp as well and the last time I did an order through them, it still did not disappoint!

Review: So I have to say this is by far the best New York Style pizza place in the Dallas area that I have tried, and I have tried a lot. We always take it to go, but I will state that we have a New York Style pizza place a block away and I drive all the way to Independence for this pizza. So pizza gets 5-stars. Why 4 stars on my review? Because after ordering an XL cheese pizza for kids I wanted one slice with veggies on it and they charged me half the price of an entire pizza. They charged me for every pizza topping. A $12 slice of pizza is absolute insanity even with this ridiculous inflation. So I will continue to buy pies for the kids, but will no longer buy myself what I want from there.

Review: Ordered cheese pizza and spaghetti and meatballs to go. Very authentic spaghetti sauce, with many chunks of real tomato. Very tasty. Wonderful spaghetti. Large meatballs and tasty. Cheese pizza with very tasty too. You could tell the pizza sauce was made from scratch, you could see the small chunks of tomato.  Great meal.

Review: Get 2 go pizza here when I'm in the mood for NY pizza. Not always done when promised, sometimes seems a little slow but that's probably because they always seem busy with take out orders. Pretty big area to dine in which we haven't done. Supports locals schools with spirit nights!  Canoli dessert also pretty good, filled to order. Great crust and sauce to pizza ratio.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: This is a well established pizza joint in Plano. Purchased a couple of calzones and a small pizza. 
It's very average in comparison to other pizza restaurants in the area. I believe the Pizza Hut across the street is better. Plenty of area pizza places to choose from. A number of them are less worthy than Angelo & Vito's.

Review: I am certain we ordered the wrong things because everyone is writing comments about how delicious the pizzas are but we unfortunate didn't order pizza! We got the chicken Parmesan, linguini Alfredo, and Italian combo sandwich. The side salads and bread that came with the entrees were very delicious considering they were complimentary. The Alfredo sauce was pretty good but plain for the linguini Alfredo. The chicken Parmesan was huge in portion but the chicken tasted cheap like a huge chicken nugget. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce as well. The Italian combo sandwich was large and great for the value but was doused in Caesar dressing. I also wish the bread was toasted. 

So what I got from this restaurant is it's very affordable and you get a lot of food for your money but the quality is definitely not there. Maybe I will have to try a pizza since I am seeing positive comments about that. 

Restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night and the lighting is a bit dark. So overall, wasn't the best eating experience but that is all.

40 for a sub sub par pizza... go to Walmart buy totinos and save yourself some cash.  Same service and flavor

Drive on, there are many other choices... this is not worth the Stop

Review: First time visit and when we walked into the place it looked small, clean and quiet. Staff was friendly.
We had the mamá mía pizza, half traditional. It was delicious loaded with toppings and cheese. We also ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it too was delicious very authentic. The food was perfect and very affordable. My family and I will definitely be back for more!

Review: Delicious NY style pizza! Very fast, you can order by the slice or you can order a whole pizza. Tastes really authentic and has a lot of flavor, especially if you add the spices that are on the side. I think they had some garlic type spice you can sprinkle on, which was really good. 
It's also really fresh. Highly recommend!

Review: went there because everyone wanted pizza. The only worker was sitting at a table on his phone and once we walked in he went behind the register ready to take our order everytime we spoke to give him our order he repeated the wrong thing and you could barley hear him. the tables where dirty and no one was even in the restaurant. it took thirty minutes for a few pizza slices and a pasta to be done and it wasnt busy the food was kinda good but I wouldnt go again.

Review: Ordered delivery from here for the first time. The pizza came hot. The crust was thin and cooked perfectly. I ordered a cheese pizza with jalapeño. I asked for extra cheese and sauce. The large size was good for 1 person to have an extra meal at a later time. If ordering for two it would be good for 1 meal. If big eaters order a side to have the pizza for more than one meal. The flavor was good. I prefer fresh ingredients so this place met the expectations. Even though I ordered extra sauce the cheese and jalapeño stood out over the sauce. So I can't really say that the sauce was the best I ever had. I like the upscale branding with an affordable price point. When I order pizza again I will order from here.

Review: Tried their pizzas for the first time and sadly I would not order from them again.

Their Mama Mia pizza tasted ok.  Nothing wrong with that one.

Then I took a look at the Margherita pizza and it didn't look right.  Looked like a cheese pizza with diced tomatoes on top, with no red sauce underneath at all.  So it wasn't even a normal cheese pizza.  Tasted bad.

Their wings were just soft and soggy.  

There are many pizza places out there that can do much better.

Review: I've had pizza from Dallas to Frisco and parts in between. So yes, I'm a little crazy about Pizza, maybe order once a week. With that said, I really love Angelo & Vito's, top 5 in the metroplex in my opinion. Don't order it as much as I should, but when I do, it is always outstanding. They don't skimp on toppings, and when you order X cheese, they get it, which is important to me.

Give it a try and you will like it. I just ordered on Door Dash and I live in Frisco, the pizza arrived early and still hot. 

Just my personal opinion, so try it and judge for yourself.

Review: I like everything about this pizza. Perfect crust. Yes, it's a little more than Pizza Hut, dominos, or little Caesar's, but A&Vs is using real cheese and not that fake "cheese food" that the other big chains are using. Try it out, you'll see what I mean.

Review: We came here on a Sunday evening and it was pretty empty. While we were there, most people were getting their orders to go. The menu is vast including pizza, pasta, sandwiches, etc. The price is definitely good and the value is even better. We ordered and then sat with our group and had an entire section to ourselves. There is also a small arcade with some games for the kids. The inside was clean and had that old time pizzeria feel.

We got an Italian combo sandwich, a medium pepperoni pizza, and pasta with alfredo sauce. My sandwich was hot and the bread was toasty. There was a bit too much lettuce for my liking though and the sauce was too sweet and overpowering. I like tasting the meat and other ingredients. The pizza was huge for a medium and was thin, NY style. I was told the pasta was average. We also tried some pepperoni rolls and those were great, along with visually seeing our friend's calzone which was huge!! All in all, a good family place for an outing.

Rating: 4 stars
Review: We've had pizza here a couple of times and dinner once. The pizza is thin an cheesy - just like my husband has been searching for! It's delicious. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 star is both times I've had their pizza by the slice, my crust seemed a little overcooked.  The first time it even tasted a little burned. Otherwise a delicious pizza

Review: Been visiting for years when I want NY style pizza. Just the right crunch on the pie with a chewy crust. Our norm is a pie with pepperoni and mushroom plus the cheese-sticks or a cheese pizza. (A giant will feed a hardy family of four.). Always quality with that right amount of cheese that your toppings don't slide but enough to savoy the sauce. 

Every pie is different. Somethings we laugh when we get one because it was made a little too bug for the box but would slide if it was in the next size. It is not a negative to us - just shows that they are working hard to deliver a good product. 

Customer Service is good too. I've never sat down to eat, nor have I opted for delivery however take out is always correct and hot. 

Baking time is quick, which is a bonus as I will normally pick up on the way home. This is one of those go-to places that always gets it right for us.

Review: This review really isn't about the quality of the food. They have great pizza and pretty darn good sandwiches.

It's about the business.

I've ordered from them a handful of times.

My 2nd or 3rd order was incorrect and I reached out to GrubHub about it.

Simple complaint. I got the wrong pizza.

So.. fast forward a couple of weeks and I order again.

I get a call from the restaurant.

I am told that they will deliver *this time*, but I have been flagged in their system for canceling orders 4 or 5 times.

Sorry. What the hell? You sent me the wrong pizza *one time*. I complained *one time*. And I am flagged in your system as a multiple time problem customer????

I really like your food, but I'll never eat it again.

Bad form, Angelo and Vitos. Very bad form.

Sorry. What the hell? You sent me the wrong pizza *one time*. I complained *one time*. And I am flagged in your system as a multiple time problem customer????

I really like your food, but I'll never eat it again.

Bad form, Angelo and Vitos. Very bad form.

Review: I have been to this place a few times in the past and they are always good. You don't have to wait a long time for your pizza and you can tell the dough is fresh. The crust is always perfect and I just love the pizza here. I never feel overly stuffed after eating and of course, the pizza is always good the next day too! The guys that work there are friendly and there are also games for the kids to play in. They deliver through Yelp as well and the last time I did an order through them, it still did not disappoint!

Review: So I have to say this is by far the best New York Style pizza place in the Dallas area that I have tried, and I have tried a lot. We always take it to go, but I will state that we have a New York Style pizza place a block away and I drive all the way to Independence for this pizza. So pizza gets 5-stars. Why 4 stars on my review? Because after ordering an XL cheese pizza for kids I wanted one slice with veggies on it and they charged me half the price of an entire pizza. They charged me for every pizza topping. A $12 slice of pizza is absolute insanity even with this ridiculous inflation. So I will continue to buy pies for the kids, but will no longer buy myself what I want from there.

Review: Ordered cheese pizza and spaghetti and meatballs to go. Very authentic spaghetti sauce, with many chunks of real tomato. Very tasty. Wonderful spaghetti. Large meatballs and tasty. Cheese pizza with very tasty too. You could tell the pizza sauce was made from scratch, you could see the small chunks of tomato.  Great meal.

Review: Get 2 go pizza here when I'm in the mood for NY pizza. Not always done when promised, sometimes seems a little slow but that's probably because they always seem busy with take out orders. Pretty big area to dine in which we haven't done. Supports locals schools with spirit nights!  Canoli dessert also pretty good, filled to order. Great crust and sauce to pizza ratio.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: This is a well established pizza joint in Plano. Purchased a couple of calzones and a small pizza. 
It's very average in comparison to other pizza restaurants in the area. I believe the Pizza Hut across the street is better. Plenty of area pizza places to choose from. A number of them are less worthy than Angelo & Vito's.

Review: I am certain we ordered the wrong things because everyone is writing comments about how delicious the pizzas are but we unfortunate didn't order pizza! We got the chicken Parmesan, linguini Alfredo, and Italian combo sandwich. The side salads and bread that came with the entrees were very delicious considering they were complimentary. The Alfredo sauce was pretty good but plain for the linguini Alfredo. The chicken Parmesan was huge in portion but the chicken tasted cheap like a huge chicken nugget. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce as well. The Italian combo sandwich was large and great for the value but was doused in Caesar dressing. I also wish the bread was toasted. 

So what I got from this restaurant is it's very affordable and you get a lot of food for your money but the quality is definitely not there. Maybe I will have to try a pizza since I am seeing positive comments about that. 

Restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night and the lighting is a bit dark. So overall, wasn't the best eating experience but that is all.

40 for a sub sub par pizza... go to Walmart buy totinos and save yourself some cash.  Same service and flavor

Drive on, there are many other choices... this is not worth the Stop

Review: First time visit and when we walked into the place it looked small, clean and quiet. Staff was friendly.
We had the mamá mía pizza, half traditional. It was delicious loaded with toppings and cheese. We also ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it too was delicious very authentic. The food was perfect and very affordable. My family and I will definitely be back for more!

Review: Delicious NY style pizza! Very fast, you can order by the slice or you can order a whole pizza. Tastes really authentic and has a lot of flavor, especially if you add the spices that are on the side. I think they had some garlic type spice you can sprinkle on, which was really good. 
It's also really fresh. Highly recommend!

Review: went there because everyone wanted pizza. The only worker was sitting at a table on his phone and once we walked in he went behind the register ready to take our order everytime we spoke to give him our order he repeated the wrong thing and you could barley hear him. the tables where dirty and no one was even in the restaurant. it took thirty minutes for a few pizza slices and a pasta to be done and it wasnt busy the food was kinda good but I wouldnt go again.

Review: Ordered delivery from here for the first time. The pizza came hot. The crust was thin and cooked perfectly. I ordered a cheese pizza with jalapeño. I asked for extra cheese and sauce. The large size was good for 1 person to have an extra meal at a later time. If ordering for two it would be good for 1 meal. If big eaters order a side to have the pizza for more than one meal. The flavor was good. I prefer fresh ingredients so this place met the expectations. Even though I ordered extra sauce the cheese and jalapeño stood out over the sauce. So I can't really say that the sauce was the best I ever had. I like the upscale branding with an affordable price point. When I order pizza again I will order from here.

Review: Tried their pizzas for the first time and sadly I would not order from them again.

Their Mama Mia pizza tasted ok.  Nothing wrong with that one.

Then I took a look at the Margherita pizza and it didn't look right.  Looked like a cheese pizza with diced tomatoes on top, with no red sauce underneath at all.  So it wasn't even a normal cheese pizza.  Tasted bad.

Their wings were just soft and soggy.  

There are many pizza places out there that can do much better.

Review: I've had pizza from Dallas to Frisco and parts in between. So yes, I'm a little crazy about Pizza, maybe order once a week. With that said, I really love Angelo & Vito's, top 5 in the metroplex in my opinion. Don't order it as much as I should, but when I do, it is always outstanding. They don't skimp on toppings, and when you order X cheese, they get it, which is important to me.

Give it a try and you will like it. I just ordered on Door Dash and I live in Frisco, the pizza arrived early and still hot. 

Just my personal opinion, so try it and judge for yourself.

Review: I like everything about this pizza. Perfect crust. Yes, it's a little more than Pizza Hut, dominos, or little Caesar's, but A&Vs is using real cheese and not that fake "cheese food" that the other big chains are using. Try it out, you'll see what I mean.

Review: We came here on a Sunday evening and it was pretty empty. While we were there, most people were getting their orders to go. The menu is vast including pizza, pasta, sandwiches, etc. The price is definitely good and the value is even better. We ordered and then sat with our group and had an entire section to ourselves. There is also a small arcade with some games for the kids. The inside was clean and had that old time pizzeria feel.

We got an Italian combo sandwich, a medium pepperoni pizza, and pasta with alfredo sauce. My sandwich was hot and the bread was toasty. There was a bit too much lettuce for my liking though and the sauce was too sweet and overpowering. I like tasting the meat and other ingredients. The pizza was huge for a medium and was thin, NY style. I was told the pasta was average. We also tried some pepperoni rolls and those were great, along with visually seeing our friend's calzone which was huge!! All in all, a good family place for an outing.

Review: We've had pizza here a couple of times and dinner once. The pizza is thin an cheesy - just like my husband has been searching for! It's delicious. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 star is both times I've had their pizza by the slice, my crust seemed a little overcooked.  The first time it even tasted a little burned. Otherwise a delicious pizza

Review: Been visiting for years when I want NY style pizza. Just the right crunch on the pie with a chewy crust. Our norm is a pie with pepperoni and mushroom plus the cheese-sticks or a cheese pizza. (A giant will feed a hardy family of four.). Always quality with that right amount of cheese that your toppings don't slide but enough to savoy the sauce. 

Every pie is different. Somethings we laugh when we get one because it was made a little too bug for the box but would slide if it was in the next size. It is not a negative to us - just shows that they are working hard to deliver a good product. 

Customer Service is good too. I've never sat down to eat, nor have I opted for delivery however take out is always correct and hot. 

Baking time is quick, which is a bonus as I will normally pick up on the way home. This is one of those go-to places that always gets it right for us.

Simple complaint. I got the wrong pizza.

So.. fast forward a couple of weeks and I order again.

Review: This review really isn't about the quality of the food. They have great pizza and pretty darn good sandwiches.

It's about the business.

I've ordered from them a handful of times.

My 2nd or 3rd order was incorrect and I reached out to GrubHub about it.

Simple complaint. I got the wrong pizza.

So.. fast forward a couple of weeks and I order again.

I get a call from the restaurant.

I am told that they will deliver *this time*, but I have been flagged in their system for canceling orders 4 or 5 times.

Sorry. What the hell? You sent me the wrong pizza *one time*. I complained *one time*. And I am flagged in your system as a multiple time problem customer????

I really like your food, but I'll never eat it again.

Bad form, Angelo and Vitos. Very bad form.

Review: Wowzer .... I just had a spinach and cheese calzone and have to say it's was the best I have ever had . It was a lunch special with a salad and drink . Portions are huge . Plenty of seating and family friendly . Even saw a few arcade games tucked away in the back .

Review: I have been to this place a few times in the past and they are always good. You don't have to wait a long time for your pizza and you can tell the dough is fresh. The crust is always perfect and I just love the pizza here. I never feel overly stuffed after eating and of course, the pizza is always good the next day too! The guys that work there are friendly and there are also games for the kids to play in. They deliver through Yelp as well and the last time I did an order through them, it still did not disappoint!

Review: So I have to say this is by far the best New York Style pizza place in the Dallas area that I have tried, and I have tried a lot. We always take it to go, but I will state that we have a New York Style pizza place a block away and I drive all the way to Independence for this pizza. So pizza gets 5-stars. Why 4 stars on my review? Because after ordering an XL cheese pizza for kids I wanted one slice with veggies on it and they charged me half the price of an entire pizza. They charged me for every pizza topping. A $12 slice of pizza is absolute insanity even with this ridiculous inflation. So I will continue to buy pies for the kids, but will no longer buy myself what I want from there.

Review: Ordered cheese pizza and spaghetti and meatballs to go. Very authentic spaghetti sauce, with many chunks of real tomato. Very tasty. Wonderful spaghetti. Large meatballs and tasty. Cheese pizza with very tasty too. You could tell the pizza sauce was made from scratch, you could see the small chunks of tomato.  Great meal.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Get 2 go pizza here when I'm in the mood for NY pizza. Not always done when promised, sometimes seems a little slow but that's probably because they always seem busy with take out orders. Pretty big area to dine in which we haven't done. Supports locals schools with spirit nights!  Canoli dessert also pretty good, filled to order. Great crust and sauce to pizza ratio.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: This is a well established pizza joint in Plano. Purchased a couple of calzones and a small pizza. 
It's very average in comparison to other pizza restaurants in the area. I believe the Pizza Hut across the street is better. Plenty of area pizza places to choose from. A number of them are less worthy than Angelo & Vito's.

Review: I am certain we ordered the wrong things because everyone is writing comments about how delicious the pizzas are but we unfortunate didn't order pizza! We got the chicken Parmesan, linguini Alfredo, and Italian combo sandwich. The side salads and bread that came with the entrees were very delicious considering they were complimentary. The Alfredo sauce was pretty good but plain for the linguini Alfredo. The chicken Parmesan was huge in portion but the chicken tasted cheap like a huge chicken nugget. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce as well. The Italian combo sandwich was large and great for the value but was doused in Caesar dressing. I also wish the bread was toasted. 

So what I got from this restaurant is it's very affordable and you get a lot of food for your money but the quality is definitely not there. Maybe I will have to try a pizza since I am seeing positive comments about that. 

Restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night and the lighting is a bit dark. So overall, wasn't the best eating experience but that is all.

Review: Can we give them a zero

40 for a sub sub par pizza... go to Walmart buy totinos and save yourself some cash.  Same service and flavor

Drive on, there are many other choices... this is not worth the Stop

Review: First time visit and when we walked into the place it looked small, clean and quiet. Staff was friendly.
We had the mamá mía pizza, half traditional. It was delicious loaded with toppings and cheese. We also ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it too was delicious very authentic. The food was perfect and very affordable. My family and I will definitely be back for more!

Review: Delicious NY style pizza! Very fast, you can order by the slice or you can order a whole pizza. Tastes really authentic and has a lot of flavor, especially if you add the spices that are on the side. I think they had some garlic type spice you can sprinkle on, which was really good. 
It's also really fresh. Highly recommend!

Review: went there because everyone wanted pizza. The only worker was sitting at a table on his phone and once we walked in he went behind the register ready to take our order everytime we spoke to give him our order he repeated the wrong thing and you could barley hear him. the tables where dirty and no one was even in the restaurant. it took thirty minutes for a few pizza slices and a pasta to be done and it wasnt busy the food was kinda good but I wouldnt go again.

Review: Ordered delivery from here for the first time. The pizza came hot. The crust was thin and cooked perfectly. I ordered a cheese pizza with jalapeño. I asked for extra cheese and sauce. The large size was good for 1 person to have an extra meal at a later time. If ordering for two it would be good for 1 meal. If big eaters order a side to have the pizza for more than one meal. The flavor was good. I prefer fresh ingredients so this place met the expectations. Even though I ordered extra sauce the cheese and jalapeño stood out over the sauce. So I can't really say that the sauce was the best I ever had. I like the upscale branding with an affordable price point. When I order pizza again I will order from here.

Review: Tried their pizzas for the first time and sadly I would not order from them again.

Their Mama Mia pizza tasted ok.  Nothing wrong with that one.

Then I took a look at the Margherita pizza and it didn't look right.  Looked like a cheese pizza with diced tomatoes on top, with no red sauce underneath at all.  So it wasn't even a normal cheese pizza.  Tasted bad.

Their wings were just soft and soggy.  

There are many pizza places out there that can do much better.

Review: I've had pizza from Dallas to Frisco and parts in between. So yes, I'm a little crazy about Pizza, maybe order once a week. With that said, I really love Angelo & Vito's, top 5 in the metroplex in my opinion. Don't order it as much as I should, but when I do, it is always outstanding. They don't skimp on toppings, and when you order X cheese, they get it, which is important to me.

Give it a try and you will like it. I just ordered on Door Dash and I live in Frisco, the pizza arrived early and still hot. 

Just my personal opinion, so try it and judge for yourself.

Review: I like everything about this pizza. Perfect crust. Yes, it's a little more than Pizza Hut, dominos, or little Caesar's, but A&Vs is using real cheese and not that fake "cheese food" that the other big chains are using. Try it out, you'll see what I mean.

Review: We came here on a Sunday evening and it was pretty empty. While we were there, most people were getting their orders to go. The menu is vast including pizza, pasta, sandwiches, etc. The price is definitely good and the value is even better. We ordered and then sat with our group and had an entire section to ourselves. There is also a small arcade with some games for the kids. The inside was clean and had that old time pizzeria feel.

We got an Italian combo sandwich, a medium pepperoni pizza, and pasta with alfredo sauce. My sandwich was hot and the bread was toasty. There was a bit too much lettuce for my liking though and the sauce was too sweet and overpowering. I like tasting the meat and other ingredients. The pizza was huge for a medium and was thin, NY style. I was told the pasta was average. We also tried some pepperoni rolls and those were great, along with visually seeing our friend's calzone which was huge!! All in all, a good family place for an outing.

Review: We've had pizza here a couple of times and dinner once. The pizza is thin an cheesy - just like my husband has been searching for! It's delicious. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 star is both times I've had their pizza by the slice, my crust seemed a little overcooked.  The first time it even tasted a little burned. Otherwise a delicious pizza

Review: Been visiting for years when I want NY style pizza. Just the right crunch on the pie with a chewy crust. Our norm is a pie with pepperoni and mushroom plus the cheese-sticks or a cheese pizza. (A giant will feed a hardy family of four.). Always quality with that right amount of cheese that your toppings don't slide but enough to savoy the sauce. 

Every pie is different. Somethings we laugh when we get one because it was made a little too bug for the box but would slide if it was in the next size. It is not a negative to us - just shows that they are working hard to deliver a good product. 

Customer Service is good too. I've never sat down to eat, nor have I opted for delivery however take out is always correct and hot. 

Baking time is quick, which is a bonus as I will normally pick up on the way home. This is one of those go-to places that always gets it right for us.

Every pie is different. Somethings we laugh when we get one because it was made a little too bug for the box but would slide if it was in the next size. It is not a negative to us - just shows that they are working hard to deliver a good product. 

Customer Service is good too. I've never sat down to eat, nor have I opted for delivery however take out is always correct and hot. 

Baking time is quick, which is a bonus as I will normally pick up on the way home. This is one of those go-to places that always gets it right for us.

Review: This review really isn't about the quality of the food. They have great pizza and pretty darn good sandwiches.

It's about the business.

I've ordered from them a handful of times.

My 2nd or 3rd order was incorrect and I reached out to GrubHub about it.

Simple complaint. I got the wrong pizza.

So.. fast forward a couple of weeks and I order again.

I get a call from the restaurant.

I am told that they will deliver *this time*, but I have been flagged in their system for canceling orders 4 or 5 times.

Sorry. What the hell? You sent me the wrong pizza *one time*. I complained *one time*. And I am flagged in your system as a multiple time problem customer????

I really like your food, but I'll never eat it again.

Bad form, Angelo and Vitos. Very bad form.

Review: I have been to this place a few times in the past and they are always good. You don't have to wait a long time for your pizza and you can tell the dough is fresh. The crust is always perfect and I just love the pizza here. I never feel overly stuffed after eating and of course, the pizza is always good the next day too! The guys that work there are friendly and there are also games for the kids to play in. They deliver through Yelp as well and the last time I did an order through them, it still did not disappoint!

Review: So I have to say this is by far the best New York Style pizza place in the Dallas area that I have tried, and I have tried a lot. We always take it to go, but I will state that we have a New York Style pizza place a block away and I drive all the way to Independence for this pizza. So pizza gets 5-stars. Why 4 stars on my review? Because after ordering an XL cheese pizza for kids I wanted one slice with veggies on it and they charged me half the price of an entire pizza. They charged me for every pizza topping. A $12 slice of pizza is absolute insanity even with this ridiculous inflation. So I will continue to buy pies for the kids, but will no longer buy myself what I want from there.

Review: Ordered cheese pizza and spaghetti and meatballs to go. Very authentic spaghetti sauce, with many chunks of real tomato. Very tasty. Wonderful spaghetti. Large meatballs and tasty. Cheese pizza with very tasty too. You could tell the pizza sauce was made from scratch, you could see the small chunks of tomato.  Great meal.

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Get 2 go pizza here when I'm in the mood for NY pizza. Not always done when promised, sometimes seems a little slow but that's probably because they always seem busy with take out orders. Pretty big area to dine in which we haven't done. Supports locals schools with spirit nights!  Canoli dessert also pretty good, filled to order. Great crust and sauce to pizza ratio.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: This is a well established pizza joint in Plano. Purchased a couple of calzones and a small pizza. 
It's very average in comparison to other pizza restaurants in the area. I believe the Pizza Hut across the street is better. Plenty of area pizza places to choose from. A number of them are less worthy than Angelo & Vito's.

Review: I am certain we ordered the wrong things because everyone is writing comments about how delicious the pizzas are but we unfortunate didn't order pizza! We got the chicken Parmesan, linguini Alfredo, and Italian combo sandwich. The side salads and bread that came with the entrees were very delicious considering they were complimentary. The Alfredo sauce was pretty good but plain for the linguini Alfredo. The chicken Parmesan was huge in portion but the chicken tasted cheap like a huge chicken nugget. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce as well. The Italian combo sandwich was large and great for the value but was doused in Caesar dressing. I also wish the bread was toasted. 

So what I got from this restaurant is it's very affordable and you get a lot of food for your money but the quality is definitely not there. Maybe I will have to try a pizza since I am seeing positive comments about that. 

Restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night and the lighting is a bit dark. So overall, wasn't the best eating experience but that is all.

40 for a sub sub par pizza... go to Walmart buy totinos and save yourself some cash.  Same service and flavor

Drive on, there are many other choices... this is not worth the Stop

Review: First time visit and when we walked into the place it looked small, clean and quiet. Staff was friendly.
We had the mamá mía pizza, half traditional. It was delicious loaded with toppings and cheese. We also ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it too was delicious very authentic. The food was perfect and very affordable. My family and I will definitely be back for more!

Review: Delicious NY style pizza! Very fast, you can order by the slice or you can order a whole pizza. Tastes really authentic and has a lot of flavor, especially if you add the spices that are on the side. I think they had some garlic type spice you can sprinkle on, which was really good. 
It's also really fresh. Highly recommend!

Review: went there because everyone wanted pizza. The only worker was sitting at a table on his phone and once we walked in he went behind the register ready to take our order everytime we spoke to give him our order he repeated the wrong thing and you could barley hear him. the tables where dirty and no one was even in the restaurant. it took thirty minutes for a few pizza slices and a pasta to be done and it wasnt busy the food was kinda good but I wouldnt go again.

Review: Ordered delivery from here for the first time. The pizza came hot. The crust was thin and cooked perfectly. I ordered a cheese pizza with jalapeño. I asked for extra cheese and sauce. The large size was good for 1 person to have an extra meal at a later time. If ordering for two it would be good for 1 meal. If big eaters order a side to have the pizza for more than one meal. The flavor was good. I prefer fresh ingredients so this place met the expectations. Even though I ordered extra sauce the cheese and jalapeño stood out over the sauce. So I can't really say that the sauce was the best I ever had. I like the upscale branding with an affordable price point. When I order pizza again I will order from here.

Review: Tried their pizzas for the first time and sadly I would not order from them again.

Their Mama Mia pizza tasted ok.  Nothing wrong with that one.

Then I took a look at the Margherita pizza and it didn't look right.  Looked like a cheese pizza with diced tomatoes on top, with no red sauce underneath at all.  So it wasn't even a normal cheese pizza.  Tasted bad.

Their wings were just soft and soggy.  

There are many pizza places out there that can do much better.

Review: I've had pizza from Dallas to Frisco and parts in between. So yes, I'm a little crazy about Pizza, maybe order once a week. With that said, I really love Angelo & Vito's, top 5 in the metroplex in my opinion. Don't order it as much as I should, but when I do, it is always outstanding. They don't skimp on toppings, and when you order X cheese, they get it, which is important to me.

Give it a try and you will like it. I just ordered on Door Dash and I live in Frisco, the pizza arrived early and still hot. 

Just my personal opinion, so try it and judge for yourself.

Review: I like everything about this pizza. Perfect crust. Yes, it's a little more than Pizza Hut, dominos, or little Caesar's, but A&Vs is using real cheese and not that fake "cheese food" that the other big chains are using. Try it out, you'll see what I mean.

Review: We came here on a Sunday evening and it was pretty empty. While we were there, most people were getting their orders to go. The menu is vast including pizza, pasta, sandwiches, etc. The price is definitely good and the value is even better. We ordered and then sat with our group and had an entire section to ourselves. There is also a small arcade with some games for the kids. The inside was clean and had that old time pizzeria feel.

We got an Italian combo sandwich, a medium pepperoni pizza, and pasta with alfredo sauce. My sandwich was hot and the bread was toasty. There was a bit too much lettuce for my liking though and the sauce was too sweet and overpowering. I like tasting the meat and other ingredients. The pizza was huge for a medium and was thin, NY style. I was told the pasta was average. We also tried some pepperoni rolls and those were great, along with visually seeing our friend's calzone which was huge!! All in all, a good family place for an outing.

Review: We've had pizza here a couple of times and dinner once. The pizza is thin an cheesy - just like my husband has been searching for! It's delicious. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 star is both times I've had their pizza by the slice, my crust seemed a little overcooked.  The first time it even tasted a little burned. Otherwise a delicious pizza

Review: First time here and it was good! We got a large cheese pizza, it was fresh/hot and very flavorful. Due to COVID you will need to call them when you arrive, they will tell you where to stand in front and they will bring the food out to you.

Review: Best pizza joint hands down, best bang for your buck. Definitely going to comeback again this place left a good impression on me. Next time I'll post a picture of the food before I eat it all.

Review: Been visiting for years when I want NY style pizza. Just the right crunch on the pie with a chewy crust. Our norm is a pie with pepperoni and mushroom plus the cheese-sticks or a cheese pizza. (A giant will feed a hardy family of four.). Always quality with that right amount of cheese that your toppings don't slide but enough to savoy the sauce. 

Every pie is different. Somethings we laugh when we get one because it was made a little too bug for the box but would slide if it was in the next size. It is not a negative to us - just shows that they are working hard to deliver a good product. 

Customer Service is good too. I've never sat down to eat, nor have I opted for delivery however take out is always correct and hot. 

Baking time is quick, which is a bonus as I will normally pick up on the way home. This is one of those go-to places that always gets it right for us.

Review: My favorite pizza place. Approved by my children and my one one year old granddaughter who would not let go of the remains of her crust even though she was full. Two thumbs up

Review: This review really isn't about the quality of the food. They have great pizza and pretty darn good sandwiches.

It's about the business.

I've ordered from them a handful of times.

My 2nd or 3rd order was incorrect and I reached out to GrubHub about it.

Simple complaint. I got the wrong pizza.

So.. fast forward a couple of weeks and I order again.

I get a call from the restaurant.

I am told that they will deliver *this time*, but I have been flagged in their system for canceling orders 4 or 5 times.

Sorry. What the hell? You sent me the wrong pizza *one time*. I complained *one time*. And I am flagged in your system as a multiple time problem customer????

I really like your food, but I'll never eat it again.

Bad form, Angelo and Vitos. Very bad form.

Review: Wowzer .... I just had a spinach and cheese calzone and have to say it's was the best I have ever had . It was a lunch special with a salad and drink . Portions are huge . Plenty of seating and family friendly . Even saw a few arcade games tucked away in the back .

Review: I have been to this place a few times in the past and they are always good. You don't have to wait a long time for your pizza and you can tell the dough is fresh. The crust is always perfect and I just love the pizza here. I never feel overly stuffed after eating and of course, the pizza is always good the next day too! The guys that work there are friendly and there are also games for the kids to play in. They deliver through Yelp as well and the last time I did an order through them, it still did not disappoint!
