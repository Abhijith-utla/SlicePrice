Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

3 stars
Nice dining environment with good service but unfortunately the dishes we ordered were just not up to par in my opinion...

We got the soup dumplings, lamb with cumin sauce, and basil eggplant. The soup dumplings were definitely the best part of the meal as they were juicy and flavorful; however, both of the other dishes were severely under salted. While the flavors were decent, they could have been easily elevated if there was just more salt added!

5 stars
casual homey restaurant with a wide menu of typical chinese dishes. the serving size are huge and def worth the price. 

everything we had delicious, i always love ordering bok choy and green beans to help with the mala, highly recommend. also love the la si ji and mapo tofu. 

service is extremely friendly!!

4 stars
We have to order by scanning a QR code at our table. After the order is placed, the host will double check our order. There was no clear indication if the order came with rice, so we ordered two bowls of rice and ended up with a large container of rice. Having to pay for rice was always a deterrent for me. The food was good though. I just prefer ordering with paper menu and talking to someone. We did see some people bring drinks, so it looks like it is byob.

I really enjoyed this place as it serves great, authentic Sichuan Chinese food! 

I came here for dinner with some friends and we got the Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), dry fried string beans (干煸四季豆), twice cooked pork (回锅肉), farm house beef (农家小炒牛), and deep fried fish with roasted chili (重庆辣子鱼). The taste and quality of all the dishes were amazing and I could recommend all of these dishes to anyone. My favorite dish was the deep fried fish with roasted chili, it's not crazy spicy but the fish was fried perfectly on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  

The interior is pretty spacious with plenty of seating and the restaurant was not super busy when we went. They have a few tables that can fit big parties, like 8+ people. You order by scanning the QR code on the table and ordering the dishes off your phone. The service was pretty quick, but we did have to wait a while for the deep fried fish to come out.

Overall great restaurant, and I would highly recommend for anyone craving Sichuan Chinese food. Looking forward to coming here again.

5 stars
All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

4 stars
Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

Speed: we came at 5:30 for an early dinner, no crowd and we for our food quickly 

Service: not bad! We came in before the crowd so it wasn't bad as the reviews say so best to come in when there's no crowd. 

Tables and Decor:  accommodates small and large groups. Decor is bare, clean space, noisy with no sound absorption materials. We are here to eat so you probably wouldn't notice this.

5 stars
All dishes were excellent.  We go here 2x a month.   Satisfied every time!  The weight staff is very efficient and friendly. Even the rice is delicious.

This is Sichuan Folk's new location!  We came by on a Wednesday for lunch around 12:30 pm and it was pretty busy with only a few open tables. The new location is pretty spacious with plenty of tables for both average parties and large groups.  Luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

5 stars
My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

5 stars
I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

3 stars
** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

3 stars
Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

5 stars
My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

5 stars
Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

5 stars
Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

4 stars
Friendly service! Easy ordering  via QR code. Clean establishment. Good for small or big groups. Good for family style.

5 stars
Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

1 stars
Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

5 stars
Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

5 stars
When I came to this restaurant. Every single table was full. Despite this, we were seated as a walk in within 20 minutes. The table turnover time was less than 1 minute.

Immediately we were greeted and had drinks. We ordered and the waiter came by to confirm. 

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

5 stars
Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

1 stars
Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

4 stars
Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

4 stars
The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

4 stars
Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

5 stars
Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

5 stars
I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

5 stars
I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

3 stars
Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

4 stars
Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

1 stars
DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

4 stars
Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).

Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol.

The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

This is Sichuan Folk's new location!  We came by on a Wednesday for lunch around 12:30 pm and it was pretty busy with only a few open tables. The new location is pretty spacious with plenty of tables for both average parties and large groups.  Luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

5 stars
I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

3 stars
** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

3 stars
Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

5 stars
My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

5 stars
Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

5 stars
Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

4 stars
Friendly service! Easy ordering  via QR code. Clean establishment. Good for small or big groups. Good for family style.

Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

1 stars
Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

5 stars
Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

5 stars
When I came to this restaurant. Every single table was full. Despite this, we were seated as a walk in within 20 minutes. The table turnover time was less than 1 minute.

Immediately we were greeted and had drinks. We ordered and the waiter came by to confirm. 

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

5 stars
Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

1 stars
Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

4 stars
Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

4 stars
The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

4 stars
Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

5 stars
Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

5 stars
I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

5 stars
I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

3 stars
Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

4 stars
Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

4 stars
Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4 stars
4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).

5 stars
Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

3 stars
Nice dining environment with good service but unfortunately the dishes we ordered were just not up to par in my opinion...

We got the soup dumplings, lamb with cumin sauce, and basil eggplant. The soup dumplings were definitely the best part of the meal as they were juicy and flavorful; however, both of the other dishes were severely under salted. While the flavors were decent, they could have been easily elevated if there was just more salt added!

5 stars
casual homey restaurant with a wide menu of typical chinese dishes. the serving size are huge and def worth the price. 

everything we had delicious, i always love ordering bok choy and green beans to help with the mala, highly recommend. also love the la si ji and mapo tofu. 

service is extremely friendly!!

4 stars
We have to order by scanning a QR code at our table. After the order is placed, the host will double check our order. There was no clear indication if the order came with rice, so we ordered two bowls of rice and ended up with a large container of rice. Having to pay for rice was always a deterrent for me. The food was good though. I just prefer ordering with paper menu and talking to someone. We did see some people bring drinks, so it looks like it is byob.

5 stars
I really enjoyed this place as it serves great, authentic Sichuan Chinese food! 

I came here for dinner with some friends and we got the Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), dry fried string beans (干煸四季豆), twice cooked pork (回锅肉), farm house beef (农家小炒牛), and deep fried fish with roasted chili (重庆辣子鱼). The taste and quality of all the dishes were amazing and I could recommend all of these dishes to anyone. My favorite dish was the deep fried fish with roasted chili, it's not crazy spicy but the fish was fried perfectly on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  

The interior is pretty spacious with plenty of seating and the restaurant was not super busy when we went. They have a few tables that can fit big parties, like 8+ people. You order by scanning the QR code on the table and ordering the dishes off your phone. The service was pretty quick, but we did have to wait a while for the deep fried fish to come out.

Overall great restaurant, and I would highly recommend for anyone craving Sichuan Chinese food. Looking forward to coming here again.

5 stars
All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

4 stars
Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

Speed: we came at 5:30 for an early dinner, no crowd and we for our food quickly 

Service: not bad! We came in before the crowd so it wasn't bad as the reviews say so best to come in when there's no crowd. 

Tables and Decor:  accommodates small and large groups. Decor is bare, clean space, noisy with no sound absorption materials. We are here to eat so you probably wouldn't notice this.

All dishes were excellent.  We go here 2x a month.   Satisfied every time!  The weight staff is very efficient and friendly. Even the rice is delicious.

Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

5 stars
Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

5 stars
Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

Friendly service! Easy ordering  via QR code. Clean establishment. Good for small or big groups. Good for family style.

Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

1 stars
Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

5 stars
Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

5 stars
When I came to this restaurant. Every single table was full. Despite this, we were seated as a walk in within 20 minutes. The table turnover time was less than 1 minute.

Immediately we were greeted and had drinks. We ordered and the waiter came by to confirm. 

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

5 stars
Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

1 stars
Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

4 stars
Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

4 stars
The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

4 stars
Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

5 stars
Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

5 stars
I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

5 stars
So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

5 stars
I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

3 stars
Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

4 stars
Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

1 stars
DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

4 stars
Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4 stars
4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).

5 stars
Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

3 stars
Nice dining environment with good service but unfortunately the dishes we ordered were just not up to par in my opinion...

We got the soup dumplings, lamb with cumin sauce, and basil eggplant. The soup dumplings were definitely the best part of the meal as they were juicy and flavorful; however, both of the other dishes were severely under salted. While the flavors were decent, they could have been easily elevated if there was just more salt added!

5 stars
casual homey restaurant with a wide menu of typical chinese dishes. the serving size are huge and def worth the price. 

everything we had delicious, i always love ordering bok choy and green beans to help with the mala, highly recommend. also love the la si ji and mapo tofu. 

service is extremely friendly!!

4 stars
We have to order by scanning a QR code at our table. After the order is placed, the host will double check our order. There was no clear indication if the order came with rice, so we ordered two bowls of rice and ended up with a large container of rice. Having to pay for rice was always a deterrent for me. The food was good though. I just prefer ordering with paper menu and talking to someone. We did see some people bring drinks, so it looks like it is byob.

5 stars
I really enjoyed this place as it serves great, authentic Sichuan Chinese food! 

I came here for dinner with some friends and we got the Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), dry fried string beans (干煸四季豆), twice cooked pork (回锅肉), farm house beef (农家小炒牛), and deep fried fish with roasted chili (重庆辣子鱼). The taste and quality of all the dishes were amazing and I could recommend all of these dishes to anyone. My favorite dish was the deep fried fish with roasted chili, it's not crazy spicy but the fish was fried perfectly on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  

The interior is pretty spacious with plenty of seating and the restaurant was not super busy when we went. They have a few tables that can fit big parties, like 8+ people. You order by scanning the QR code on the table and ordering the dishes off your phone. The service was pretty quick, but we did have to wait a while for the deep fried fish to come out.

Overall great restaurant, and I would highly recommend for anyone craving Sichuan Chinese food. Looking forward to coming here again.

5 stars
All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

4 stars
Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

Speed: we came at 5:30 for an early dinner, no crowd and we for our food quickly 

Service: not bad! We came in before the crowd so it wasn't bad as the reviews say so best to come in when there's no crowd. 

Tables and Decor:  accommodates small and large groups. Decor is bare, clean space, noisy with no sound absorption materials. We are here to eat so you probably wouldn't notice this.

5 stars
All dishes were excellent.  We go here 2x a month.   Satisfied every time!  The weight staff is very efficient and friendly. Even the rice is delicious.

This is Sichuan Folk's new location!  We came by on a Wednesday for lunch around 12:30 pm and it was pretty busy with only a few open tables. The new location is pretty spacious with plenty of tables for both average parties and large groups.  Luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

Food: 5/5

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

5 stars
My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

5 stars
I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

3 stars
** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

5 stars
I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

3 stars
Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

4 stars
Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

1 stars
DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

4 stars
Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4 stars
4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).

5 stars
Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

3 stars
Nice dining environment with good service but unfortunately the dishes we ordered were just not up to par in my opinion...

We got the soup dumplings, lamb with cumin sauce, and basil eggplant. The soup dumplings were definitely the best part of the meal as they were juicy and flavorful; however, both of the other dishes were severely under salted. While the flavors were decent, they could have been easily elevated if there was just more salt added!

5 stars
casual homey restaurant with a wide menu of typical chinese dishes. the serving size are huge and def worth the price. 

everything we had delicious, i always love ordering bok choy and green beans to help with the mala, highly recommend. also love the la si ji and mapo tofu. 

service is extremely friendly!!

4 stars
We have to order by scanning a QR code at our table. After the order is placed, the host will double check our order. There was no clear indication if the order came with rice, so we ordered two bowls of rice and ended up with a large container of rice. Having to pay for rice was always a deterrent for me. The food was good though. I just prefer ordering with paper menu and talking to someone. We did see some people bring drinks, so it looks like it is byob.

5 stars
I really enjoyed this place as it serves great, authentic Sichuan Chinese food! 

I came here for dinner with some friends and we got the Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), dry fried string beans (干煸四季豆), twice cooked pork (回锅肉), farm house beef (农家小炒牛), and deep fried fish with roasted chili (重庆辣子鱼). The taste and quality of all the dishes were amazing and I could recommend all of these dishes to anyone. My favorite dish was the deep fried fish with roasted chili, it's not crazy spicy but the fish was fried perfectly on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  

The interior is pretty spacious with plenty of seating and the restaurant was not super busy when we went. They have a few tables that can fit big parties, like 8+ people. You order by scanning the QR code on the table and ordering the dishes off your phone. The service was pretty quick, but we did have to wait a while for the deep fried fish to come out.

Overall great restaurant, and I would highly recommend for anyone craving Sichuan Chinese food. Looking forward to coming here again.

5 stars
All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

4 stars
Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

Speed: we came at 5:30 for an early dinner, no crowd and we for our food quickly 

Service: not bad! We came in before the crowd so it wasn't bad as the reviews say so best to come in when there's no crowd. 

Tables and Decor:  accommodates small and large groups. Decor is bare, clean space, noisy with no sound absorption materials. We are here to eat so you probably wouldn't notice this.

5 stars
All dishes were excellent.  We go here 2x a month.   Satisfied every time!  The weight staff is very efficient and friendly. Even the rice is delicious.

4 stars
This is Sichuan Folk's new location!  We came by on a Wednesday for lunch around 12:30 pm and it was pretty busy with only a few open tables. The new location is pretty spacious with plenty of tables for both average parties and large groups.  Luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

5 stars
My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

5 stars
I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

3 stars
** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

3 stars
Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

5 stars
My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor

I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

4 stars
Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

1 stars
DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

4 stars
Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4 stars
4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).

5 stars
Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

3 stars
Nice dining environment with good service but unfortunately the dishes we ordered were just not up to par in my opinion...

We got the soup dumplings, lamb with cumin sauce, and basil eggplant. The soup dumplings were definitely the best part of the meal as they were juicy and flavorful; however, both of the other dishes were severely under salted. While the flavors were decent, they could have been easily elevated if there was just more salt added!

5 stars
casual homey restaurant with a wide menu of typical chinese dishes. the serving size are huge and def worth the price. 

everything we had delicious, i always love ordering bok choy and green beans to help with the mala, highly recommend. also love the la si ji and mapo tofu. 

service is extremely friendly!!

4 stars
We have to order by scanning a QR code at our table. After the order is placed, the host will double check our order. There was no clear indication if the order came with rice, so we ordered two bowls of rice and ended up with a large container of rice. Having to pay for rice was always a deterrent for me. The food was good though. I just prefer ordering with paper menu and talking to someone. We did see some people bring drinks, so it looks like it is byob.

5 stars
I really enjoyed this place as it serves great, authentic Sichuan Chinese food! 

I came here for dinner with some friends and we got the Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), dry fried string beans (干煸四季豆), twice cooked pork (回锅肉), farm house beef (农家小炒牛), and deep fried fish with roasted chili (重庆辣子鱼). The taste and quality of all the dishes were amazing and I could recommend all of these dishes to anyone. My favorite dish was the deep fried fish with roasted chili, it's not crazy spicy but the fish was fried perfectly on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  

The interior is pretty spacious with plenty of seating and the restaurant was not super busy when we went. They have a few tables that can fit big parties, like 8+ people. You order by scanning the QR code on the table and ordering the dishes off your phone. The service was pretty quick, but we did have to wait a while for the deep fried fish to come out.

Overall great restaurant, and I would highly recommend for anyone craving Sichuan Chinese food. Looking forward to coming here again.

5 stars
All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

4 stars
Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

Speed: we came at 5:30 for an early dinner, no crowd and we for our food quickly 

Service: not bad! We came in before the crowd so it wasn't bad as the reviews say so best to come in when there's no crowd. 

Tables and Decor:  accommodates small and large groups. Decor is bare, clean space, noisy with no sound absorption materials. We are here to eat so you probably wouldn't notice this.

5 stars
All dishes were excellent.  We go here 2x a month.   Satisfied every time!  The weight staff is very efficient and friendly. Even the rice is delicious.

4 stars
This is Sichuan Folk's new location!  We came by on a Wednesday for lunch around 12:30 pm and it was pretty busy with only a few open tables. The new location is pretty spacious with plenty of tables for both average parties and large groups.  Luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

Food: 5/5

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

5 stars
My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

5 stars
I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

3 stars
** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

3 stars
Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

5 stars
My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

5 stars
Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

5 stars
Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

Friendly service! Easy ordering  via QR code. Clean establishment. Good for small or big groups. Good for family style.

Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

1 stars
Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

5 stars
Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

5 stars
When I came to this restaurant. Every single table was full. Despite this, we were seated as a walk in within 20 minutes. The table turnover time was less than 1 minute.

Immediately we were greeted and had drinks. We ordered and the waiter came by to confirm. 

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

5 stars
Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

1 stars
Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

4 stars
Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

4 stars
The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

4 stars
Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

5 stars
Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).

5 stars
Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

3 stars
Nice dining environment with good service but unfortunately the dishes we ordered were just not up to par in my opinion...

We got the soup dumplings, lamb with cumin sauce, and basil eggplant. The soup dumplings were definitely the best part of the meal as they were juicy and flavorful; however, both of the other dishes were severely under salted. While the flavors were decent, they could have been easily elevated if there was just more salt added!

5 stars
casual homey restaurant with a wide menu of typical chinese dishes. the serving size are huge and def worth the price. 

everything we had delicious, i always love ordering bok choy and green beans to help with the mala, highly recommend. also love the la si ji and mapo tofu. 

service is extremely friendly!!

4 stars
We have to order by scanning a QR code at our table. After the order is placed, the host will double check our order. There was no clear indication if the order came with rice, so we ordered two bowls of rice and ended up with a large container of rice. Having to pay for rice was always a deterrent for me. The food was good though. I just prefer ordering with paper menu and talking to someone. We did see some people bring drinks, so it looks like it is byob.

5 stars
I really enjoyed this place as it serves great, authentic Sichuan Chinese food! 

I came here for dinner with some friends and we got the Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), dry fried string beans (干煸四季豆), twice cooked pork (回锅肉), farm house beef (农家小炒牛), and deep fried fish with roasted chili (重庆辣子鱼). The taste and quality of all the dishes were amazing and I could recommend all of these dishes to anyone. My favorite dish was the deep fried fish with roasted chili, it's not crazy spicy but the fish was fried perfectly on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  

The interior is pretty spacious with plenty of seating and the restaurant was not super busy when we went. They have a few tables that can fit big parties, like 8+ people. You order by scanning the QR code on the table and ordering the dishes off your phone. The service was pretty quick, but we did have to wait a while for the deep fried fish to come out.

Overall great restaurant, and I would highly recommend for anyone craving Sichuan Chinese food. Looking forward to coming here again.

5 stars
All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

4 stars
Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

Speed: we came at 5:30 for an early dinner, no crowd and we for our food quickly 

Service: not bad! We came in before the crowd so it wasn't bad as the reviews say so best to come in when there's no crowd. 

Tables and Decor:  accommodates small and large groups. Decor is bare, clean space, noisy with no sound absorption materials. We are here to eat so you probably wouldn't notice this.

5 stars
All dishes were excellent.  We go here 2x a month.   Satisfied every time!  The weight staff is very efficient and friendly. Even the rice is delicious.

4 stars
This is Sichuan Folk's new location!  We came by on a Wednesday for lunch around 12:30 pm and it was pretty busy with only a few open tables. The new location is pretty spacious with plenty of tables for both average parties and large groups.  Luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

5 stars
My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

5 stars
I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

3 stars
** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

3 stars
Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

5 stars
My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

5 stars
Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

5 stars
Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

4 stars
Friendly service! Easy ordering  via QR code. Clean establishment. Good for small or big groups. Good for family style.

Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

1 stars
Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

5 stars
Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

5 stars
When I came to this restaurant. Every single table was full. Despite this, we were seated as a walk in within 20 minutes. The table turnover time was less than 1 minute.

Immediately we were greeted and had drinks. We ordered and the waiter came by to confirm. 

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

5 stars
Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

1 stars
Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

4 stars
Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

4 stars
The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

4 stars
Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

5 stars
Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

5 stars
I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).

5 stars
Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

3 stars
Nice dining environment with good service but unfortunately the dishes we ordered were just not up to par in my opinion...

We got the soup dumplings, lamb with cumin sauce, and basil eggplant. The soup dumplings were definitely the best part of the meal as they were juicy and flavorful; however, both of the other dishes were severely under salted. While the flavors were decent, they could have been easily elevated if there was just more salt added!

5 stars
casual homey restaurant with a wide menu of typical chinese dishes. the serving size are huge and def worth the price. 

everything we had delicious, i always love ordering bok choy and green beans to help with the mala, highly recommend. also love the la si ji and mapo tofu. 

service is extremely friendly!!

4 stars
We have to order by scanning a QR code at our table. After the order is placed, the host will double check our order. There was no clear indication if the order came with rice, so we ordered two bowls of rice and ended up with a large container of rice. Having to pay for rice was always a deterrent for me. The food was good though. I just prefer ordering with paper menu and talking to someone. We did see some people bring drinks, so it looks like it is byob.

5 stars
I really enjoyed this place as it serves great, authentic Sichuan Chinese food! 

I came here for dinner with some friends and we got the Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), dry fried string beans (干煸四季豆), twice cooked pork (回锅肉), farm house beef (农家小炒牛), and deep fried fish with roasted chili (重庆辣子鱼). The taste and quality of all the dishes were amazing and I could recommend all of these dishes to anyone. My favorite dish was the deep fried fish with roasted chili, it's not crazy spicy but the fish was fried perfectly on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  

The interior is pretty spacious with plenty of seating and the restaurant was not super busy when we went. They have a few tables that can fit big parties, like 8+ people. You order by scanning the QR code on the table and ordering the dishes off your phone. The service was pretty quick, but we did have to wait a while for the deep fried fish to come out.

Overall great restaurant, and I would highly recommend for anyone craving Sichuan Chinese food. Looking forward to coming here again.

5 stars
All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

4 stars
Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

Speed: we came at 5:30 for an early dinner, no crowd and we for our food quickly 

Service: not bad! We came in before the crowd so it wasn't bad as the reviews say so best to come in when there's no crowd. 

Tables and Decor:  accommodates small and large groups. Decor is bare, clean space, noisy with no sound absorption materials. We are here to eat so you probably wouldn't notice this.

5 stars
All dishes were excellent.  We go here 2x a month.   Satisfied every time!  The weight staff is very efficient and friendly. Even the rice is delicious.

4 stars
This is Sichuan Folk's new location!  We came by on a Wednesday for lunch around 12:30 pm and it was pretty busy with only a few open tables. The new location is pretty spacious with plenty of tables for both average parties and large groups.  Luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

5 stars
My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

5 stars
I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

3 stars
** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

3 stars
Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

5 stars
My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

5 stars
Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

5 stars
Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

4 stars
Friendly service! Easy ordering  via QR code. Clean establishment. Good for small or big groups. Good for family style.

5 stars
Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

1 stars
Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

5 stars
Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

5 stars
When I came to this restaurant. Every single table was full. Despite this, we were seated as a walk in within 20 minutes. The table turnover time was less than 1 minute.

Immediately we were greeted and had drinks. We ordered and the waiter came by to confirm. 

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

5 stars
Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

1 stars
Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

4 stars
Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

4 stars
The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

4 stars
Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

5 stars
Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

5 stars
I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

5 stars
I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

3 stars
Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

4 stars
Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

1 stars
DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

4 stars
Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about.

All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed. 

Price: pretty good! 6 orders for $70 and the servings were good

Speed: we came at 5:30 for an early dinner, no crowd and we for our food quickly 

Service: not bad! We came in before the crowd so it wasn't bad as the reviews say so best to come in when there's no crowd. 

Tables and Decor:  accommodates small and large groups. Decor is bare, clean space, noisy with no sound absorption materials. We are here to eat so you probably wouldn't notice this.

All dishes were excellent.  We go here 2x a month.   Satisfied every time!  The weight staff is very efficient and friendly. Even the rice is delicious.

This is Sichuan Folk's new location!  We came by on a Wednesday for lunch around 12:30 pm and it was pretty busy with only a few open tables. The new location is pretty spacious with plenty of tables for both average parties and large groups.  Luckily we were able to be seated immediately. Their menu and ordering system are all digital which can be accessed by scanning the QR code at the table.

They serve authentic Szechuan cuisine. While they have a whole separate section on their menu for Americanized Chinese food, their specialty are their Szechuan dishes. 

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

5 stars
My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

5 stars
I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

3 stars
** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

3 stars
Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

5 stars
My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

5 stars
Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

5 stars
Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

4 stars
Friendly service! Easy ordering  via QR code. Clean establishment. Good for small or big groups. Good for family style.

Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

1 stars
Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

5 stars
Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

5 stars
When I came to this restaurant. Every single table was full. Despite this, we were seated as a walk in within 20 minutes. The table turnover time was less than 1 minute.

Immediately we were greeted and had drinks. We ordered and the waiter came by to confirm. 

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

5 stars
Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

1 stars
Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

4 stars
Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

4 stars
The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

4 stars
Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

5 stars
Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

5 stars
I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

3 stars
Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

4 stars
Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

4 stars
Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).

5 stars
Finally found my favorite Sichuan restaurant in DFW! All of the food that we ordered were great. 

I went there twice already in a week. My favorite dish is their fish dish. I don't remember the exact name but this fish dish was delicious  - not too oily or spicy but great texture and flavor. Snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked too. 

Fried spicy chicken cube, salt & pepper prok ribs, and mapo tofu are some other dishes that I ordered and all of them were great. I want to go back in the near future to try other dishes too!

3 stars
Nice dining environment with good service but unfortunately the dishes we ordered were just not up to par in my opinion...

We got the soup dumplings, lamb with cumin sauce, and basil eggplant. The soup dumplings were definitely the best part of the meal as they were juicy and flavorful; however, both of the other dishes were severely under salted. While the flavors were decent, they could have been easily elevated if there was just more salt added!

5 stars
casual homey restaurant with a wide menu of typical chinese dishes. the serving size are huge and def worth the price. 

everything we had delicious, i always love ordering bok choy and green beans to help with the mala, highly recommend. also love the la si ji and mapo tofu. 

service is extremely friendly!!

4 stars
We have to order by scanning a QR code at our table. After the order is placed, the host will double check our order. There was no clear indication if the order came with rice, so we ordered two bowls of rice and ended up with a large container of rice. Having to pay for rice was always a deterrent for me. The food was good though. I just prefer ordering with paper menu and talking to someone. We did see some people bring drinks, so it looks like it is byob.

5 stars
I really enjoyed this place as it serves great, authentic Sichuan Chinese food! 

I came here for dinner with some friends and we got the Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), dry fried string beans (干煸四季豆), twice cooked pork (回锅肉), farm house beef (农家小炒牛), and deep fried fish with roasted chili (重庆辣子鱼). The taste and quality of all the dishes were amazing and I could recommend all of these dishes to anyone. My favorite dish was the deep fried fish with roasted chili, it's not crazy spicy but the fish was fried perfectly on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  

The interior is pretty spacious with plenty of seating and the restaurant was not super busy when we went. They have a few tables that can fit big parties, like 8+ people. You order by scanning the QR code on the table and ordering the dishes off your phone. The service was pretty quick, but we did have to wait a while for the deep fried fish to come out.

Overall great restaurant, and I would highly recommend for anyone craving Sichuan Chinese food. Looking forward to coming here again.

All the food is naturally spicy and extremely delicious. 

This is authentic Sichuan food served in a modern and appropriately brightly-lit dining room with very kind wait staff. 

The lamb in the lamb with cumin sauce was very tender and my wife said the flavor in the cumin sauce reminded her of the flavor of hot dog chili and I can't unhear it now lol. She's absolutely right but I still loved it. The dry fried green beans were salty, perfectly al dente, and super garlicky. The soup dumplings were of a flavor profile I never had before, unique, and perhaps a family recipe, but either way I can't wait to go back and have more. My wife's dan dan noodles had big punchy flavor and came out piping hot. 

I want to try so much more of this menu.

Chinese restaurant, yes another one, as they are the most flavorful and flexible when you can't have garlic or onion. What I ate:
Salt and pepper tofu - yum!
Bitter melon with black bean sauce 
Homestyle Tofu
Shredded potato with vinegar sauce
Basil eggplant 
Hot and sour soup

Probably need additional greens.

Flavors All good! Another 'authentic Chinese'  restaurant. Not your typical Chinese American eatery and a lot of Chinese came in as the night progressed.

We ordered minced beef with egg white soup (西湖牛肉羹), A vegetable (A菜）, hibachi frog (铁板牛蛙), spicy chicken with chili sauce (椒麻鸡). The rice needs to be ordered separately.  We wanted to try their non-spicy dishes today.  Warm water is available upon request, but the water tasted weird (probably tap). Some dishes have to be pre-ordered by calling ahead given limited supply and how long it takes to cook.

The food came out pretty fast. The soup came out first steaming hot. Wasn't too salty, not much meat, plenty of mushrooms and egg whites. The hibachi frog looked amazing; the meat was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and is served on a hot plate. There's just a teensy bit of spice to add flavor but not enough to burn.  The chicken is a cold dish and was very numbing. Some of the meat was a bit overcooked, but the meat soaking in the sauce was tender. The chicken has jalapeños sitting on top but the dish isn't spicy (as long as you don't eat the jalapeños). The A vegetables were alright, not too salty. 

Everything was pretty good. None of it was spicy. Despite that I've had their spicy food for takeout before and if you can handle it, I highly recommend their spicy dishes over non-spicy ones.

This is my favorite Sichuan place, and it's high rates are definitely deserved. Get the deep fried chicken with roasted chilis - it is a delicious balance of mala, spiced, and a tiny bit sweet, and it'll be the most addictive thing you crave over and over. We also typically get the green beans, some other veggies (like snow pea leaves of eggplant), and the spicy boiled fish (shui zhu yu) which is so deliciously fragrant and has a beautifully tender flaky white fish.

This area is growing and has a lot of yummy restaurants in the area, both in this plaza and the one across the street - but this is our standout favorite.

My uncle took us here for a quick lunch before the solar eclipse. The lunch specials here are way too generous: less than ten dollars for a full sized dish. For three people, it meant we paid $30 to get three full sized dishes to share! I assumed it was going to be served with rice on the same plate so we'd each have our own, but it was served family style.
The food also came out quite quickly, which was excellent for us and the dog who was waiting for us :)

I wish this restaurant existed near where I live now, because it would 100% be a go to for lunch and takeout.

I'm shocked that I have not previously written a review for this place! It's my favorite Sichuan place in the Dallas area, and we are almost always willing to make the long drive to eat here. We always order the chili fried chicken (boneless), the fish in spicy chili sauce (水煮魚), and green beans when we're here. We've also tried the eggplant and a few other veggies, but we are definitely creatures of habit with our favorite dishes. The chicken is soooo good. Perfectly crispy and savory. The spice does build over time, but it's not overwhelming. The fish comes with really generous portions and cabbage and celery, so we always end up taking some home and eating the leftovers with rice. The green beans are so tasty and probably our favorite green beans out of the Chinese restaurants in Dallas.

** New interior and good service but dishes were way too salty and heavy. Could have potential if the adjustments are made by the kitchen.

The wife and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing all the new restaurants opening up in the plaza. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy fish, and string beans.

Overall the portions were decently generous and the flavor was good - just way too heavy and salty across all dishes. We asked for light salt and oil and still felt heavy after the meal and weren't able to finish a lot of it. 

Inside felt nice and clean as it is all newly built. Order and payment was initiated by QR code, staff would also confirm and occasionally check in to fill water.

3 stars
Service was mostly done over qr code. I didn't like how you have to ask in order to get any chili oil, soy sauce, or vinegar sauce. The dumpling appetizer was really good, and the soup dumplings were amazing. However, the Dan Dan noodles were plain and super creamy. The shrimp were 90% batter and too much breading. Otherwise, The tables were neatly organized and clean. The decorations were lacking but this place is a new location.

5 stars
My favorite restaurant in DFW amazing selection of Chinese dishes from traditional to more Americanized options. The must eat are the Szechuan Chicken, Szechuan Fish, marbled beef spicy hotpot, Dry Fried String beans and Bok Choy are delicious!! Food is always amazing and consistently great service! 

Their new location is very modern and welcoming for small and large groups alike

If you are in the area it's worth a visit!

5 stars
Each dish is amazing 
I highly recommend anything with Sichuan (:
The service is quick and they are very nice 

New spot - I have been twice and hasn't disappointed 

Crispy chicken is a must have and also the hot Pot

5 stars
Spicy frog was amazing but the bones make the fish or chicken easier to eat and they make sure it's spicy and tasty. I randomly crave mushrooms and green beans and only from this restaurant will I ever obtain them. My go to order shared with my review.

Friendly service! Easy ordering  via QR code. Clean establishment. Good for small or big groups. Good for family style.

Sichuan, spice, and everything nice!

Exceeded my expectations, especially the Tilapia Whole Fish & Lamb with Cumin Spice - delicious quality of Sichuan food in town! First came with party of 5 friends, loved the food so much... ordered to-go for my family for NYE!

==FOOD==
-Mapo Tofu: Standard

-Minced Beef with Egg White West Lake Soup: My go to soup, great flavor, salt & pepper not too overpowering and I like the mushroom bits.

-Deep Fried Chicken with Red Chilli: Fried chicken is soft and addicting! Can't have just one piece. Good chicken to chilli ratio, and good balance of spicy where it doesn't become chilli with a side of chicken.

-Lamb with Cumin spice: MMMM lamb is SURPRISINGLY super soft and juicy, nothing like how lamb skewers are sometimes (chewy and a lil gamey in flavor). Love the cumin sprinkles that adds a strong aromatic flavor. FAVE!

-Steamed Whole Fish (Tilapia):  WOW! BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! Highlight of the dinner. Menu specified as "live fish" in Chinese; we assumed this meant prepared fresh from a tank in the back as we didn't see tanks in the front? Steep price at $36... BUT probably BEST prepared tilapia I've had from a restaurant in awhile. Great for special occasions like holidays! Steamed JUST RIGHT where all parts of fish were soft and tender, and sauce had the perfect blend of soy sauce & cooking wine that permeated well into the entire fish.

Now downside... Rice isn't complimentary at  $1/bowl, but for 5 of us, rice came consolidated in a standard tub, and they even refilled it when it reached half empty. 

Casual dining. Plenty of tables for 4, few round tables of 8 with lazy Susans. Service is standard at Asian restaurant.

5 stars
Great atmosphere and good service.   They were fast and the food was perfectly spicy.

4 stars
Authentic sichuan cuisine! This place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon with a wait the entire time we were there. Full of families enjoying lunch!  Mapo Tofu was spicy and peppery with lots of silken tofu. Boiled fish was full of meat and veggies. We ordered the salt and pepper squid but they accidentally delivered the salt and pepper fish. We ate a few pieces before they realized their mistake and brought the squid. I actually preferred the fish.  They charge for steamed rice so be aware since most places don't. Overall I liked it but found it to be a little too greasy for me.

1 stars
Food tasted crazy. The chicken tasted like old refrigerated rotten meat. Don't recommend.

5 stars
Great lunch special!

The lunch special here is plenty of food, with rice, soup, and a dish for just $10ish. And the lunch special isn't a personal lunchbox, it is served with the dish separately which makes it nice to share family style.

Food came quickly and everything was very flavorful!

5 stars
When I came to this restaurant. Every single table was full. Despite this, we were seated as a walk in within 20 minutes. The table turnover time was less than 1 minute.

Immediately we were greeted and had drinks. We ordered and the waiter came by to confirm. 

The entrees came out maybe 20 minutes later and the food was piping hot. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were so large that my wife and I could only finish the dumplings and took the rest home for dinner. 

Amazing ambiance, clean tables, quick service, delicious food, and fair prices. I will definitely be coming back.

5 stars
Best fried rice ever.
Wish it was closer but have no problem driving there.  Simple order process, staff very helpful, really fresh ingredients.

1 stars
Food was loaded with MSG which for one is bad for you and two,  masks the true flavor of the food. 

Ambiance: typical Dallas in that it is plain and void of decor making it cold and uncomfortable. The waiting area is poorly designed as well as you sit there staring at the people eating and they at you. Fun. 

Service: waiting and ordering is done via kiosk and phone so very impersonal. The servers will bring the food out and are even more impersonal.

4 stars
Came here on a Friday night and got many dishes to share. Most of them were pretty solid, the ones that stood out to me were the deep fried chicken w chili and the fried string beans. The service was quite quick and easy to order online. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'd be back to try other dishes!

4 stars
Greeted with a smile. Service is outstanding and very detailed oriented to fit our needs.  5/5

Overall, food was on the salty sideby very tasty. Mapo Tofu was ordered extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint. Potatoes were a bit on the salty side.  Lo Mein was made perfectly. The spicy fish was a bit salty but flavorful.  The string beans were a bit wilted but ok.  The fried tofu fish was good, but the tofu was dry.  The snow pea shoots were cooked perfectly but were a bit on the salty side. Last but not least, spicy deep-fried fish was crispy, spicy, and tender. 3.5/5

There is plenty of parking.

The other Sichuan restaurant across the street closed for Chinese new year so we came here knowing they have pretty solid Sichuan food. 

Three mushroom pot : good, but I can't identify the 3rd mushroom, I could tell shiitake and oyster mushroom but not the 3rd one. 4/5 

Fried chicken with chili :3/5 
The other Sichuan restaurant executed this dish much better. Here, they used too much rice flour so each piece of chicken was hard and there was no numbing flavor 

Spicy Tofu and beef 4/5 
Beef was very tender but portion wasn't big. 

Would I come back? Yea, but this is my backup Sichuan place, not my primary Sichuan place. The best Sichuan place in town is still the one across the street

4 stars
Good food! Very techy way to order! Love how the language barrier has been cracked with the way you order. That said, the food also good! There is a lot of rush during the weekends!

5 stars
Sichuan Folk never disappoints. Any time we are craving home cooked chinese food, we always come here. There is never a wait and the staff is very friendly. Our go to dishes include the fish in fiery sauce, fried fish fillet in chili peppers, mapo tofu, and green beans!

4 stars
The food is very good.    Had to get the soup dumplings but they didn't give us the vinegar dipping sauce or ginger.   The place is always busy so that is a good sign.   Food is great.   Service was good just they was very busy.

5 stars
I could not think of a better meal to eat than some hot pot to celebrate Lunar New Year, and Sichuan Folk satisfied my cravings!

Most people don't know that they offer AYCE hot pot, and I don't blame them since the restaurant doesn't really advertise it at all. My boyfriend and I ate here multiple times in the past whenever we're craving Sichuanese food, and it's always delicious. However, their hot pot was even better!

I called the restaurant to see how busy they were on Lunar New Year Eve, and they said they were packed. I asked if they have hot pot tonight and they replied they do, but it's going to be a long wait (~1 hour). I didn't mind since most of the Asian restaurants are packed for the celebration, so we came and waited. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication on the phone but I came in and asked for AYCE hot pot, and they said they're not serving it tonight. I told them that I called on the phone earlier, and I don't mind waiting, but I already drove here so it's pointless to pick another place. The owner lady said okay and I just sat at the waiting chair. The restaurant was fully packed with customers, there weren't any empty tables left. They had big parties on the round tables, and smaller parties on the left side. 

It took about 25 mins to get seated, which is faster than the estimated one hour wait. The menu is online, so you just scan the QR code to order. The hot pot option was at the end, and it was a little confusing. The price was $24.95/person for AYCE, and a one-time fee of $10.95 extra for the soup. We had a party of 3, which equals out to about $28/person total. They had a lot of options on their hot pot menu, like the basic beef/lamp/pork/chicken shabu, then a bunch of seafood and vegetables. I was surprised to see lotus roots offered as well since other restaurants typically don't have it.

It took about 15 mins for the ingredients to come out. We picked both the plain and medium spicy broth, and it was SPICY. The server told me it was a 6/10 for a medium level, and I think my tongue died from the first taste. But, it was SO delicious, despite the burning. They did not skim on the amount of food that we ordered either. They brought 3 trays, separating the vegetables, sliced meats and seafood/noodles. Everything was so tasty with both broths that I'm still drooling. They refilled our broth constantly, and there's no extra charge for that. The meat slices are thin, and cooked instantly the second you put into the pot. OH! The hot pot is this big metal pot so there's plenty of space to cook your ingredients. There's a time limit of 1.5 hours, but we sat down at 8 and they didn't rush us until the restaurant was closing at 10 PM.

Overall, this is my new favorite hot pot restaurant! I've tried all the other AYCE hot pots in town (Manna, Happy Lamb, Squares, Gogiya, Volcano, etc), but nothing satisfied my cravings like Sichuan Folk. The price was perfect for the amount of food you get, and definitely cheaper if you have a bigger party since the broth is a one-time fee. Beware that they bring out your ingredients according to the number of people at your party. They gave me a huge tray of beef tripe even though the other two don't eat, since there's no "adjustment" on the app. Next time I'll ask if I can get a smaller portion for specific ingredients, but aside from that-- it's a 11/10.

So gooood! love the spice!
Son brought me here for like the 100th time but this time, for my birthday.... Yummmmmm

5 stars
I was craving some numbing pepper spicy food, and this place definitely hit the spot! 

Their menu is so expansive, it can be so overwhelming. However, even though we had hungry eyes, we were able to narrow down to 4 dishes between the four of us. The entrees are very generous, so we had leftovers (still delicious the next day)!

Absolutely amazing food! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Each of the following dishes below I would 100% order again! 

1) Deep Fried Chicken w.Roasted Chili
2) Lamb w.Cumin Sauce
3) Spicy Grill Whole Fish
4) Szechuan Spicy Cold Noodle


There's plenty of parking available!

Food was good, a bit salty though. Service was sort of strange/a little spotty, but then they were super busy. The worst thing about the experience and the reason we will not most likely go back is the place was SO LOUD! I practically lost my voice trying to talk to the person across the table. I don't think I've ever eaten in a restaurant where the acoustics were so bad. They really need to do sound dampening. When we finally walked outside, my husband exclaimed, "ah what a relief to just listen to the traffic noise of Central Expressway." 
If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.

4 stars
At first glance place is clean and fairly new looking. There was a self check in kiosk that said there was 3 ahead of us but it went fast. We sat down the waitress took our food order quickly. No menus you have to scan a QR and order thru that as well. We ordered the egg rolls, soup dumplings, combo fried rice, combo lo mien, twice cooked pork, three mushrooms, minced pork with yam noodles. Everything came out as it was made by whatever server was available. Everything was good but the minced pork with yam noodles was different. Not bad just different. The fried rice was nothing special compared to the other stuff. The lo mien noodles had a very good garlic flavor and the twice cooked pork was excellent but a tad spicy. I really wish I would have ordered one of the frog dishes. I will be back to try one. The type of service I don't really care for. It takes away from the experience I think. The whole do it yourself without paper menus or a server to talk to is the thing now but I don't care for it. Not having one server from start to finish leaves you just waiting longer than you should to get anything like napkins, soy sauce, or anything like that. I'll know for next time. We went to the other location that the GPS took up too and of course it's closed. Make sure you go to the right one on Legacy!!!

4 stars
Great food, decent ambience, prices are higher than original location but still outstanding taste and flavors. Decent portions and a lot of leftovers.

DO NOT RECOMEND! DON'T GO THERE! 

Went there for lunch, got the mapo tofu and fish with pickle. Lunch portion for both. Plus regular fish in boiled oil to go. 

Got charged dinner prices for the 2 lunch portions. Brought it up to the server. She insisted that we were charged lunch prices. Total was $52.85. My husband paid and tipped 20%.  

I knew it wasn't right and checked the menu prices. Mapo tofu $11.95, fish with pickle 16.95, and fish in boiled oil $23.95. Total $52.85. All dinner prices!  I was right, we were charged for dinner portions!!! I then asked for receipt since we already paid using their table side tablet. She just gave me the credit card receipt and not the itemized bill! 

We will NOT be back. I will NOT support businesses that cheat people!!!

4 stars
Good food that's reasonably priced for the higher end of Chinese food, very attentive staff, clean restrooms, nice open vibe. Only complaint is that it's kinda small and a lot people come so you might have to wait.

3 stars
The restaurant is clean and food is generally good. HOWEVER, do not come during any kind of lunch or dinner rush. They tend to oversalt the hell out of their dishes when it's busy especially the mapo tofu. If you manage to get here at a quieter time then the food is well seasoned.

4 stars
Fantastic Asian food! I don't really know what particular Asian cuisine it is and don't matter because it's fantastic!!
Most of the dishes I cant pronounce. Just look at the pictures and ask questions about what's in it. 
I haven't even tried the American menu yet.

5 stars
This place is so good - I straight up become feral and cannot stop eating. Order the spicy fish in boiled oil, green beans, mapo tofu and spicy cold noodles. Other things I've eaten and loved: dry fried bitter melon (divisive - you need to love bitter), tomato with egg, cucumber salad, dan dan noodles... I would love to sample every single thing on the (giant) menu but unfortunately I don't live here or have enough friends to make it possible. The service is always attentive. Child friendly. If you love flavor please go!

5 stars
Authentic. Quality. Good service. THE best place for Sichuan I know of in our general geography. I've had good Sichaun in China, San Francisco and other places. This one is another one of our regional gems!

4 stars
4.5 stars. 
This is probably one of the highest standards of Sichuan cuisine in DFW.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner, no problem getting a seat quickly around 6pm.  The servers were nice and friendly.  
Hotpot frogs - 4/5 stars.  The frog is something you all should try once.  Very fresh and they said they cooked it with live frogs.  You can tell the texture is better than frozen ones.  
Orange chicken - 4/5 stars.  Got this for the kids and it was fairly good.  Real white and clean chicken meat deep fried with a thick sweet sour sauce.  
Chili oil fish - 5/5 stars.  Flavorful, hot and spicy, and the peppercorns were the highlight.   The fish was so silky and tender.  
Sichuan cold noodles- 2/5 stars.  Underwhelming, I won't order it again.  Noodles were not chewy, the sauce didn't have the complex flavor I was looking for.  
Good place, we will be back.

5 stars
Review is for their Legacy/75 location - We've been 2x in the past month and enjoyed our experiences, definitely our new favorite! It gets busy so get there early or prepare to wait. Service is a little slow, but very nice and friendly and the food is the best Szechuan I've had in DFW. Huge portions, reasonable prices!

4 stars
Absolutely the best Sichuan food in DFW - their Mapo Tofu is so freaking legit, from the flavors to the numbing; it's mouthwatering just to think about. Other notable dishes that were tried: CQ Hot Chicken (also a must order - it's like super flavorful popcorn chicken), basil eggplant (YES), salt and pepper squid (not the best, you can skip it - many other places do a better job), and garlic green beans (how can you not order this at a Sichuan place? an easy staple).

I will be back for the mapo tofu, CQ hot chicken and basil eggplant!

5 stars
Service was excellent. Food was also great. I had the deep-fried chicken with roasted chilies, plus a side of steamed rice. Wonderful job. They came by to check on the table and even refilled water. I am not used to this kind of good treatment at Asian restaurants. Left 20% tip for lunch.

5 stars
Very friendly staff. Food is always fresh and hot. So far I've only tried the fried chicken and green beans. It's so delicious that I haven't ventured with any of the other entrees. Sure wish I lived closer because I would be there all the time. Atmosphere is nice. It would be great for date night (or afternoon).
