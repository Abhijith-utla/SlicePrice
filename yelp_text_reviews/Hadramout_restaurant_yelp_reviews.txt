Solid Yemeni food. Everything we ate was delicious. Would recommend the grilled chicken which was the best thing we tried. Definitely worth a try.

5 stars
Great food, large portions, reasonable price.
One meal and appetizer is enough for two.
We shall be back soon.

When we first walked into Hadramout Restaurant, the place was filled with smoke from the grill, which was overwhelming. We also noticed a lot of flies around, which was concerning. The waiter, however, was friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us, recommending a few dishes.

We decided to try the Mandi lamb, Kabsa lamb, and Hanith lamb. When the food arrived, we were impressed with both the taste and the portion sizes--everything was delicious, but the portions were so large that none of us could finish our meals.

However, I was disappointed by the cleanliness of the restaurant. For a party of six, they automatically added an 18% service charge, which is fair, but I hope they use that to improve the overall hygiene of the place. The cleanliness definitely needs more attention. If I crave this type of food again, I'll probably order it to-go instead of dining in.

5 stars
The Mandi at Hadramout is probably one of the best you'll find in DFW. I love how tender the chicken is, it's definitely a comfort food for me.

5 stars
My regular place for Mandi in Dallas . Love their combo Mandi lamb and chicken haneeth. My go to place

5 stars
Delicious food and reasonable price I order grilled fish came perfect not burned and not row was so good and tasty

If want try yemeni food this the right place to enjoy mendi lambs, but i am telling you once you try you never to stop going there.

4 stars
Attentive and quick service for a busy restaurant! We came in on a Friday night and while it was packed, we were able to get seated right away. Our food was also out within 5-10 minutes of ordering.

This restaurant is very affordable for the amount of food they give. Even as 3 hungry girls, we could've ordered 1 appetizer and 1 entree and been fine. We got the Mediterranean Plate to start, which was average. The only part I felt was skimpy was the accompanying bread--the 3 half pieces were not nearly enough for all the hummus and baba ghanoush. 

However, the extra spreads did make good pairings for the rice in the Kabasa Chicken and Mandi Chicken. I wish they came with yogurt sauce, but instead I used the hummus and salsa-type sauce they gave us at the beginning. The chicken was fall off the bone, but the breast meat was very dry despite the tenderness. 

Hadramout is a good beginner's dive into Yemeni and hits the spot for a craving, but definitely not the best you could try.

4 stars
This was my first time trying Yemeni food and it was delicious. The food had lots of flavor and chicken was very tender. The chicken literally fell off the bones. Each entree comes with a lot of rice, so the rice to chicken proportion is a bit off in my opinion. We also ordered the Mediterranean plate appetizer, which was also good, but it only came with 3 pieces of bread. We ended up having to pay for extra bread. They also charge you for water which I wasn't expecting. Overall, very nice to have something new in Plano.

5 stars
The management reached out they honored the Groupons and the food was amazing - we got the lamb hanith which was absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

5 stars
This is by far the best restaurant in DFW. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would. 

The mandi chicken will fall off the bone even if you just wiggle the plate. The fish is amazingly flavored and also is easy to remove from the bone. The dessert isn't too sweet but is by far some of the best dessert I've ever had. 

The service has always been amazing and the staff has always been so kind and friendly. I have been here about a handful of times and the restaurant continues to blow my mind and remain consistently amazing. 

I literally dream about this restaurant. There is not a better restaurant in DFW, and it is one of the only Yemeni restaurants around. I had never had Yemeni food prior to trying this restaurant, and what a great representation of it, it is. 

I recommend that EVERYONE tries this restaurant.

3 stars
Though this restaurant has great reviews on Google, it wasn't as good as it is portrayed. We had the Ogda chicken and the Mandi chicken. The chicken was kind of dry, the flavor was good and the rice was great, but the chicken was not moist, it was extremely tender, but it was not moist.

 And chicken does get like that if it's cooked too long or cooked in a crock pot or pressure cooker, it gets very tender but it loses its moisture somehow.  I realize it's not a Mediterranean or Pakistani restaurant, but every Middle Eastern restaurant I have eaten at, and I have eaten out a lot,  have some type of cucumber yogurt or tatziki sauce, they had yogurt but it was just plain out of the container yogurt.

I'm giving it three stars though because the food was fair and it was very affordable, there were three of us and the three meals we had more than filled us up and we had leftovers as well.

5 stars
The best Yemeni food in town hands down!  Their Hanith lamb and grilled chicken are my regular favorites.  Service can sometimes be slow but that is not a problem in comparison to the great taste of food.

5 stars
I've gone back to try the Hanith Lamb and in my opinion the Mandi is better. Both are good, the Hanith has more seasoning but that seasoning tastes mostly peppery and for me that just isn't quite as enjoyable as the Mandi.

I understand why people might like it more with chicken--if you like peppery chicken dishes, of course that would work.

I'll update again when I get to try other items but so far the Mandi Lamb is the winner.

5 stars
My oh my! I'm so happy we found an authentic Yemeni place here. We are used to amazing authentic Yemeni food in Brooklyn and this place was the perfect fit for our Yemeni food cravings. We got the lamb haneeth and chicken zirbeean. I can't rate one over the other, because both were amazing. They come with their own tomatoe based sauces. 

Plenty of seating and they have an enclosed family / Arabian floor seating which is really cool.

We went Friday night and it was pretty busy so account for that. 

Tip: We got a lamb broth soup and spread it over the lamb haneeth rice and it just made the meal so yummy and juicy.

5 stars
This is my second visit to the restaurant.
It's good to see the food has maintained a level of excellence.

I want to leave this restaurant 5 stars but unfortunately their service is not good at all. Their food is great, but it's not always the same, so their consistency maintaining the same taste will vary. The vibes are great as far as sitting down on the floor with curtains giving you utmost privacy... Any restaurant I review here more than 2 stars means iv been to the establishment multiple times. I truly think this cuisine joint can be a gemstone if they took it more seriously since there is no competition for yemenise cuisines.

5 stars
Chicken, Lamb, and rice is so flavorful - highly recommend. Ambiance is homey and nice on the inside, has a seating corner with Yemeni culture and feel.

4 stars
The service was quite quick when you put in a time you will arrive they make it fresh. 
The taste was full and light but nothing was bland. The rice was cooked to perfection and was well seasoned without it being overly salty.
The seasoning on the chicken was well coated though some parts of the chicken meat itself were a bit dry but it could be due to it being lean.

5 stars
This is a great place for the food. As you walk in and see a filled room with plastic sheets covering the table you know it's either going to be terrible or authentic. Fortunately it is clearly the latter. The food was excellent and prices were good for dishes that can be shared "family style". We really enjoyed it. It is not a western style restaurant. I gather it is a Yemeni restaurant. But wow! The flavors popped and the quality of dishes was excellent. Be ready for a fun cross cultural experience. No alcohol, for example. We asked if BYOB was acceptable but felt it was not, even though they did not want to say no. Rustic place. Good people, good food. Will definitely be back.

5 stars
I had a fantastic lamb dish that had two large meals' worth of food! Definitely got my money's worth. I would have preferred it spicier, but I was still very impressed. I would definitely go back!

Better than some mandi places I've had in the GCC! The food quality and flavors are authentic and the meat is fall off the bone tender. You cannot go wrong here. Service is just ok and if you have a large enough group you can sit in the floor seating areas

5 stars
If you like Arab food and fond of mandi and similar things, this is the place. Really scrumptious. Meat was tender and was falling of bones. Service is great. Ambiance is fine but not 5 star.
5 star rating is for food and service.

Food amazing, the meat and rice perfectly done
Service- absolutely fantastic, the men and the lady who served us was extremely nice and polite. 
Ambiance was BUSY, lol -- the place was hopping and the servers were moving as fast as humanly possible. 
Their red sauce and hummus were one of the tastiest I have had and the serving size was enormous. 
I am going back soon

5 stars
We got two types of rice with chicken and lamb. The platter feeds 6. One of the best rice and lamb I've ever had. Only one thing, a platter for 6 only has enough meat for 5. Aside from that I will be returning soon.

5 stars
Finally stopped here for takeout and tried the Zurbian chicken. The chicken was so moist and flavorful, fell right off the bone. It was absolutely delicious. The portion size is huge. I'll definitely be back. Check this place out! The atmosphere was very inviting, and the service was friendly.

5 stars
Best Hanith Lamb.Hanith Chicken.The only issue is they get super busy on Fridays - expect wait times.

Come ready to eat meat and rice here! The service was great, the food came quick, the meal was a good price for the amount of food you get. The hanith chicken was cooked very nicely, and had great flavor. Would definitely eat this again!

Better than some mandi places I've had in the GCC! The food quality and flavors are authentic and the meat is fall off the bone tender. You cannot go wrong here. Service is just ok and if you have a large enough group you can sit in the floor seating areas

5 stars
If you like Arab food and fond of mandi and similar things, this is the place. Really scrumptious. Meat was tender and was falling of bones. Service is great. Ambiance is fine but not 5 star.
5 star rating is for food and service.

5 stars
Excellent food! Seriously best in the business, would highly recommend to anyone who hasn't tried it yet! Fast service and a great place to take the family and eat or take home. 10 stars if possible.

One of the best places if you want to try something that is authentic Mandi specially lamb Mandi 
Amazing people amazing service and amazing food

5 stars
Great food and friendly atmosphere and people 
We have been going around to find a good mandi restaurant. Hadramout is the best we have found so far.

5 stars
Very tasty food. Highly recommend it it's my first time trying yamani food will be back for sure

5 stars
Food amazing, the meat and rice perfectly done
Service- absolutely fantastic, the men and the lady who served us was extremely nice and polite. 
Ambiance was BUSY, lol -- the place was hopping and the servers were moving as fast as humanly possible. 
Their red sauce and hummus were one of the tastiest I have had and the serving size was enormous. 
I am going back soon

5 stars
We got two types of rice with chicken and lamb. The platter feeds 6. One of the best rice and lamb I've ever had. Only one thing, a platter for 6 only has enough meat for 5. Aside from that I will be returning soon.

5 stars
Finally stopped here for takeout and tried the Zurbian chicken. The chicken was so moist and flavorful, fell right off the bone. It was absolutely delicious. The portion size is huge. I'll definitely be back. Check this place out! The atmosphere was very inviting, and the service was friendly.

5 stars
Best Hanith Lamb.Hanith Chicken.The only issue is they get super busy on Fridays - expect wait times.

5 stars
Their Mandi is the best! The chicken melts in your mouth & the lamb is so soft! We keep going back for more! Best part is the taste stays consistent!

5 stars
Great food! Very authentic it doesn't get any better than this. Prices are very low quality is very high. The Search for real Yemeni food in America is over this is it

5 stars
Amazing restaurant and staff. Super friendly people with ridiculously delicious food. I recommend Kabsa Lamb and Hanith Chicken. The meat literally falls off the bone, no knife required.

5 stars
Solid Yemeni food. Everything we ate was delicious. Would recommend the grilled chicken which was the best thing we tried. Definitely worth a try.

5 stars
Great food, large portions, reasonable price.
One meal and appetizer is enough for two.
We shall be back soon.
Grilled fish is a must try

3 stars
When we first walked into Hadramout Restaurant, the place was filled with smoke from the grill, which was overwhelming. We also noticed a lot of flies around, which was concerning. The waiter, however, was friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us, recommending a few dishes.

We decided to try the Mandi lamb, Kabsa lamb, and Hanith lamb. When the food arrived, we were impressed with both the taste and the portion sizes--everything was delicious, but the portions were so large that none of us could finish our meals.

However, I was disappointed by the cleanliness of the restaurant. For a party of six, they automatically added an 18% service charge, which is fair, but I hope they use that to improve the overall hygiene of the place. The cleanliness definitely needs more attention. If I crave this type of food again, I'll probably order it to-go instead of dining in.

5 stars
The Mandi at Hadramout is probably one of the best you'll find in DFW. I love how tender the chicken is, it's definitely a comfort food for me.

5 stars
My regular place for Mandi in Dallas . Love their combo Mandi lamb and chicken haneeth. My go to place

5 stars

4 stars
Attentive and quick service for a busy restaurant! We came in on a Friday night and while it was packed, we were able to get seated right away. Our food was also out within 5-10 minutes of ordering.

This restaurant is very affordable for the amount of food they give. Even as 3 hungry girls, we could've ordered 1 appetizer and 1 entree and been fine. We got the Mediterranean Plate to start, which was average. The only part I felt was skimpy was the accompanying bread--the 3 half pieces were not nearly enough for all the hummus and baba ghanoush. 

However, the extra spreads did make good pairings for the rice in the Kabasa Chicken and Mandi Chicken. I wish they came with yogurt sauce, but instead I used the hummus and salsa-type sauce they gave us at the beginning. The chicken was fall off the bone, but the breast meat was very dry despite the tenderness. 

Hadramout is a good beginner's dive into Yemeni and hits the spot for a craving, but definitely not the best you could try.

4 stars
This was my first time trying Yemeni food and it was delicious. The food had lots of flavor and chicken was very tender. The chicken literally fell off the bones. Each entree comes with a lot of rice, so the rice to chicken proportion is a bit off in my opinion. We also ordered the Mediterranean plate appetizer, which was also good, but it only came with 3 pieces of bread. We ended up having to pay for extra bread. They also charge you for water which I wasn't expecting. Overall, very nice to have something new in Plano.

5 stars
The management reached out they honored the Groupons and the food was amazing - we got the lamb hanith which was absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

5 stars
This is by far the best restaurant in DFW. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would. 

The mandi chicken will fall off the bone even if you just wiggle the plate. The fish is amazingly flavored and also is easy to remove from the bone. The dessert isn't too sweet but is by far some of the best dessert I've ever had. 

The service has always been amazing and the staff has always been so kind and friendly. I have been here about a handful of times and the restaurant continues to blow my mind and remain consistently amazing. 

I literally dream about this restaurant. There is not a better restaurant in DFW, and it is one of the only Yemeni restaurants around. I had never had Yemeni food prior to trying this restaurant, and what a great representation of it, it is. 

I recommend that EVERYONE tries this restaurant.

3 stars
Though this restaurant has great reviews on Google, it wasn't as good as it is portrayed. We had the Ogda chicken and the Mandi chicken. The chicken was kind of dry, the flavor was good and the rice was great, but the chicken was not moist, it was extremely tender, but it was not moist.

 And chicken does get like that if it's cooked too long or cooked in a crock pot or pressure cooker, it gets very tender but it loses its moisture somehow.  I realize it's not a Mediterranean or Pakistani restaurant, but every Middle Eastern restaurant I have eaten at, and I have eaten out a lot,  have some type of cucumber yogurt or tatziki sauce, they had yogurt but it was just plain out of the container yogurt.

I'm giving it three stars though because the food was fair and it was very affordable, there were three of us and the three meals we had more than filled us up and we had leftovers as well.

5 stars
The best Yemeni food in town hands down!  Their Hanith lamb and grilled chicken are my regular favorites.  Service can sometimes be slow but that is not a problem in comparison to the great taste of food.

5 stars
I've gone back to try the Hanith Lamb and in my opinion the Mandi is better. Both are good, the Hanith has more seasoning but that seasoning tastes mostly peppery and for me that just isn't quite as enjoyable as the Mandi.

I understand why people might like it more with chicken--if you like peppery chicken dishes, of course that would work.

I'll update again when I get to try other items but so far the Mandi Lamb is the winner.

5 stars
My oh my! I'm so happy we found an authentic Yemeni place here. We are used to amazing authentic Yemeni food in Brooklyn and this place was the perfect fit for our Yemeni food cravings. We got the lamb haneeth and chicken zirbeean. I can't rate one over the other, because both were amazing. They come with their own tomatoe based sauces. 

Plenty of seating and they have an enclosed family / Arabian floor seating which is really cool.

We went Friday night and it was pretty busy so account for that. 

Tip: We got a lamb broth soup and spread it over the lamb haneeth rice and it just made the meal so yummy and juicy.

5 stars
This is my second visit to the restaurant.
It's good to see the food has maintained a level of excellence.
The food is very good as well as the portion sizes.
Looking forward to visiting again when in town.

I want to leave this restaurant 5 stars but unfortunately their service is not good at all. Their food is great, but it's not always the same, so their consistency maintaining the same taste will vary. The vibes are great as far as sitting down on the floor with curtains giving you utmost privacy... Any restaurant I review here more than 2 stars means iv been to the establishment multiple times. I truly think this cuisine joint can be a gemstone if they took it more seriously since there is no competition for yemenise cuisines.

5 stars
Chicken, Lamb, and rice is so flavorful - highly recommend. Ambiance is homey and nice on the inside, has a seating corner with Yemeni culture and feel.

4 stars
The service was quite quick when you put in a time you will arrive they make it fresh. 
The taste was full and light but nothing was bland. The rice was cooked to perfection and was well seasoned without it being overly salty.
The seasoning on the chicken was well coated though some parts of the chicken meat itself were a bit dry but it could be due to it being lean.

5 stars
This is a great place for the food. As you walk in and see a filled room with plastic sheets covering the table you know it's either going to be terrible or authentic. Fortunately it is clearly the latter. The food was excellent and prices were good for dishes that can be shared "family style". We really enjoyed it. It is not a western style restaurant. I gather it is a Yemeni restaurant. But wow! The flavors popped and the quality of dishes was excellent. Be ready for a fun cross cultural experience. No alcohol, for example. We asked if BYOB was acceptable but felt it was not, even though they did not want to say no. Rustic place. Good people, good food. Will definitely be back.

 And chicken does get like that if it's cooked too long or cooked in a crock pot or pressure cooker, it gets very tender but it loses its moisture somehow.  I realize it's not a Mediterranean or Pakistani restaurant, but every Middle Eastern restaurant I have eaten at, and I have eaten out a lot,  have some type of cucumber yogurt or tatziki sauce, they had yogurt but it was just plain out of the container yogurt.

I'm giving it three stars though because the food was fair and it was very affordable, there were three of us and the three meals we had more than filled us up and we had leftovers as well.

The best Yemeni food in town hands down!  Their Hanith lamb and grilled chicken are my regular favorites.  Service can sometimes be slow but that is not a problem in comparison to the great taste of food.

5 stars
I've gone back to try the Hanith Lamb and in my opinion the Mandi is better. Both are good, the Hanith has more seasoning but that seasoning tastes mostly peppery and for me that just isn't quite as enjoyable as the Mandi.

I understand why people might like it more with chicken--if you like peppery chicken dishes, of course that would work.

I'll update again when I get to try other items but so far the Mandi Lamb is the winner.

5 stars
My oh my! I'm so happy we found an authentic Yemeni place here. We are used to amazing authentic Yemeni food in Brooklyn and this place was the perfect fit for our Yemeni food cravings. We got the lamb haneeth and chicken zirbeean. I can't rate one over the other, because both were amazing. They come with their own tomatoe based sauces. 

Plenty of seating and they have an enclosed family / Arabian floor seating which is really cool.

We went Friday night and it was pretty busy so account for that. 

Tip: We got a lamb broth soup and spread it over the lamb haneeth rice and it just made the meal so yummy and juicy.

5 stars
This is my second visit to the restaurant.
It's good to see the food has maintained a level of excellence.
The food is very good as well as the portion sizes.
Looking forward to visiting again when in town.

I want to leave this restaurant 5 stars but unfortunately their service is not good at all. Their food is great, but it's not always the same, so their consistency maintaining the same taste will vary. The vibes are great as far as sitting down on the floor with curtains giving you utmost privacy... Any restaurant I review here more than 2 stars means iv been to the establishment multiple times. I truly think this cuisine joint can be a gemstone if they took it more seriously since there is no competition for yemenise cuisines.

5 stars
Chicken, Lamb, and rice is so flavorful - highly recommend. Ambiance is homey and nice on the inside, has a seating corner with Yemeni culture and feel.

4 stars
The service was quite quick when you put in a time you will arrive they make it fresh. 
The taste was full and light but nothing was bland. The rice was cooked to perfection and was well seasoned without it being overly salty.
The seasoning on the chicken was well coated though some parts of the chicken meat itself were a bit dry but it could be due to it being lean.

5 stars
This is a great place for the food. As you walk in and see a filled room with plastic sheets covering the table you know it's either going to be terrible or authentic. Fortunately it is clearly the latter. The food was excellent and prices were good for dishes that can be shared "family style". We really enjoyed it. It is not a western style restaurant. I gather it is a Yemeni restaurant. But wow! The flavors popped and the quality of dishes was excellent. Be ready for a fun cross cultural experience. No alcohol, for example. We asked if BYOB was acceptable but felt it was not, even though they did not want to say no. Rustic place. Good people, good food. Will definitely be back.

5 stars
I had a fantastic lamb dish that had two large meals' worth of food! Definitely got my money's worth. I would have preferred it spicier, but I was still very impressed. I would definitely go back!

Food amazing, the meat and rice perfectly done
Service- absolutely fantastic, the men and the lady who served us was extremely nice and polite. 
Ambiance was BUSY, lol -- the place was hopping and the servers were moving as fast as humanly possible. 
Their red sauce and hummus were one of the tastiest I have had and the serving size was enormous. 
I am going back soon

5 stars
We got two types of rice with chicken and lamb. The platter feeds 6. One of the best rice and lamb I've ever had. Only one thing, a platter for 6 only has enough meat for 5. Aside from that I will be returning soon.

5 stars
Finally stopped here for takeout and tried the Zurbian chicken. The chicken was so moist and flavorful, fell right off the bone. It was absolutely delicious. The portion size is huge. I'll definitely be back. Check this place out! The atmosphere was very inviting, and the service was friendly.

5 stars
Best Hanith Lamb.Hanith Chicken.The only issue is they get super busy on Fridays - expect wait times.

Amazing restaurant and staff. Super friendly people with ridiculously delicious food. I recommend Kabsa Lamb and Hanith Chicken. The meat literally falls off the bone, no knife required.

Grilled fish is a must try

When we first walked into Hadramout Restaurant, the place was filled with smoke from the grill, which was overwhelming. We also noticed a lot of flies around, which was concerning. The waiter, however, was friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us, recommending a few dishes.

We decided to try the Mandi lamb, Kabsa lamb, and Hanith lamb. When the food arrived, we were impressed with both the taste and the portion sizes--everything was delicious, but the portions were so large that none of us could finish our meals.

However, I was disappointed by the cleanliness of the restaurant. For a party of six, they automatically added an 18% service charge, which is fair, but I hope they use that to improve the overall hygiene of the place. The cleanliness definitely needs more attention. If I crave this type of food again, I'll probably order it to-go instead of dining in.

5 stars
The Mandi at Hadramout is probably one of the best you'll find in DFW. I love how tender the chicken is, it's definitely a comfort food for me.

5 stars
My regular place for Mandi in Dallas . Love their combo Mandi lamb and chicken haneeth. My go to place

5 stars

If want try yemeni food this the right place to enjoy mendi lambs, but i am telling you once you try you never to stop going there.

4 stars
Attentive and quick service for a busy restaurant! We came in on a Friday night and while it was packed, we were able to get seated right away. Our food was also out within 5-10 minutes of ordering.

This restaurant is very affordable for the amount of food they give. Even as 3 hungry girls, we could've ordered 1 appetizer and 1 entree and been fine. We got the Mediterranean Plate to start, which was average. The only part I felt was skimpy was the accompanying bread--the 3 half pieces were not nearly enough for all the hummus and baba ghanoush. 

However, the extra spreads did make good pairings for the rice in the Kabasa Chicken and Mandi Chicken. I wish they came with yogurt sauce, but instead I used the hummus and salsa-type sauce they gave us at the beginning. The chicken was fall off the bone, but the breast meat was very dry despite the tenderness. 

Hadramout is a good beginner's dive into Yemeni and hits the spot for a craving, but definitely not the best you could try.

4 stars
This was my first time trying Yemeni food and it was delicious. The food had lots of flavor and chicken was very tender. The chicken literally fell off the bones. Each entree comes with a lot of rice, so the rice to chicken proportion is a bit off in my opinion. We also ordered the Mediterranean plate appetizer, which was also good, but it only came with 3 pieces of bread. We ended up having to pay for extra bread. They also charge you for water which I wasn't expecting. Overall, very nice to have something new in Plano.

5 stars
The management reached out they honored the Groupons and the food was amazing - we got the lamb hanith which was absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

5 stars
This is by far the best restaurant in DFW. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would. 

The mandi chicken will fall off the bone even if you just wiggle the plate. The fish is amazingly flavored and also is easy to remove from the bone. The dessert isn't too sweet but is by far some of the best dessert I've ever had. 

The service has always been amazing and the staff has always been so kind and friendly. I have been here about a handful of times and the restaurant continues to blow my mind and remain consistently amazing. 

I literally dream about this restaurant. There is not a better restaurant in DFW, and it is one of the only Yemeni restaurants around. I had never had Yemeni food prior to trying this restaurant, and what a great representation of it, it is. 

I recommend that EVERYONE tries this restaurant.

When we first walked into Hadramout Restaurant, the place was filled with smoke from the grill, which was overwhelming. We also noticed a lot of flies around, which was concerning. The waiter, however, was friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us, recommending a few dishes.

We decided to try the Mandi lamb, Kabsa lamb, and Hanith lamb. When the food arrived, we were impressed with both the taste and the portion sizes--everything was delicious, but the portions were so large that none of us could finish our meals.

However, I was disappointed by the cleanliness of the restaurant. For a party of six, they automatically added an 18% service charge, which is fair, but I hope they use that to improve the overall hygiene of the place. The cleanliness definitely needs more attention. If I crave this type of food again, I'll probably order it to-go instead of dining in.

5 stars
The Mandi at Hadramout is probably one of the best you'll find in DFW. I love how tender the chicken is, it's definitely a comfort food for me.

5 stars
My regular place for Mandi in Dallas . Love their combo Mandi lamb and chicken haneeth. My go to place

5 stars

If want try yemeni food this the right place to enjoy mendi lambs, but i am telling you once you try you never to stop going there.

4 stars
Attentive and quick service for a busy restaurant! We came in on a Friday night and while it was packed, we were able to get seated right away. Our food was also out within 5-10 minutes of ordering.

This restaurant is very affordable for the amount of food they give. Even as 3 hungry girls, we could've ordered 1 appetizer and 1 entree and been fine. We got the Mediterranean Plate to start, which was average. The only part I felt was skimpy was the accompanying bread--the 3 half pieces were not nearly enough for all the hummus and baba ghanoush. 

However, the extra spreads did make good pairings for the rice in the Kabasa Chicken and Mandi Chicken. I wish they came with yogurt sauce, but instead I used the hummus and salsa-type sauce they gave us at the beginning. The chicken was fall off the bone, but the breast meat was very dry despite the tenderness. 

Hadramout is a good beginner's dive into Yemeni and hits the spot for a craving, but definitely not the best you could try.

4 stars
This was my first time trying Yemeni food and it was delicious. The food had lots of flavor and chicken was very tender. The chicken literally fell off the bones. Each entree comes with a lot of rice, so the rice to chicken proportion is a bit off in my opinion. We also ordered the Mediterranean plate appetizer, which was also good, but it only came with 3 pieces of bread. We ended up having to pay for extra bread. They also charge you for water which I wasn't expecting. Overall, very nice to have something new in Plano.

5 stars
The management reached out they honored the Groupons and the food was amazing - we got the lamb hanith which was absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

5 stars
This is by far the best restaurant in DFW. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would. 

The mandi chicken will fall off the bone even if you just wiggle the plate. The fish is amazingly flavored and also is easy to remove from the bone. The dessert isn't too sweet but is by far some of the best dessert I've ever had. 

The service has always been amazing and the staff has always been so kind and friendly. I have been here about a handful of times and the restaurant continues to blow my mind and remain consistently amazing. 

I literally dream about this restaurant. There is not a better restaurant in DFW, and it is one of the only Yemeni restaurants around. I had never had Yemeni food prior to trying this restaurant, and what a great representation of it, it is. 

I recommend that EVERYONE tries this restaurant.

3 stars
Though this restaurant has great reviews on Google, it wasn't as good as it is portrayed. We had the Ogda chicken and the Mandi chicken. The chicken was kind of dry, the flavor was good and the rice was great, but the chicken was not moist, it was extremely tender, but it was not moist.

 And chicken does get like that if it's cooked too long or cooked in a crock pot or pressure cooker, it gets very tender but it loses its moisture somehow.  I realize it's not a Mediterranean or Pakistani restaurant, but every Middle Eastern restaurant I have eaten at, and I have eaten out a lot,  have some type of cucumber yogurt or tatziki sauce, they had yogurt but it was just plain out of the container yogurt.

I'm giving it three stars though because the food was fair and it was very affordable, there were three of us and the three meals we had more than filled us up and we had leftovers as well.

5 stars
The best Yemeni food in town hands down!  Their Hanith lamb and grilled chicken are my regular favorites.  Service can sometimes be slow but that is not a problem in comparison to the great taste of food.

5 stars
I've gone back to try the Hanith Lamb and in my opinion the Mandi is better. Both are good, the Hanith has more seasoning but that seasoning tastes mostly peppery and for me that just isn't quite as enjoyable as the Mandi.

I understand why people might like it more with chicken--if you like peppery chicken dishes, of course that would work.

I'll update again when I get to try other items but so far the Mandi Lamb is the winner.

5 stars
My oh my! I'm so happy we found an authentic Yemeni place here. We are used to amazing authentic Yemeni food in Brooklyn and this place was the perfect fit for our Yemeni food cravings. We got the lamb haneeth and chicken zirbeean. I can't rate one over the other, because both were amazing. They come with their own tomatoe based sauces. 

Plenty of seating and they have an enclosed family / Arabian floor seating which is really cool.

We went Friday night and it was pretty busy so account for that. 

Tip: We got a lamb broth soup and spread it over the lamb haneeth rice and it just made the meal so yummy and juicy.

5 stars
This is my second visit to the restaurant.
It's good to see the food has maintained a level of excellence.
The food is very good as well as the portion sizes.
Looking forward to visiting again when in town.

3 stars
I want to leave this restaurant 5 stars but unfortunately their service is not good at all. Their food is great, but it's not always the same, so their consistency maintaining the same taste will vary. The vibes are great as far as sitting down on the floor with curtains giving you utmost privacy... Any restaurant I review here more than 2 stars means iv been to the establishment multiple times. I truly think this cuisine joint can be a gemstone if they took it more seriously since there is no competition for yemenise cuisines.

5 stars
Chicken, Lamb, and rice is so flavorful - highly recommend. Ambiance is homey and nice on the inside, has a seating corner with Yemeni culture and feel.

4 stars
The service was quite quick when you put in a time you will arrive they make it fresh. 
The taste was full and light but nothing was bland. The rice was cooked to perfection and was well seasoned without it being overly salty.
The seasoning on the chicken was well coated though some parts of the chicken meat itself were a bit dry but it could be due to it being lean.

5 stars
This is a great place for the food. As you walk in and see a filled room with plastic sheets covering the table you know it's either going to be terrible or authentic. Fortunately it is clearly the latter. The food was excellent and prices were good for dishes that can be shared "family style". We really enjoyed it. It is not a western style restaurant. I gather it is a Yemeni restaurant. But wow! The flavors popped and the quality of dishes was excellent. Be ready for a fun cross cultural experience. No alcohol, for example. We asked if BYOB was acceptable but felt it was not, even though they did not want to say no. Rustic place. Good people, good food. Will definitely be back.

5 stars
I had a fantastic lamb dish that had two large meals' worth of food! Definitely got my money's worth. I would have preferred it spicier, but I was still very impressed. I would definitely go back!

4 stars
Come ready to eat meat and rice here! The service was great, the food came quick, the meal was a good price for the amount of food you get. The hanith chicken was cooked very nicely, and had great flavor. Would definitely eat this again!

Better than some mandi places I've had in the GCC! The food quality and flavors are authentic and the meat is fall off the bone tender. You cannot go wrong here. Service is just ok and if you have a large enough group you can sit in the floor seating areas

5 stars
If you like Arab food and fond of mandi and similar things, this is the place. Really scrumptious. Meat was tender and was falling of bones. Service is great. Ambiance is fine but not 5 star.
5 star rating is for food and service.

5 stars
Excellent food! Seriously best in the business, would highly recommend to anyone who hasn't tried it yet! Fast service and a great place to take the family and eat or take home. 10 stars if possible.

Service- absolutely fantastic, the men and the lady who served us was extremely nice and polite.

Their red sauce and hummus were one of the tastiest I have had and the serving size was enormous. 
I am going back soon

5 stars
We got two types of rice with chicken and lamb. The platter feeds 6. One of the best rice and lamb I've ever had. Only one thing, a platter for 6 only has enough meat for 5. Aside from that I will be returning soon.

5 stars
Finally stopped here for takeout and tried the Zurbian chicken. The chicken was so moist and flavorful, fell right off the bone. It was absolutely delicious. The portion size is huge. I'll definitely be back. Check this place out! The atmosphere was very inviting, and the service was friendly.

5 stars
Best Hanith Lamb.Hanith Chicken.The only issue is they get super busy on Fridays - expect wait times.
