Review: My 2nd time ordering Mr. Jims. My first order was really good... the 2nd not so good. The wings seemed to have the crust(don't know what else to call it) just rub off the wings.. like they were old.. no flavor except they were spicy hot. The pizza was bleh.. had plenty of cheese, pepperoni and beef on it. I got an unsavory taste from the cheese and the beef resembled little rocks. Felt like chewing on rocks. I signed up for emails and coupons thinking I could/would use them. Well, the only location near me is 5 miles from my terminal and they don't/ won't deliver there. So I paid Grubhub instead to bring my delivery. Wasn't worth what I paid. Unfortunately, I won't be ordering from Mr. Jim's again. It might be for others, just isn't for me. Wish yall the best.

Review: Super delicious pizza. Ordered normal pepperoni and it satisfied my hunger. Also got garlic sticks but didn't take a pic, they were fluffy and had a nice amount of garlic, very tasty. Had previously ordered the pep deluxe (xtra pep and xtra cheese) and it definitely helped a hangover. Great local pizza spot!!

Review: I ordered a meat lovers pizza online. It came quickly and the delivery man was courteous and obeyed social distancing. The pizza was delicious. Not over topped or soggy. Something about the pizza made it taste exactly the same when reheated. I would definitely order from here again. Carollton location!

Review: Ordered from here for the first time in a while. Have been extremely disappointed with the local pizza places but Mr. Jim's satisfied my hunger. Plenty of options and styles to choose from. Quick delivery even in inclement weather. If you don't want pizza and have been frustrated with your local options,  keep Mr. Jim's in mind for a satisfying bite.
