Review: I used to work day in and day out until very late night. Usually by the time I got off from work, every place was closed and I had very limited options on what I wanted to eat then I discovered Zio Als 

This place was the best thing I could've ever discovered for my late night cravings. They have a little bit of everything and it's always prepared fresh. I have never had a bad thing on their menu and I will continue to go here.

Review: My father and I ordered Zio Al's for delivery and it was pretty good. The food came quickly but was very cold (could have been a DoorDash thing). When heated up the pizza was pretty good, but had little to no sauce. It was very dry and had too much cheese. The Chicken Caesar was fresh and plentiful.

I probably wouldn't get it again because I'm only visiting and there's so many other pizza options, but it served its purpose.

Review: Late night grub Zio Al's has you!

After a night out, Zio Al's was the only place pumping out grub. As a first timer, I went with a classic meat pizza .. plentiful in toppings the small was filling. The crust is light and airy, sauce wasn't overpowering. 

The establishment itself isn't big therefore don't expect much outside of good flavors. Late night it can be crowded however wait time for my order wasn't long. Shoutout to Sergio for being great with the service.

Review: This is anything but authentic Italian food. How do you mess up spaghetti and meatballs even if you don't know Italian cooking? 

I have never had their pizza but it looked good on the table next to us. I would have probably liked anything other than the dish I had.  The smell in the restaurant was very bleach heavy. Not an appetizing smell. I am glad they take cleaning seriously but wow.

Not to be gross, but my stomach did not keep the mush y mess of spaghetti down for long. I had to eject.

Review: Stopped in for a quick bite while in McKinney. The pizza was great, nothing overly amazing. I LOVED the chicken parm, definitely had to add a packet of Parmesan to add a little flavor though. The GARLIC BREAD  is a must haha. Very cute and snazzy place. Open late, the inside seems very clean. Would recommend.

Review: Was told by a friend how amazing this place was.  Ordered a pepperoni and a Hawaiian.  Delivery was well over an hour but may have been an UberEats thing, so okay with that.  However. both pizzas had very little sauce and a lot of cheese.  Both were well overcooked, the pepperoni so bad they were dark and curled up and barely chewable and both had that burnt taste to them.  First order didn't make me a fan... maybe okay for a drunken 2am order?  Guess I will stick with what I know.

Review: So we had several long black hairs embedded into several slices of our pizza last night, which we ordered at 9:40pm. (See photos) Don't get me wrong, we love Zio Al. They were our go-to for pizza. They have an amazing supreme chicken Alfredo pizza and their service is always friendly

Unfortunately, we don't plan to return to any of their locations for a while. Do better, Zio Al. You could have the best pizza in town, so get your quality control in order before it gets worse. Hair is unacceptable

Edit: Sarah from Zio Al reached out to us and apologized, which we appreciated! When a company can take accountability, it really shows they want to improve and put customers first. Something I never see in national pizza chains. 
We hope to return again sometime and leave another, hopefully positive, review when that time comes. No restaurant is perfect, so just be careful. I'm positive this was a rare mistake

Review: I let this pizza place waste an hour of my day and they didn't care! 

I just left and I'm absolutely pissed. I ordered takeout and waited an hour (which was also a little slow on my part but I did anyway)

The chick at the counter kept saying a few more minutes and then i proceeded to watch people who came after me walk in and get their food.

I feel like I was being toyed with and wasn't taken serious. Great pizza but I will never eat here again. 

Let's see if I get this "voucher" I was promised as she wrote my wife's name and number on a sticky note 

I left a pizza place waste an hour of my time today.

Review: The food is good... when they give you your correct order. Here's a hack - order from here on Uber Eats, watch them get your order wrong, and then get a refund for your food and tip a friendly Uber Eats driver. Trust me, it's happened to me 3 times now.

One of the times I ordered a gyro pizza, which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, gyro meat, white sauce, etc. I received a pizza with only gyro meat on it. I don't even know how an employee can allow that to happen. Are you not looking directly at the food at all when closing the pizza box lid?

This time I requested "thin crispy", which is a literal $2 up-charge - and I received a normal pizza. I also requested for the pepperoni to be halal - a $1 up-charge. When they can't pay attention to one modification, how can I trust that they're paying attention to another?? Definitely will not be letting my halal-only parents eat any. 

Tonight Uber Eats notified me that I have ordered from this place six times, I was surprised and disappointed with myself. Disappointed because they've officially gotten 3 out of 6 orders I have placed with them wrong, surprised because I can't believe I let it happen a third time. 

Like I said, if you'll eat whatever they deliver and want to get a refund without lying - apparently 50% of the time this will be your spot.

Review: I used Zio Al's catering for a work event that took place at the Private School where I work. They were extremely helpful from beginning to end. This event was to feed 120 guests who also had dietary restrictions. I was able to share what I was looking for and 2 of their managers Zafnat and Moe ensured that my needs were met. They were communicative via phone, and email, and answered all of my questions. I had never heard of or used Zio Al's, so I did a quick Google search, reviewed their menu, and reached out.  Not only were they affordable, but they were also reliable and the food was tasty!

If you have an event that needs catering, I highly recommend using Zio Al's.

Review: I am sad to say my family will not be ordering from this location ever again. We have been huge fans and loyal customers to this location for the last 3 years. We have ALWAYS ordered delivery and had excellent service from the drivers and employees. Tonight on the later shift, we called to place our normal order and the female that was answering phone was not only rude, but told us they do not deliver to our location. Again, we have been getting delivery from them for 3 years and literally delivered 3 days prior to us. When we asked why and how would that have changed, she said because we live 12 minutes away and they only deliver to 10 minutes away... what an absolute joke. She even said "oh yeah I see you guys order from us a lot.." Her name is Sarah, she needs to be fired. She is causing you to lose loyal customers. We are extremely disappointed as we always order over $60 worth of food and tip the drivers $20. As a store manager myself, I can assure you, Sarah is bad for your business.

Review: Pizza arrived warm but still didn't taste tooo fresh for some reason. The crusts for the pizzas were unevenly cooked and had some doughy parts. Very bread-y pizza so if you like that this is the place to go. 

The cheesy bread was underwhelming, essentially a cheese pizza without sauce and very oily. 
Fries are good but serving size small.

Overall, would not eat here again but it was open on Christmas so that's something.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Cheese sticks - They are hit or miss. Sometimes there's barely any cheese, others it's too much. I still enjoy them.

Wings - They changed their wings in quality and price. The kind they have now are more breaded. They have a nice flavor.

Pizza - The pizza is decent. Way better than chain restaurants for sure. 

All in all it's a nice restaurant. If they make an error or you don't like what you've ordered, they'll accommodate you with no issue. Big bonus they're open until 4am.

Review: Yummy - friends also tried & loved. Dining in or taking out, Zio Al's never disappoints. We have tried pizzas & subs. My favorite is Alfredo with pepperoni. Hubz loves all meat & the meatball sub. Frankly, we will probably go through a majority of the menu since we live so close. 
Salads are salads. This isn't a dig. If any establishment wants to up their game: have at it. For the most part they are all alike unless they have the house dressing made with red sauce. Lettuce is always crunchy water no matter how ya package it. Back to Zio's: getcha a nice greasy slice. Add it to your Yelp. It's with it.

Review: My family was ordering from here at least 1-2x a month.  Stopped going because the last time my wife placed an order over the phone and went to pick up the order, they did not have the order at all.  Seems like the person that took the order never placed it after hanging up.

Mistakes happen and that's fine, but the problem is the person tried to be dismissive and did not acknowledge the problem.  No sorry or anything.

Review: I used to love this place! The last few times I've ordered from this location my food has not been good. It doesn't even look or taste the same like it used to. This is the closest location to me but I would rather drive to the other locations knowing I will be satisfied.

Review: I got this place delivered. I got the gyro pizza, traditional wings (lemon pepper) and the Cesar salad. 

The pizza was decent... they put ALOT of cheese in their pizza. And the crust is really soft so your crusts might stick together when you pull it, not the usual pizza texture you would expect? 

The wings are great but the lemon pepper was VERY SALTY. I think it would have been perfect if it wasn't so salty.

The salad was very average. Overall I think a place worth checking out if you like cheesy pizza! I think their pizza is the selling point.

Review: They could not make a pizza without cheese due to a food allergy. That is unfortunate since we were from out of town and wanted to order pizzas for our family...among a few other items with the pizzas too. This place is not in the hospitality business and not trying to serve customers to be profitable. Guess the local Dominos gets more business tonight.

Review: I placed an order for pick up and told ready at 6pm per app. I was late and arrived at 6:30p and told by staff 3-4 minutes. Pizza finally given to me at 6:45p, now 45 minutes after the original time promised and it was the wrong pizza. When pointed out, the cashier answered the phone and ignored me, so I left with the wrong pizza. 
Food has always been good as was this visit, but I will never return!

Review: We love Zio Als!  I always like finding a good non-national chain pizza place to support and this is our go-to local pizza delivery option.

They have quite an extensive menu here, with lots of toppings and pre-made recipes for the pizzas.  My absolute favorites are the Signature Pizza (NY Style Crust, Pepperoni, Beef, Breakfast Bacon, Basil, Sliced Tomatoes and Mozarella) and Spinach Alfredo (Alfredo Sauce, Spinach, and Cheese).  They also have several crust options, including stuffed crust.

We've gotten some of the breadsticks/cheesesticks, apps, and desserts a few times, and they're decent.  It's the pizza itself that keeps us coming back.

Bonus: open late - until 3AM!

Rating: 2 stars
Review: Third time picking up from Zio and will be our last. Tonight we got the hand tossed half Hawaiian and half chicken pesto. Way too much cheese, threw it out of balance. The pesto sauce was very oily and somewhat an off putting taste. Combined with all the cheese, made for a terribly greasy pie. The Hawaiian portion was better. Our first visit was more than a year ago. Got deep dish, weren't fans and didn't plan on a return. A month ago friends ordered a margarita and pepperoni, thin crusts, which were good. You will notice that they offer 5 or 6 different types of crusts. My experience is few places can excel at all. Maybe thin crust is the way to go?

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Best thing about this place, it's open late. Fresh food late at night. 

I had their lemon pepper wings and man... these were huge!!! Extremely crispy and full of flavor. Highly recommend it. I also had their boneless wings with their signature sweet teriyaki sauce, would definitely get that next time except with flats. 

Now pizzas- another great service they offer- you can order half and half so obviously we did just that. 1 small pizza can easily fill up 4 people. We ordered the Buffalo pizza with half BBQ pizza. I liked the BBQ one more compared to buffalo. Second pizza was NY specialty and Meatball lovers. For this one, the sure win was the Meatball lover. Don't get me wrong, they were all great, just the meatball lover was the best. 

If you're in Dallas I would definitely recommend this place.

Review: The night shift worker is extremely rude she wears glasses. I came in one time & she asked me if i was going to tip & but  then she insisted that i didn't have too. Is that what you guys train your employees to do ? The cheesecake here is terrible.  the crust tastes old. Pizza here never looks great compared to the other locations. Im a loyal customer i've been to all the other locations throughout the metroplex . Not sure if this is a real policy but i asked if i could change the size of my pizza & she told me i couldn't because the pizza was in the oven already so if i wanted to get another size i would have to buy another pizza.  This one by far is the worst. If you guys don't mind the drive go to the one in McKinney they are 100x better pizza is amazing !

Review: We ordered the meatball sandwich and the chicken club. 
They were both good and everything was an appropriate warm temperature.  The fries were great,although not a large portion. 

I was highly irritated that if you want to have veggies or anything on it they up charge you for every single thing. It's exactly why i did not* order the wings, if you want any sauce/flavor on it they up charge an additional 99 cents! Insane. 

Service was fine, i ordered online and to go, so interaction was extremely minimal. 

If they stopped nickel and diming on the menu and provided a slightly larger portion to meet the high prices this place would 100% be 5 stars for the sandwiches.

Review: I was in town for 3 weeks on a business trip.  I asked a local friend who had really good authentic pizza?  She very highly recommended Zito Al's and boy I now see why.  I got the loaded meat pizza not one but twice while I was in town.  It was so easy to keep reaching in for another slice I ate the whole large pizza in one sitting each time.  The service was fantastic, and I had the same delivery driver both times and he was awesome, friendly and always on time.  The next time I'm back in the area which will be soon, I know where I'm going for great pizza.

Review: I used to love this place! The last few times I've ordered from this location my food has not been good. It doesn't even look or taste the same like it used to. This is the closest location to me but I would rather drive to the other locations knowing I will be satisfied.

Review: Great pizza!   Ordered 20 pizzas and salads for delivery for an office lunch.  Easy process ordering online, great customer service calling with updates.   Team loved the pizza!

Review: I got this place delivered. I got the gyro pizza, traditional wings (lemon pepper) and the Cesar salad. 

The pizza was decent... they put ALOT of cheese in their pizza. And the crust is really soft so your crusts might stick together when you pull it, not the usual pizza texture you would expect? 

The wings are great but the lemon pepper was VERY SALTY. I think it would have been perfect if it wasn't so salty.

The salad was very average. Overall I think a place worth checking out if you like cheesy pizza! I think their pizza is the selling point.

Review: They could not make a pizza without cheese due to a food allergy. That is unfortunate since we were from out of town and wanted to order pizzas for our family...among a few other items with the pizzas too. This place is not in the hospitality business and not trying to serve customers to be profitable. Guess the local Dominos gets more business tonight.

Review: I placed an order for pick up and told ready at 6pm per app. I was late and arrived at 6:30p and told by staff 3-4 minutes. Pizza finally given to me at 6:45p, now 45 minutes after the original time promised and it was the wrong pizza. When pointed out, the cashier answered the phone and ignored me, so I left with the wrong pizza. 
Food has always been good as was this visit, but I will never return!

Review: We love Zio Als!  I always like finding a good non-national chain pizza place to support and this is our go-to local pizza delivery option.

They have quite an extensive menu here, with lots of toppings and pre-made recipes for the pizzas.  My absolute favorites are the Signature Pizza (NY Style Crust, Pepperoni, Beef, Breakfast Bacon, Basil, Sliced Tomatoes and Mozarella) and Spinach Alfredo (Alfredo Sauce, Spinach, and Cheese).  They also have several crust options, including stuffed crust.

We've gotten some of the breadsticks/cheesesticks, apps, and desserts a few times, and they're decent.  It's the pizza itself that keeps us coming back.

Bonus: open late - until 3AM!

Rating: 2 stars
Review: Third time picking up from Zio and will be our last. Tonight we got the hand tossed half Hawaiian and half chicken pesto. Way too much cheese, threw it out of balance. The pesto sauce was very oily and somewhat an off putting taste. Combined with all the cheese, made for a terribly greasy pie. The Hawaiian portion was better. Our first visit was more than a year ago. Got deep dish, weren't fans and didn't plan on a return. A month ago friends ordered a margarita and pepperoni, thin crusts, which were good. You will notice that they offer 5 or 6 different types of crusts. My experience is few places can excel at all. Maybe thin crust is the way to go?

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Best thing about this place, it's open late. Fresh food late at night. 

I had their lemon pepper wings and man... these were huge!!! Extremely crispy and full of flavor. Highly recommend it. I also had their boneless wings with their signature sweet teriyaki sauce, would definitely get that next time except with flats. 

Now pizzas- another great service they offer- you can order half and half so obviously we did just that. 1 small pizza can easily fill up 4 people. We ordered the Buffalo pizza with half BBQ pizza. I liked the BBQ one more compared to buffalo. Second pizza was NY specialty and Meatball lovers. For this one, the sure win was the Meatball lover. Don't get me wrong, they were all great, just the meatball lover was the best. 

If you're in Dallas I would definitely recommend this place.

Review: The night shift worker is extremely rude she wears glasses. I came in one time & she asked me if i was going to tip & but  then she insisted that i didn't have too. Is that what you guys train your employees to do ? The cheesecake here is terrible.  the crust tastes old. Pizza here never looks great compared to the other locations. Im a loyal customer i've been to all the other locations throughout the metroplex . Not sure if this is a real policy but i asked if i could change the size of my pizza & she told me i couldn't because the pizza was in the oven already so if i wanted to get another size i would have to buy another pizza.  This one by far is the worst. If you guys don't mind the drive go to the one in McKinney they are 100x better pizza is amazing !

They were both good and everything was an appropriate warm temperature.  The fries were great,although not a large portion. 

I was highly irritated that if you want to have veggies or anything on it they up charge you for every single thing. It's exactly why i did not* order the wings, if you want any sauce/flavor on it they up charge an additional 99 cents! Insane. 

Service was fine, i ordered online and to go, so interaction was extremely minimal. 

If they stopped nickel and diming on the menu and provided a slightly larger portion to meet the high prices this place would 100% be 5 stars for the sandwiches.

Review: I was in town for 3 weeks on a business trip.  I asked a local friend who had really good authentic pizza?  She very highly recommended Zito Al's and boy I now see why.  I got the loaded meat pizza not one but twice while I was in town.  It was so easy to keep reaching in for another slice I ate the whole large pizza in one sitting each time.  The service was fantastic, and I had the same delivery driver both times and he was awesome, friendly and always on time.  The next time I'm back in the area which will be soon, I know where I'm going for great pizza.

Review: I used to work day in and day out until very late night. Usually by the time I got off from work, every place was closed and I had very limited options on what I wanted to eat then I discovered Zio Als 

This place was the best thing I could've ever discovered for my late night cravings. They have a little bit of everything and it's always prepared fresh. I have never had a bad thing on their menu and I will continue to go here.

Review: My father and I ordered Zio Al's for delivery and it was pretty good. The food came quickly but was very cold (could have been a DoorDash thing). When heated up the pizza was pretty good, but had little to no sauce. It was very dry and had too much cheese. The Chicken Caesar was fresh and plentiful.

I probably wouldn't get it again because I'm only visiting and there's so many other pizza options, but it served its purpose.

Review: Late night grub Zio Al's has you!

After a night out, Zio Al's was the only place pumping out grub. As a first timer, I went with a classic meat pizza .. plentiful in toppings the small was filling. The crust is light and airy, sauce wasn't overpowering. 

The establishment itself isn't big therefore don't expect much outside of good flavors. Late night it can be crowded however wait time for my order wasn't long. Shoutout to Sergio for being great with the service.

Rating: 1 stars
Review: This is anything but authentic Italian food. How do you mess up spaghetti and meatballs even if you don't know Italian cooking? 

I have never had their pizza but it looked good on the table next to us. I would have probably liked anything other than the dish I had.  The smell in the restaurant was very bleach heavy. Not an appetizing smell. I am glad they take cleaning seriously but wow.

Not to be gross, but my stomach did not keep the mush y mess of spaghetti down for long. I had to eject.

Review: Stopped in for a quick bite while in McKinney. The pizza was great, nothing overly amazing. I LOVED the chicken parm, definitely had to add a packet of Parmesan to add a little flavor though. The GARLIC BREAD  is a must haha. Very cute and snazzy place. Open late, the inside seems very clean. Would recommend.

Review: Was told by a friend how amazing this place was.  Ordered a pepperoni and a Hawaiian.  Delivery was well over an hour but may have been an UberEats thing, so okay with that.  However. both pizzas had very little sauce and a lot of cheese.  Both were well overcooked, the pepperoni so bad they were dark and curled up and barely chewable and both had that burnt taste to them.  First order didn't make me a fan... maybe okay for a drunken 2am order?  Guess I will stick with what I know.

Review: So we had several long black hairs embedded into several slices of our pizza last night, which we ordered at 9:40pm. (See photos) Don't get me wrong, we love Zio Al. They were our go-to for pizza. They have an amazing supreme chicken Alfredo pizza and their service is always friendly

Unfortunately, we don't plan to return to any of their locations for a while. Do better, Zio Al. You could have the best pizza in town, so get your quality control in order before it gets worse. Hair is unacceptable

Edit: Sarah from Zio Al reached out to us and apologized, which we appreciated! When a company can take accountability, it really shows they want to improve and put customers first. Something I never see in national pizza chains. 
We hope to return again sometime and leave another, hopefully positive, review when that time comes. No restaurant is perfect, so just be careful. I'm positive this was a rare mistake

Review: I let this pizza place waste an hour of my day and they didn't care! 

I just left and I'm absolutely pissed. I ordered takeout and waited an hour (which was also a little slow on my part but I did anyway)

The chick at the counter kept saying a few more minutes and then i proceeded to watch people who came after me walk in and get their food.

I feel like I was being toyed with and wasn't taken serious. Great pizza but I will never eat here again. 

Let's see if I get this "voucher" I was promised as she wrote my wife's name and number on a sticky note 

I left a pizza place waste an hour of my time today.

Review: The food is good... when they give you your correct order. Here's a hack - order from here on Uber Eats, watch them get your order wrong, and then get a refund for your food and tip a friendly Uber Eats driver. Trust me, it's happened to me 3 times now.

One of the times I ordered a gyro pizza, which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, gyro meat, white sauce, etc. I received a pizza with only gyro meat on it. I don't even know how an employee can allow that to happen. Are you not looking directly at the food at all when closing the pizza box lid?

This time I requested "thin crispy", which is a literal $2 up-charge - and I received a normal pizza. I also requested for the pepperoni to be halal - a $1 up-charge. When they can't pay attention to one modification, how can I trust that they're paying attention to another?? Definitely will not be letting my halal-only parents eat any. 

Tonight Uber Eats notified me that I have ordered from this place six times, I was surprised and disappointed with myself. Disappointed because they've officially gotten 3 out of 6 orders I have placed with them wrong, surprised because I can't believe I let it happen a third time. 

Like I said, if you'll eat whatever they deliver and want to get a refund without lying - apparently 50% of the time this will be your spot.

Review: I used Zio Al's catering for a work event that took place at the Private School where I work. They were extremely helpful from beginning to end. This event was to feed 120 guests who also had dietary restrictions. I was able to share what I was looking for and 2 of their managers Zafnat and Moe ensured that my needs were met. They were communicative via phone, and email, and answered all of my questions. I had never heard of or used Zio Al's, so I did a quick Google search, reviewed their menu, and reached out.  Not only were they affordable, but they were also reliable and the food was tasty!

If you have an event that needs catering, I highly recommend using Zio Al's.

Review: I am sad to say my family will not be ordering from this location ever again. We have been huge fans and loyal customers to this location for the last 3 years. We have ALWAYS ordered delivery and had excellent service from the drivers and employees. Tonight on the later shift, we called to place our normal order and the female that was answering phone was not only rude, but told us they do not deliver to our location. Again, we have been getting delivery from them for 3 years and literally delivered 3 days prior to us. When we asked why and how would that have changed, she said because we live 12 minutes away and they only deliver to 10 minutes away... what an absolute joke. She even said "oh yeah I see you guys order from us a lot.." Her name is Sarah, she needs to be fired. She is causing you to lose loyal customers. We are extremely disappointed as we always order over $60 worth of food and tip the drivers $20. As a store manager myself, I can assure you, Sarah is bad for your business.

Review: Pizza arrived warm but still didn't taste tooo fresh for some reason. The crusts for the pizzas were unevenly cooked and had some doughy parts. Very bread-y pizza so if you like that this is the place to go. 

The cheesy bread was underwhelming, essentially a cheese pizza without sauce and very oily. 
Fries are good but serving size small.

Overall, would not eat here again but it was open on Christmas so that's something.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Cheese sticks - They are hit or miss. Sometimes there's barely any cheese, others it's too much. I still enjoy them.

Wings - They changed their wings in quality and price. The kind they have now are more breaded. They have a nice flavor.

Pizza - The pizza is decent. Way better than chain restaurants for sure. 

All in all it's a nice restaurant. If they make an error or you don't like what you've ordered, they'll accommodate you with no issue. Big bonus they're open until 4am.

Review: Yummy - friends also tried & loved. Dining in or taking out, Zio Al's never disappoints. We have tried pizzas & subs. My favorite is Alfredo with pepperoni. Hubz loves all meat & the meatball sub. Frankly, we will probably go through a majority of the menu since we live so close. 
Salads are salads. This isn't a dig. If any establishment wants to up their game: have at it. For the most part they are all alike unless they have the house dressing made with red sauce. Lettuce is always crunchy water no matter how ya package it. Back to Zio's: getcha a nice greasy slice. Add it to your Yelp. It's with it.

The establishment itself isn't big therefore don't expect much outside of good flavors. Late night it can be crowded however wait time for my order wasn't long. Shoutout to Sergio for being great with the service.

Review: This is anything but authentic Italian food. How do you mess up spaghetti and meatballs even if you don't know Italian cooking? 

I have never had their pizza but it looked good on the table next to us. I would have probably liked anything other than the dish I had.  The smell in the restaurant was very bleach heavy. Not an appetizing smell. I am glad they take cleaning seriously but wow.

Not to be gross, but my stomach did not keep the mush y mess of spaghetti down for long. I had to eject.

Review: Stopped in for a quick bite while in McKinney. The pizza was great, nothing overly amazing. I LOVED the chicken parm, definitely had to add a packet of Parmesan to add a little flavor though. The GARLIC BREAD  is a must haha. Very cute and snazzy place. Open late, the inside seems very clean. Would recommend.

Review: Was told by a friend how amazing this place was.  Ordered a pepperoni and a Hawaiian.  Delivery was well over an hour but may have been an UberEats thing, so okay with that.  However. both pizzas had very little sauce and a lot of cheese.  Both were well overcooked, the pepperoni so bad they were dark and curled up and barely chewable and both had that burnt taste to them.  First order didn't make me a fan... maybe okay for a drunken 2am order?  Guess I will stick with what I know.

Review: So we had several long black hairs embedded into several slices of our pizza last night, which we ordered at 9:40pm. (See photos) Don't get me wrong, we love Zio Al. They were our go-to for pizza. They have an amazing supreme chicken Alfredo pizza and their service is always friendly

Unfortunately, we don't plan to return to any of their locations for a while. Do better, Zio Al. You could have the best pizza in town, so get your quality control in order before it gets worse. Hair is unacceptable

Edit: Sarah from Zio Al reached out to us and apologized, which we appreciated! When a company can take accountability, it really shows they want to improve and put customers first. Something I never see in national pizza chains. 
We hope to return again sometime and leave another, hopefully positive, review when that time comes. No restaurant is perfect, so just be careful. I'm positive this was a rare mistake

Review: I let this pizza place waste an hour of my day and they didn't care! 

I just left and I'm absolutely pissed. I ordered takeout and waited an hour (which was also a little slow on my part but I did anyway)

The chick at the counter kept saying a few more minutes and then i proceeded to watch people who came after me walk in and get their food.

I feel like I was being toyed with and wasn't taken serious. Great pizza but I will never eat here again. 

Let's see if I get this "voucher" I was promised as she wrote my wife's name and number on a sticky note 

I left a pizza place waste an hour of my time today.

Review: The food is good... when they give you your correct order. Here's a hack - order from here on Uber Eats, watch them get your order wrong, and then get a refund for your food and tip a friendly Uber Eats driver. Trust me, it's happened to me 3 times now.

One of the times I ordered a gyro pizza, which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, gyro meat, white sauce, etc. I received a pizza with only gyro meat on it. I don't even know how an employee can allow that to happen. Are you not looking directly at the food at all when closing the pizza box lid?

This time I requested "thin crispy", which is a literal $2 up-charge - and I received a normal pizza. I also requested for the pepperoni to be halal - a $1 up-charge. When they can't pay attention to one modification, how can I trust that they're paying attention to another?? Definitely will not be letting my halal-only parents eat any. 

Tonight Uber Eats notified me that I have ordered from this place six times, I was surprised and disappointed with myself. Disappointed because they've officially gotten 3 out of 6 orders I have placed with them wrong, surprised because I can't believe I let it happen a third time. 

Like I said, if you'll eat whatever they deliver and want to get a refund without lying - apparently 50% of the time this will be your spot.

Review: I used Zio Al's catering for a work event that took place at the Private School where I work. They were extremely helpful from beginning to end. This event was to feed 120 guests who also had dietary restrictions. I was able to share what I was looking for and 2 of their managers Zafnat and Moe ensured that my needs were met. They were communicative via phone, and email, and answered all of my questions. I had never heard of or used Zio Al's, so I did a quick Google search, reviewed their menu, and reached out.  Not only were they affordable, but they were also reliable and the food was tasty!

If you have an event that needs catering, I highly recommend using Zio Al's.

Review: I am sad to say my family will not be ordering from this location ever again. We have been huge fans and loyal customers to this location for the last 3 years. We have ALWAYS ordered delivery and had excellent service from the drivers and employees. Tonight on the later shift, we called to place our normal order and the female that was answering phone was not only rude, but told us they do not deliver to our location. Again, we have been getting delivery from them for 3 years and literally delivered 3 days prior to us. When we asked why and how would that have changed, she said because we live 12 minutes away and they only deliver to 10 minutes away... what an absolute joke. She even said "oh yeah I see you guys order from us a lot.." Her name is Sarah, she needs to be fired. She is causing you to lose loyal customers. We are extremely disappointed as we always order over $60 worth of food and tip the drivers $20. As a store manager myself, I can assure you, Sarah is bad for your business.

Review: Pizza arrived warm but still didn't taste tooo fresh for some reason. The crusts for the pizzas were unevenly cooked and had some doughy parts. Very bread-y pizza so if you like that this is the place to go. 

The cheesy bread was underwhelming, essentially a cheese pizza without sauce and very oily. 
Fries are good but serving size small.

Overall, would not eat here again but it was open on Christmas so that's something.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Cheese sticks - They are hit or miss. Sometimes there's barely any cheese, others it's too much. I still enjoy them.

Wings - They changed their wings in quality and price. The kind they have now are more breaded. They have a nice flavor.

Pizza - The pizza is decent. Way better than chain restaurants for sure. 

All in all it's a nice restaurant. If they make an error or you don't like what you've ordered, they'll accommodate you with no issue. Big bonus they're open until 4am.

Review: Yummy - friends also tried & loved. Dining in or taking out, Zio Al's never disappoints. We have tried pizzas & subs. My favorite is Alfredo with pepperoni. Hubz loves all meat & the meatball sub. Frankly, we will probably go through a majority of the menu since we live so close. 
Salads are salads. This isn't a dig. If any establishment wants to up their game: have at it. For the most part they are all alike unless they have the house dressing made with red sauce. Lettuce is always crunchy water no matter how ya package it. Back to Zio's: getcha a nice greasy slice. Add it to your Yelp. It's with it.

Review: My family was ordering from here at least 1-2x a month.  Stopped going because the last time my wife placed an order over the phone and went to pick up the order, they did not have the order at all.  Seems like the person that took the order never placed it after hanging up.

Mistakes happen and that's fine, but the problem is the person tried to be dismissive and did not acknowledge the problem.  No sorry or anything.

Review: I used to love this place! The last few times I've ordered from this location my food has not been good. It doesn't even look or taste the same like it used to. This is the closest location to me but I would rather drive to the other locations knowing I will be satisfied.

Review: I got this place delivered. I got the gyro pizza, traditional wings (lemon pepper) and the Cesar salad. 

The pizza was decent... they put ALOT of cheese in their pizza. And the crust is really soft so your crusts might stick together when you pull it, not the usual pizza texture you would expect? 

The wings are great but the lemon pepper was VERY SALTY. I think it would have been perfect if it wasn't so salty.

The salad was very average. Overall I think a place worth checking out if you like cheesy pizza! I think their pizza is the selling point.

Review: They could not make a pizza without cheese due to a food allergy. That is unfortunate since we were from out of town and wanted to order pizzas for our family...among a few other items with the pizzas too. This place is not in the hospitality business and not trying to serve customers to be profitable. Guess the local Dominos gets more business tonight.

Review: I placed an order for pick up and told ready at 6pm per app. I was late and arrived at 6:30p and told by staff 3-4 minutes. Pizza finally given to me at 6:45p, now 45 minutes after the original time promised and it was the wrong pizza. When pointed out, the cashier answered the phone and ignored me, so I left with the wrong pizza. 
Food has always been good as was this visit, but I will never return!

Review: We love Zio Als!  I always like finding a good non-national chain pizza place to support and this is our go-to local pizza delivery option.

They have quite an extensive menu here, with lots of toppings and pre-made recipes for the pizzas.  My absolute favorites are the Signature Pizza (NY Style Crust, Pepperoni, Beef, Breakfast Bacon, Basil, Sliced Tomatoes and Mozarella) and Spinach Alfredo (Alfredo Sauce, Spinach, and Cheese).  They also have several crust options, including stuffed crust.

We've gotten some of the breadsticks/cheesesticks, apps, and desserts a few times, and they're decent.  It's the pizza itself that keeps us coming back.

Bonus: open late - until 3AM!

Review: Third time picking up from Zio and will be our last. Tonight we got the hand tossed half Hawaiian and half chicken pesto. Way too much cheese, threw it out of balance. The pesto sauce was very oily and somewhat an off putting taste. Combined with all the cheese, made for a terribly greasy pie. The Hawaiian portion was better. Our first visit was more than a year ago. Got deep dish, weren't fans and didn't plan on a return. A month ago friends ordered a margarita and pepperoni, thin crusts, which were good. You will notice that they offer 5 or 6 different types of crusts. My experience is few places can excel at all. Maybe thin crust is the way to go?

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Best thing about this place, it's open late. Fresh food late at night. 

I had their lemon pepper wings and man... these were huge!!! Extremely crispy and full of flavor. Highly recommend it. I also had their boneless wings with their signature sweet teriyaki sauce, would definitely get that next time except with flats. 

Now pizzas- another great service they offer- you can order half and half so obviously we did just that. 1 small pizza can easily fill up 4 people. We ordered the Buffalo pizza with half BBQ pizza. I liked the BBQ one more compared to buffalo. Second pizza was NY specialty and Meatball lovers. For this one, the sure win was the Meatball lover. Don't get me wrong, they were all great, just the meatball lover was the best. 

If you're in Dallas I would definitely recommend this place.

Review: The night shift worker is extremely rude she wears glasses. I came in one time & she asked me if i was going to tip & but  then she insisted that i didn't have too. Is that what you guys train your employees to do ? The cheesecake here is terrible.  the crust tastes old. Pizza here never looks great compared to the other locations. Im a loyal customer i've been to all the other locations throughout the metroplex . Not sure if this is a real policy but i asked if i could change the size of my pizza & she told me i couldn't because the pizza was in the oven already so if i wanted to get another size i would have to buy another pizza.  This one by far is the worst. If you guys don't mind the drive go to the one in McKinney they are 100x better pizza is amazing !

Review: We ordered the meatball sandwich and the chicken club. 
They were both good and everything was an appropriate warm temperature.  The fries were great,although not a large portion. 

I was highly irritated that if you want to have veggies or anything on it they up charge you for every single thing. It's exactly why i did not* order the wings, if you want any sauce/flavor on it they up charge an additional 99 cents! Insane. 

Service was fine, i ordered online and to go, so interaction was extremely minimal. 

If they stopped nickel and diming on the menu and provided a slightly larger portion to meet the high prices this place would 100% be 5 stars for the sandwiches.

Review: I was in town for 3 weeks on a business trip.  I asked a local friend who had really good authentic pizza?  She very highly recommended Zito Al's and boy I now see why.  I got the loaded meat pizza not one but twice while I was in town.  It was so easy to keep reaching in for another slice I ate the whole large pizza in one sitting each time.  The service was fantastic, and I had the same delivery driver both times and he was awesome, friendly and always on time.  The next time I'm back in the area which will be soon, I know where I'm going for great pizza.

Review: My father and I ordered Zio Al's for delivery and it was pretty good. The food came quickly but was very cold (could have been a DoorDash thing). When heated up the pizza was pretty good, but had little to no sauce. It was very dry and had too much cheese. The Chicken Caesar was fresh and plentiful.

I probably wouldn't get it again because I'm only visiting and there's so many other pizza options, but it served its purpose.

Review: They could not make a pizza without cheese due to a food allergy. That is unfortunate since we were from out of town and wanted to order pizzas for our family...among a few other items with the pizzas too. This place is not in the hospitality business and not trying to serve customers to be profitable. Guess the local Dominos gets more business tonight.

Review: I placed an order for pick up and told ready at 6pm per app. I was late and arrived at 6:30p and told by staff 3-4 minutes. Pizza finally given to me at 6:45p, now 45 minutes after the original time promised and it was the wrong pizza. When pointed out, the cashier answered the phone and ignored me, so I left with the wrong pizza. 
Food has always been good as was this visit, but I will never return!

Review: We love Zio Als!  I always like finding a good non-national chain pizza place to support and this is our go-to local pizza delivery option.

They have quite an extensive menu here, with lots of toppings and pre-made recipes for the pizzas.  My absolute favorites are the Signature Pizza (NY Style Crust, Pepperoni, Beef, Breakfast Bacon, Basil, Sliced Tomatoes and Mozarella) and Spinach Alfredo (Alfredo Sauce, Spinach, and Cheese).  They also have several crust options, including stuffed crust.

We've gotten some of the breadsticks/cheesesticks, apps, and desserts a few times, and they're decent.  It's the pizza itself that keeps us coming back.

Bonus: open late - until 3AM!

Rating: 2 stars
Review: Third time picking up from Zio and will be our last. Tonight we got the hand tossed half Hawaiian and half chicken pesto. Way too much cheese, threw it out of balance. The pesto sauce was very oily and somewhat an off putting taste. Combined with all the cheese, made for a terribly greasy pie. The Hawaiian portion was better. Our first visit was more than a year ago. Got deep dish, weren't fans and didn't plan on a return. A month ago friends ordered a margarita and pepperoni, thin crusts, which were good. You will notice that they offer 5 or 6 different types of crusts. My experience is few places can excel at all. Maybe thin crust is the way to go?

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Best thing about this place, it's open late. Fresh food late at night. 

I had their lemon pepper wings and man... these were huge!!! Extremely crispy and full of flavor. Highly recommend it. I also had their boneless wings with their signature sweet teriyaki sauce, would definitely get that next time except with flats. 

Now pizzas- another great service they offer- you can order half and half so obviously we did just that. 1 small pizza can easily fill up 4 people. We ordered the Buffalo pizza with half BBQ pizza. I liked the BBQ one more compared to buffalo. Second pizza was NY specialty and Meatball lovers. For this one, the sure win was the Meatball lover. Don't get me wrong, they were all great, just the meatball lover was the best. 

If you're in Dallas I would definitely recommend this place.

Review: The night shift worker is extremely rude she wears glasses. I came in one time & she asked me if i was going to tip & but  then she insisted that i didn't have too. Is that what you guys train your employees to do ? The cheesecake here is terrible.  the crust tastes old. Pizza here never looks great compared to the other locations. Im a loyal customer i've been to all the other locations throughout the metroplex . Not sure if this is a real policy but i asked if i could change the size of my pizza & she told me i couldn't because the pizza was in the oven already so if i wanted to get another size i would have to buy another pizza.  This one by far is the worst. If you guys don't mind the drive go to the one in McKinney they are 100x better pizza is amazing !

Review: We ordered the meatball sandwich and the chicken club. 
They were both good and everything was an appropriate warm temperature.  The fries were great,although not a large portion. 

I was highly irritated that if you want to have veggies or anything on it they up charge you for every single thing. It's exactly why i did not* order the wings, if you want any sauce/flavor on it they up charge an additional 99 cents! Insane. 

Service was fine, i ordered online and to go, so interaction was extremely minimal. 

If they stopped nickel and diming on the menu and provided a slightly larger portion to meet the high prices this place would 100% be 5 stars for the sandwiches.

Review: I was in town for 3 weeks on a business trip.  I asked a local friend who had really good authentic pizza?  She very highly recommended Zito Al's and boy I now see why.  I got the loaded meat pizza not one but twice while I was in town.  It was so easy to keep reaching in for another slice I ate the whole large pizza in one sitting each time.  The service was fantastic, and I had the same delivery driver both times and he was awesome, friendly and always on time.  The next time I'm back in the area which will be soon, I know where I'm going for great pizza.

Review: I used to work day in and day out until very late night. Usually by the time I got off from work, every place was closed and I had very limited options on what I wanted to eat then I discovered Zio Als 

This place was the best thing I could've ever discovered for my late night cravings. They have a little bit of everything and it's always prepared fresh. I have never had a bad thing on their menu and I will continue to go here.

Review: My father and I ordered Zio Al's for delivery and it was pretty good. The food came quickly but was very cold (could have been a DoorDash thing). When heated up the pizza was pretty good, but had little to no sauce. It was very dry and had too much cheese. The Chicken Caesar was fresh and plentiful.

I probably wouldn't get it again because I'm only visiting and there's so many other pizza options, but it served its purpose.

Review: Late night grub Zio Al's has you!

After a night out, Zio Al's was the only place pumping out grub. As a first timer, I went with a classic meat pizza .. plentiful in toppings the small was filling. The crust is light and airy, sauce wasn't overpowering. 

The establishment itself isn't big therefore don't expect much outside of good flavors. Late night it can be crowded however wait time for my order wasn't long. Shoutout to Sergio for being great with the service.

Review: This is anything but authentic Italian food. How do you mess up spaghetti and meatballs even if you don't know Italian cooking? 

I have never had their pizza but it looked good on the table next to us. I would have probably liked anything other than the dish I had.  The smell in the restaurant was very bleach heavy. Not an appetizing smell. I am glad they take cleaning seriously but wow.

Not to be gross, but my stomach did not keep the mush y mess of spaghetti down for long. I had to eject.

Review: Stopped in for a quick bite while in McKinney. The pizza was great, nothing overly amazing. I LOVED the chicken parm, definitely had to add a packet of Parmesan to add a little flavor though.

Review: Was told by a friend how amazing this place was.  Ordered a pepperoni and a Hawaiian.  Delivery was well over an hour but may have been an UberEats thing, so okay with that.  However. both pizzas had very little sauce and a lot of cheese.  Both were well overcooked, the pepperoni so bad they were dark and curled up and barely chewable and both had that burnt taste to them.  First order didn't make me a fan... maybe okay for a drunken 2am order?  Guess I will stick with what I know.

Review: So we had several long black hairs embedded into several slices of our pizza last night, which we ordered at 9:40pm. (See photos) Don't get me wrong, we love Zio Al. They were our go-to for pizza. They have an amazing supreme chicken Alfredo pizza and their service is always friendly

Unfortunately, we don't plan to return to any of their locations for a while. Do better, Zio Al. You could have the best pizza in town, so get your quality control in order before it gets worse. Hair is unacceptable

Edit: Sarah from Zio Al reached out to us and apologized, which we appreciated! When a company can take accountability, it really shows they want to improve and put customers first. Something I never see in national pizza chains. 
We hope to return again sometime and leave another, hopefully positive, review when that time comes. No restaurant is perfect, so just be careful. I'm positive this was a rare mistake

Review: I let this pizza place waste an hour of my day and they didn't care! 

I just left and I'm absolutely pissed. I ordered takeout and waited an hour (which was also a little slow on my part but I did anyway)

The chick at the counter kept saying a few more minutes and then i proceeded to watch people who came after me walk in and get their food.

I feel like I was being toyed with and wasn't taken serious. Great pizza but I will never eat here again. 

Let's see if I get this "voucher" I was promised as she wrote my wife's name and number on a sticky note 

I left a pizza place waste an hour of my time today.

Review: The food is good... when they give you your correct order. Here's a hack - order from here on Uber Eats, watch them get your order wrong, and then get a refund for your food and tip a friendly Uber Eats driver. Trust me, it's happened to me 3 times now.

One of the times I ordered a gyro pizza, which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, gyro meat, white sauce, etc. I received a pizza with only gyro meat on it. I don't even know how an employee can allow that to happen. Are you not looking directly at the food at all when closing the pizza box lid?

This time I requested "thin crispy", which is a literal $2 up-charge - and I received a normal pizza. I also requested for the pepperoni to be halal - a $1 up-charge. When they can't pay attention to one modification, how can I trust that they're paying attention to another?? Definitely will not be letting my halal-only parents eat any. 

Tonight Uber Eats notified me that I have ordered from this place six times, I was surprised and disappointed with myself. Disappointed because they've officially gotten 3 out of 6 orders I have placed with them wrong, surprised because I can't believe I let it happen a third time. 

Like I said, if you'll eat whatever they deliver and want to get a refund without lying - apparently 50% of the time this will be your spot.

Review: I used Zio Al's catering for a work event that took place at the Private School where I work. They were extremely helpful from beginning to end. This event was to feed 120 guests who also had dietary restrictions. I was able to share what I was looking for and 2 of their managers Zafnat and Moe ensured that my needs were met. They were communicative via phone, and email, and answered all of my questions. I had never heard of or used Zio Al's, so I did a quick Google search, reviewed their menu, and reached out.  Not only were they affordable, but they were also reliable and the food was tasty!

If you have an event that needs catering, I highly recommend using Zio Al's.

Review: I am sad to say my family will not be ordering from this location ever again. We have been huge fans and loyal customers to this location for the last 3 years. We have ALWAYS ordered delivery and had excellent service from the drivers and employees. Tonight on the later shift, we called to place our normal order and the female that was answering phone was not only rude, but told us they do not deliver to our location. Again, we have been getting delivery from them for 3 years and literally delivered 3 days prior to us. When we asked why and how would that have changed, she said because we live 12 minutes away and they only deliver to 10 minutes away... what an absolute joke. She even said "oh yeah I see you guys order from us a lot.." Her name is Sarah, she needs to be fired. She is causing you to lose loyal customers. We are extremely disappointed as we always order over $60 worth of food and tip the drivers $20. As a store manager myself, I can assure you, Sarah is bad for your business.

Review: Pizza arrived warm but still didn't taste tooo fresh for some reason. The crusts for the pizzas were unevenly cooked and had some doughy parts. Very bread-y pizza so if you like that this is the place to go. 

The cheesy bread was underwhelming, essentially a cheese pizza without sauce and very oily. 
Fries are good but serving size small.

Overall, would not eat here again but it was open on Christmas so that's something.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Cheese sticks - They are hit or miss. Sometimes there's barely any cheese, others it's too much. I still enjoy them.

Wings - They changed their wings in quality and price. The kind they have now are more breaded. They have a nice flavor.

Pizza - The pizza is decent. Way better than chain restaurants for sure. 

All in all it's a nice restaurant. If they make an error or you don't like what you've ordered, they'll accommodate you with no issue. Big bonus they're open until 4am.

Review: Yummy - friends also tried & loved. Dining in or taking out, Zio Al's never disappoints. We have tried pizzas & subs. My favorite is Alfredo with pepperoni. Hubz loves all meat & the meatball sub. Frankly, we will probably go through a majority of the menu since we live so close. 
Salads are salads. This isn't a dig. If any establishment wants to up their game: have at it. For the most part they are all alike unless they have the house dressing made with red sauce. Lettuce is always crunchy water no matter how ya package it. Back to Zio's: getcha a nice greasy slice. Add it to your Yelp. It's with it.

Review: My family was ordering from here at least 1-2x a month.  Stopped going because the last time my wife placed an order over the phone and went to pick up the order, they did not have the order at all.  Seems like the person that took the order never placed it after hanging up.

Mistakes happen and that's fine, but the problem is the person tried to be dismissive and did not acknowledge the problem.  No sorry or anything.

The pizza was decent... they put ALOT of cheese in their pizza. And the crust is really soft so your crusts might stick together when you pull it, not the usual pizza texture you would expect?

Review: Was told by a friend how amazing this place was.  Ordered a pepperoni and a Hawaiian.  Delivery was well over an hour but may have been an UberEats thing, so okay with that.  However. both pizzas had very little sauce and a lot of cheese.  Both were well overcooked, the pepperoni so bad they were dark and curled up and barely chewable and both had that burnt taste to them.  First order didn't make me a fan... maybe okay for a drunken 2am order?  Guess I will stick with what I know.

Review: So we had several long black hairs embedded into several slices of our pizza last night, which we ordered at 9:40pm. (See photos) Don't get me wrong, we love Zio Al. They were our go-to for pizza. They have an amazing supreme chicken Alfredo pizza and their service is always friendly

Unfortunately, we don't plan to return to any of their locations for a while. Do better, Zio Al. You could have the best pizza in town, so get your quality control in order before it gets worse. Hair is unacceptable

Edit: Sarah from Zio Al reached out to us and apologized, which we appreciated! When a company can take accountability, it really shows they want to improve and put customers first. Something I never see in national pizza chains. 
We hope to return again sometime and leave another, hopefully positive, review when that time comes. No restaurant is perfect, so just be careful. I'm positive this was a rare mistake

Review: I let this pizza place waste an hour of my day and they didn't care! 

I just left and I'm absolutely pissed. I ordered takeout and waited an hour (which was also a little slow on my part but I did anyway)

The chick at the counter kept saying a few more minutes and then i proceeded to watch people who came after me walk in and get their food.

I feel like I was being toyed with and wasn't taken serious. Great pizza but I will never eat here again. 

Let's see if I get this "voucher" I was promised as she wrote my wife's name and number on a sticky note 

I left a pizza place waste an hour of my time today.

Review: The food is good... when they give you your correct order. Here's a hack - order from here on Uber Eats, watch them get your order wrong, and then get a refund for your food and tip a friendly Uber Eats driver. Trust me, it's happened to me 3 times now.

One of the times I ordered a gyro pizza, which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, gyro meat, white sauce, etc. I received a pizza with only gyro meat on it. I don't even know how an employee can allow that to happen. Are you not looking directly at the food at all when closing the pizza box lid?

This time I requested "thin crispy", which is a literal $2 up-charge - and I received a normal pizza. I also requested for the pepperoni to be halal - a $1 up-charge. When they can't pay attention to one modification, how can I trust that they're paying attention to another?? Definitely will not be letting my halal-only parents eat any. 

Tonight Uber Eats notified me that I have ordered from this place six times, I was surprised and disappointed with myself. Disappointed because they've officially gotten 3 out of 6 orders I have placed with them wrong, surprised because I can't believe I let it happen a third time. 

Like I said, if you'll eat whatever they deliver and want to get a refund without lying - apparently 50% of the time this will be your spot.

Review: I used Zio Al's catering for a work event that took place at the Private School where I work. They were extremely helpful from beginning to end. This event was to feed 120 guests who also had dietary restrictions. I was able to share what I was looking for and 2 of their managers Zafnat and Moe ensured that my needs were met. They were communicative via phone, and email, and answered all of my questions. I had never heard of or used Zio Al's, so I did a quick Google search, reviewed their menu, and reached out.  Not only were they affordable, but they were also reliable and the food was tasty!

If you have an event that needs catering, I highly recommend using Zio Al's.

Review: I am sad to say my family will not be ordering from this location ever again. We have been huge fans and loyal customers to this location for the last 3 years. We have ALWAYS ordered delivery and had excellent service from the drivers and employees. Tonight on the later shift, we called to place our normal order and the female that was answering phone was not only rude, but told us they do not deliver to our location. Again, we have been getting delivery from them for 3 years and literally delivered 3 days prior to us. When we asked why and how would that have changed, she said because we live 12 minutes away and they only deliver to 10 minutes away... what an absolute joke. She even said "oh yeah I see you guys order from us a lot.." Her name is Sarah, she needs to be fired. She is causing you to lose loyal customers. We are extremely disappointed as we always order over $60 worth of food and tip the drivers $20. As a store manager myself, I can assure you, Sarah is bad for your business.

Review: Pizza arrived warm but still didn't taste tooo fresh for some reason. The crusts for the pizzas were unevenly cooked and had some doughy parts. Very bread-y pizza so if you like that this is the place to go. 

The cheesy bread was underwhelming, essentially a cheese pizza without sauce and very oily. 
Fries are good but serving size small.

Overall, would not eat here again but it was open on Christmas so that's something.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Cheese sticks - They are hit or miss. Sometimes there's barely any cheese, others it's too much. I still enjoy them.

Wings - They changed their wings in quality and price. The kind they have now are more breaded. They have a nice flavor.

Pizza - The pizza is decent. Way better than chain restaurants for sure. 

All in all it's a nice restaurant. If they make an error or you don't like what you've ordered, they'll accommodate you with no issue. Big bonus they're open until 4am.

Review: Yummy - friends also tried & loved. Dining in or taking out, Zio Al's never disappoints. We have tried pizzas & subs. My favorite is Alfredo with pepperoni. Hubz loves all meat & the meatball sub. Frankly, we will probably go through a majority of the menu since we live so close. 
Salads are salads. This isn't a dig. If any establishment wants to up their game: have at it. For the most part they are all alike unless they have the house dressing made with red sauce. Lettuce is always crunchy water no matter how ya package it. Back to Zio's: getcha a nice greasy slice. Add it to your Yelp. It's with it.

Review: My family was ordering from here at least 1-2x a month.  Stopped going because the last time my wife placed an order over the phone and went to pick up the order, they did not have the order at all.  Seems like the person that took the order never placed it after hanging up.

Mistakes happen and that's fine, but the problem is the person tried to be dismissive and did not acknowledge the problem.  No sorry or anything.

Review: I got this place delivered. I got the gyro pizza, traditional wings (lemon pepper) and the Cesar salad. 

The pizza was decent... they put ALOT of cheese in their pizza. And the crust is really soft so your crusts might stick together when you pull it, not the usual pizza texture you would expect? 

The wings are great but the lemon pepper was VERY SALTY. I think it would have been perfect if it wasn't so salty.

The salad was very average. Overall I think a place worth checking out if you like cheesy pizza! I think their pizza is the selling point.

That is unfortunate since we were from out of town and wanted to order pizzas for our family...among a few other items with the pizzas too.

Review: I placed an order for pick up and told ready at 6pm per app. I was late and arrived at 6:30p and told by staff 3-4 minutes. Pizza finally given to me at 6:45p, now 45 minutes after the original time promised and it was the wrong pizza. When pointed out, the cashier answered the phone and ignored me, so I left with the wrong pizza. 
Food has always been good as was this visit, but I will never return!

Review: We love Zio Als!  I always like finding a good non-national chain pizza place to support and this is our go-to local pizza delivery option.

They have quite an extensive menu here, with lots of toppings and pre-made recipes for the pizzas.  My absolute favorites are the Signature Pizza (NY Style Crust, Pepperoni, Beef, Breakfast Bacon, Basil, Sliced Tomatoes and Mozarella) and Spinach Alfredo (Alfredo Sauce, Spinach, and Cheese).  They also have several crust options, including stuffed crust.

We've gotten some of the breadsticks/cheesesticks, apps, and desserts a few times, and they're decent.  It's the pizza itself that keeps us coming back.

Bonus: open late - until 3AM!

Rating: 2 stars
Review: Third time picking up from Zio and will be our last. Tonight we got the hand tossed half Hawaiian and half chicken pesto. Way too much cheese, threw it out of balance. The pesto sauce was very oily and somewhat an off putting taste. Combined with all the cheese, made for a terribly greasy pie. The Hawaiian portion was better. Our first visit was more than a year ago. Got deep dish, weren't fans and didn't plan on a return. A month ago friends ordered a margarita and pepperoni, thin crusts, which were good. You will notice that they offer 5 or 6 different types of crusts. My experience is few places can excel at all. Maybe thin crust is the way to go?

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Best thing about this place, it's open late. Fresh food late at night. 

I had their lemon pepper wings and man... these were huge!!! Extremely crispy and full of flavor. Highly recommend it. I also had their boneless wings with their signature sweet teriyaki sauce, would definitely get that next time except with flats. 

Now pizzas- another great service they offer- you can order half and half so obviously we did just that. 1 small pizza can easily fill up 4 people. We ordered the Buffalo pizza with half BBQ pizza. I liked the BBQ one more compared to buffalo. Second pizza was NY specialty and Meatball lovers. For this one, the sure win was the Meatball lover. Don't get me wrong, they were all great, just the meatball lover was the best. 

If you're in Dallas I would definitely recommend this place.

Review: The night shift worker is extremely rude she wears glasses. I came in one time & she asked me if i was going to tip & but  then she insisted that i didn't have too. Is that what you guys train your employees to do ? The cheesecake here is terrible.  the crust tastes old. Pizza here never looks great compared to the other locations. Im a loyal customer i've been to all the other locations throughout the metroplex . Not sure if this is a real policy but i asked if i could change the size of my pizza & she told me i couldn't because the pizza was in the oven already so if i wanted to get another size i would have to buy another pizza.  This one by far is the worst. If you guys don't mind the drive go to the one in McKinney they are 100x better pizza is amazing !

Review: We ordered the meatball sandwich and the chicken club. 
They were both good and everything was an appropriate warm temperature.  The fries were great,although not a large portion. 

I was highly irritated that if you want to have veggies or anything on it they up charge you for every single thing. It's exactly why i did not* order the wings, if you want any sauce/flavor on it they up charge an additional 99 cents! Insane. 

Service was fine, i ordered online and to go, so interaction was extremely minimal. 

If they stopped nickel and diming on the menu and provided a slightly larger portion to meet the high prices this place would 100% be 5 stars for the sandwiches.

Review: I was in town for 3 weeks on a business trip.  I asked a local friend who had really good authentic pizza?  She very highly recommended Zito Al's and boy I now see why.  I got the loaded meat pizza not one but twice while I was in town.  It was so easy to keep reaching in for another slice I ate the whole large pizza in one sitting each time.  The service was fantastic, and I had the same delivery driver both times and he was awesome, friendly and always on time.  The next time I'm back in the area which will be soon, I know where I'm going for great pizza.

Review: My father and I ordered Zio Al's for delivery and it was pretty good. The food came quickly but was very cold (could have been a DoorDash thing). When heated up the pizza was pretty good, but had little to no sauce. It was very dry and had too much cheese. The Chicken Caesar was fresh and plentiful.

I probably wouldn't get it again because I'm only visiting and there's so many other pizza options, but it served its purpose.

Review: Late night grub Zio Al's has you!

After a night out, Zio Al's was the only place pumping out grub. As a first timer, I went with a classic meat pizza .. plentiful in toppings the small was filling. The crust is light and airy, sauce wasn't overpowering. 

The establishment itself isn't big therefore don't expect much outside of good flavors. Late night it can be crowded however wait time for my order wasn't long. Shoutout to Sergio for being great with the service.

Review: This is anything but authentic Italian food. How do you mess up spaghetti and meatballs even if you don't know Italian cooking? 

I have never had their pizza but it looked good on the table next to us. I would have probably liked anything other than the dish I had.  The smell in the restaurant was very bleach heavy. Not an appetizing smell. I am glad they take cleaning seriously but wow.

Not to be gross, but my stomach did not keep the mush y mess of spaghetti down for long. I had to eject.

Food has always been good as was this visit, but I will never return!

Review: We love Zio Als!  I always like finding a good non-national chain pizza place to support and this is our go-to local pizza delivery option.

They have quite an extensive menu here, with lots of toppings and pre-made recipes for the pizzas.  My absolute favorites are the Signature Pizza (NY Style Crust, Pepperoni, Beef, Breakfast Bacon, Basil, Sliced Tomatoes and Mozarella) and Spinach Alfredo (Alfredo Sauce, Spinach, and Cheese).  They also have several crust options, including stuffed crust.

We've gotten some of the breadsticks/cheesesticks, apps, and desserts a few times, and they're decent.  It's the pizza itself that keeps us coming back.

Bonus: open late - until 3AM!

Review: Third time picking up from Zio and will be our last. Tonight we got the hand tossed half Hawaiian and half chicken pesto. Way too much cheese, threw it out of balance. The pesto sauce was very oily and somewhat an off putting taste. Combined with all the cheese, made for a terribly greasy pie. The Hawaiian portion was better. Our first visit was more than a year ago. Got deep dish, weren't fans and didn't plan on a return. A month ago friends ordered a margarita and pepperoni, thin crusts, which were good. You will notice that they offer 5 or 6 different types of crusts. My experience is few places can excel at all. Maybe thin crust is the way to go?

Rating: 5 stars
Review: Best thing about this place, it's open late. Fresh food late at night. 

I had their lemon pepper wings and man... these were huge!!! Extremely crispy and full of flavor. Highly recommend it. I also had their boneless wings with their signature sweet teriyaki sauce, would definitely get that next time except with flats. 

Now pizzas- another great service they offer- you can order half and half so obviously we did just that. 1 small pizza can easily fill up 4 people. We ordered the Buffalo pizza with half BBQ pizza. I liked the BBQ one more compared to buffalo. Second pizza was NY specialty and Meatball lovers. For this one, the sure win was the Meatball lover. Don't get me wrong, they were all great, just the meatball lover was the best. 

If you're in Dallas I would definitely recommend this place.

Review: The night shift worker is extremely rude she wears glasses. I came in one time & she asked me if i was going to tip & but  then she insisted that i didn't have too. Is that what you guys train your employees to do ? The cheesecake here is terrible.  the crust tastes old. Pizza here never looks great compared to the other locations. Im a loyal customer i've been to all the other locations throughout the metroplex . Not sure if this is a real policy but i asked if i could change the size of my pizza & she told me i couldn't because the pizza was in the oven already so if i wanted to get another size i would have to buy another pizza.  This one by far is the worst. If you guys don't mind the drive go to the one in McKinney they are 100x better pizza is amazing !

Review: We ordered the meatball sandwich and the chicken club. 
They were both good and everything was an appropriate warm temperature.  The fries were great,although not a large portion. 

I was highly irritated that if you want to have veggies or anything on it they up charge you for every single thing. It's exactly why i did not* order the wings, if you want any sauce/flavor on it they up charge an additional 99 cents! Insane. 

Service was fine, i ordered online and to go, so interaction was extremely minimal. 

If they stopped nickel and diming on the menu and provided a slightly larger portion to meet the high prices this place would 100% be 5 stars for the sandwiches.

Review: I was in town for 3 weeks on a business trip.  I asked a local friend who had really good authentic pizza?  She very highly recommended Zito Al's and boy I now see why.  I got the loaded meat pizza not one but twice while I was in town.  It was so easy to keep reaching in for another slice I ate the whole large pizza in one sitting each time.  The service was fantastic, and I had the same delivery driver both times and he was awesome, friendly and always on time.  The next time I'm back in the area which will be soon, I know where I'm going for great pizza.

Review: I used to work day in and day out until very late night. Usually by the time I got off from work, every place was closed and I had very limited options on what I wanted to eat then I discovered Zio Als 

This place was the best thing I could've ever discovered for my late night cravings. They have a little bit of everything and it's always prepared fresh. I have never had a bad thing on their menu and I will continue to go here.

Review: My father and I ordered Zio Al's for delivery and it was pretty good. The food came quickly but was very cold (could have been a DoorDash thing). When heated up the pizza was pretty good, but had little to no sauce. It was very dry and had too much cheese. The Chicken Caesar was fresh and plentiful.

I probably wouldn't get it again because I'm only visiting and there's so many other pizza options, but it served its purpose.

Review: Late night grub Zio Al's has you!

After a night out, Zio Al's was the only place pumping out grub. As a first timer, I went with a classic meat pizza .. plentiful in toppings the small was filling. The crust is light and airy, sauce wasn't overpowering. 

The establishment itself isn't big therefore don't expect much outside of good flavors. Late night it can be crowded however wait time for my order wasn't long. Shoutout to Sergio for being great with the service.

Review: This is anything but authentic Italian food. How do you mess up spaghetti and meatballs even if you don't know Italian cooking? 

I have never had their pizza but it looked good on the table next to us. I would have probably liked anything other than the dish I had.  The smell in the restaurant was very bleach heavy. Not an appetizing smell. I am glad they take cleaning seriously but wow.

Not to be gross, but my stomach did not keep the mush y mess of spaghetti down for long. I had to eject.

Review: Stopped in for a quick bite while in McKinney. The pizza was great, nothing overly amazing. I LOVED the chicken parm, definitely had to add a packet of Parmesan to add a little flavor though.

Review: Was told by a friend how amazing this place was.  Ordered a pepperoni and a Hawaiian.  Delivery was well over an hour but may have been an UberEats thing, so okay with that.  However. both pizzas had very little sauce and a lot of cheese.  Both were well overcooked, the pepperoni so bad they were dark and curled up and barely chewable and both had that burnt taste to them.  First order didn't make me a fan... maybe okay for a drunken 2am order?  Guess I will stick with what I know.

Review: So we had several long black hairs embedded into several slices of our pizza last night, which we ordered at 9:40pm. (See photos) Don't get me wrong, we love Zio Al. They were our go-to for pizza. They have an amazing supreme chicken Alfredo pizza and their service is always friendly

Unfortunately, we don't plan to return to any of their locations for a while. Do better, Zio Al. You could have the best pizza in town, so get your quality control in order before it gets worse. Hair is unacceptable

Edit: Sarah from Zio Al reached out to us and apologized, which we appreciated! When a company can take accountability, it really shows they want to improve and put customers first. Something I never see in national pizza chains. 
We hope to return again sometime and leave another, hopefully positive, review when that time comes. No restaurant is perfect, so just be careful. I'm positive this was a rare mistake

Review: I let this pizza place waste an hour of my day and they didn't care! 

I just left and I'm absolutely pissed. I ordered takeout and waited an hour (which was also a little slow on my part but I did anyway)

The chick at the counter kept saying a few more minutes and then i proceeded to watch people who came after me walk in and get their food.

I feel like I was being toyed with and wasn't taken serious. Great pizza but I will never eat here again. 

Let's see if I get this "voucher" I was promised as she wrote my wife's name and number on a sticky note 

I left a pizza place waste an hour of my time today.

Review: The food is good... when they give you your correct order. Here's a hack - order from here on Uber Eats, watch them get your order wrong, and then get a refund for your food and tip a friendly Uber Eats driver. Trust me, it's happened to me 3 times now.

One of the times I ordered a gyro pizza, which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, gyro meat, white sauce, etc. I received a pizza with only gyro meat on it. I don't even know how an employee can allow that to happen. Are you not looking directly at the food at all when closing the pizza box lid?

This time I requested "thin crispy", which is a literal $2 up-charge - and I received a normal pizza. I also requested for the pepperoni to be halal - a $1 up-charge. When they can't pay attention to one modification, how can I trust that they're paying attention to another?? Definitely will not be letting my halal-only parents eat any. 

Tonight Uber Eats notified me that I have ordered from this place six times, I was surprised and disappointed with myself. Disappointed because they've officially gotten 3 out of 6 orders I have placed with them wrong, surprised because I can't believe I let it happen a third time. 

Like I said, if you'll eat whatever they deliver and want to get a refund without lying - apparently 50% of the time this will be your spot.

Review: I used Zio Al's catering for a work event that took place at the Private School where I work. They were extremely helpful from beginning to end. This event was to feed 120 guests who also had dietary restrictions. I was able to share what I was looking for and 2 of their managers Zafnat and Moe ensured that my needs were met. They were communicative via phone, and email, and answered all of my questions. I had never heard of or used Zio Al's, so I did a quick Google search, reviewed their menu, and reached out.  Not only were they affordable, but they were also reliable and the food was tasty!

If you have an event that needs catering, I highly recommend using Zio Al's.

Review: I am sad to say my family will not be ordering from this location ever again. We have been huge fans and loyal customers to this location for the last 3 years. We have ALWAYS ordered delivery and had excellent service from the drivers and employees. Tonight on the later shift, we called to place our normal order and the female that was answering phone was not only rude, but told us they do not deliver to our location. Again, we have been getting delivery from them for 3 years and literally delivered 3 days prior to us. When we asked why and how would that have changed, she said because we live 12 minutes away and they only deliver to 10 minutes away... what an absolute joke. She even said "oh yeah I see you guys order from us a lot.." Her name is Sarah, she needs to be fired. She is causing you to lose loyal customers. We are extremely disappointed as we always order over $60 worth of food and tip the drivers $20. As a store manager myself, I can assure you, Sarah is bad for your business.

Review: Pizza arrived warm but still didn't taste tooo fresh for some reason. The crusts for the pizzas were unevenly cooked and had some doughy parts. Very bread-y pizza so if you like that this is the place to go. 

The cheesy bread was underwhelming, essentially a cheese pizza without sauce and very oily. 
Fries are good but serving size small.

Overall, would not eat here again but it was open on Christmas so that's something.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Cheese sticks - They are hit or miss. Sometimes there's barely any cheese, others it's too much. I still enjoy them.

Wings - They changed their wings in quality and price. The kind they have now are more breaded. They have a nice flavor.

Pizza - The pizza is decent. Way better than chain restaurants for sure. 

All in all it's a nice restaurant. If they make an error or you don't like what you've ordered, they'll accommodate you with no issue. Big bonus they're open until 4am.

Review: Yummy - friends also tried & loved. Dining in or taking out, Zio Al's never disappoints. We have tried pizzas & subs. My favorite is Alfredo with pepperoni. Hubz loves all meat & the meatball sub. Frankly, we will probably go through a majority of the menu since we live so close. 
Salads are salads. This isn't a dig. If any establishment wants to up their game: have at it. For the most part they are all alike unless they have the house dressing made with red sauce. Lettuce is always crunchy water no matter how ya package it. Back to Zio's: getcha a nice greasy slice. Add it to your Yelp. It's with it.

Review: My family was ordering from here at least 1-2x a month.  Stopped going because the last time my wife placed an order over the phone and went to pick up the order, they did not have the order at all.  Seems like the person that took the order never placed it after hanging up.

Mistakes happen and that's fine, but the problem is the person tried to be dismissive and did not acknowledge the problem.  No sorry or anything.

Review: I got this place delivered. I got the gyro pizza, traditional wings (lemon pepper) and the Cesar salad. 

The pizza was decent... they put ALOT of cheese in their pizza. And the crust is really soft so your crusts might stick together when you pull it, not the usual pizza texture you would expect? 

The wings are great but the lemon pepper was VERY SALTY. I think it would have been perfect if it wasn't so salty.

The salad was very average. Overall I think a place worth checking out if you like cheesy pizza! I think their pizza is the selling point.

Review: They could not make a pizza without cheese due to a food allergy. That is unfortunate since we were from out of town and wanted to order pizzas for our family...among a few other items with the pizzas too.

Unfortunately, we don't plan to return to any of their locations for a while. Do better, Zio Al. You could have the best pizza in town, so get your quality control in order before it gets worse. Hair is unacceptable

Edit: Sarah from Zio Al reached out to us and apologized, which we appreciated! When a company can take accountability, it really shows they want to improve and put customers first. Something I never see in national pizza chains. 
We hope to return again sometime and leave another, hopefully positive, review when that time comes. No restaurant is perfect, so just be careful. I'm positive this was a rare mistake

Review: I let this pizza place waste an hour of my day and they didn't care! 

I just left and I'm absolutely pissed. I ordered takeout and waited an hour (which was also a little slow on my part but I did anyway)

The chick at the counter kept saying a few more minutes and then i proceeded to watch people who came after me walk in and get their food.

I feel like I was being toyed with and wasn't taken serious. Great pizza but I will never eat here again. 

Let's see if I get this "voucher" I was promised as she wrote my wife's name and number on a sticky note 

I left a pizza place waste an hour of my time today.

Review: The food is good... when they give you your correct order. Here's a hack - order from here on Uber Eats, watch them get your order wrong, and then get a refund for your food and tip a friendly Uber Eats driver. Trust me, it's happened to me 3 times now.

One of the times I ordered a gyro pizza, which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, gyro meat, white sauce, etc. I received a pizza with only gyro meat on it. I don't even know how an employee can allow that to happen. Are you not looking directly at the food at all when closing the pizza box lid?

This time I requested "thin crispy", which is a literal $2 up-charge - and I received a normal pizza. I also requested for the pepperoni to be halal - a $1 up-charge. When they can't pay attention to one modification, how can I trust that they're paying attention to another?? Definitely will not be letting my halal-only parents eat any. 

Tonight Uber Eats notified me that I have ordered from this place six times, I was surprised and disappointed with myself. Disappointed because they've officially gotten 3 out of 6 orders I have placed with them wrong, surprised because I can't believe I let it happen a third time. 

Like I said, if you'll eat whatever they deliver and want to get a refund without lying - apparently 50% of the time this will be your spot.

Review: I used Zio Al's catering for a work event that took place at the Private School where I work. They were extremely helpful from beginning to end. This event was to feed 120 guests who also had dietary restrictions. I was able to share what I was looking for and 2 of their managers Zafnat and Moe ensured that my needs were met. They were communicative via phone, and email, and answered all of my questions. I had never heard of or used Zio Al's, so I did a quick Google search, reviewed their menu, and reached out.  Not only were they affordable, but they were also reliable and the food was tasty!

If you have an event that needs catering, I highly recommend using Zio Al's.

Review: I am sad to say my family will not be ordering from this location ever again. We have been huge fans and loyal customers to this location for the last 3 years. We have ALWAYS ordered delivery and had excellent service from the drivers and employees. Tonight on the later shift, we called to place our normal order and the female that was answering phone was not only rude, but told us they do not deliver to our location. Again, we have been getting delivery from them for 3 years and literally delivered 3 days prior to us. When we asked why and how would that have changed, she said because we live 12 minutes away and they only deliver to 10 minutes away... what an absolute joke. She even said "oh yeah I see you guys order from us a lot.." Her name is Sarah, she needs to be fired. She is causing you to lose loyal customers. We are extremely disappointed as we always order over $60 worth of food and tip the drivers $20. As a store manager myself, I can assure you, Sarah is bad for your business.

Review: Pizza arrived warm but still didn't taste tooo fresh for some reason. The crusts for the pizzas were unevenly cooked and had some doughy parts. Very bread-y pizza so if you like that this is the place to go. 

The cheesy bread was underwhelming, essentially a cheese pizza without sauce and very oily. 
Fries are good but serving size small.

Overall, would not eat here again but it was open on Christmas so that's something.

Rating: 3 stars
Review: Cheese sticks - They are hit or miss. Sometimes there's barely any cheese, others it's too much. I still enjoy them.

Wings - They changed their wings in quality and price. The kind they have now are more breaded. They have a nice flavor.

Pizza - The pizza is decent. Way better than chain restaurants for sure. 

All in all it's a nice restaurant. If they make an error or you don't like what you've ordered, they'll accommodate you with no issue. Big bonus they're open until 4am.

Review: Yummy - friends also tried & loved. Dining in or taking out, Zio Al's never disappoints. We have tried pizzas & subs. My favorite is Alfredo with pepperoni. Hubz loves all meat & the meatball sub. Frankly, we will probably go through a majority of the menu since we live so close. 
Salads are salads. This isn't a dig. If any establishment wants to up their game: have at it. For the most part they are all alike unless they have the house dressing made with red sauce. Lettuce is always crunchy water no matter how ya package it. Back to Zio's: getcha a nice greasy slice. Add it to your Yelp. It's with it.

Review: My family was ordering from here at least 1-2x a month.  Stopped going because the last time my wife placed an order over the phone and went to pick up the order, they did not have the order at all.  Seems like the person that took the order never placed it after hanging up.

Mistakes happen and that's fine, but the problem is the person tried to be dismissive and did not acknowledge the problem.  No sorry or anything.

Review: I used to love this place! The last few times I've ordered from this location my food has not been good. It doesn't even look or taste the same like it used to. This is the closest location to me but I would rather drive to the other locations knowing I will be satisfied.

Review: The food is over priced but the wings are really good. The staff is a little rude and off putting, but it's bearable because we like the wings and they deliver. Favorite thing about this place is the hours of operation.

Review: Great pizza!   Ordered 20 pizzas and salads for delivery for an office lunch.  Easy process ordering online, great customer service calling with updates.   Team loved the pizza!

Review: I got this place delivered. I got the gyro pizza, traditional wings (lemon pepper) and the Cesar salad. 

The pizza was decent... they put ALOT of cheese in their pizza. And the crust is really soft so your crusts might stick together when you pull it, not the usual pizza texture you would expect? 

The wings are great but the lemon pepper was VERY SALTY. I think it would have been perfect if it wasn't so salty.

The salad was very average. Overall I think a place worth checking out if you like cheesy pizza! I think their pizza is the selling point.

Review: Greek salad is awesome. Their baked subs are really tasty as well. I Love that they are open till 3 a.m. , where else can you get fresh food at 3? These guys are awesome.

Review: They could not make a pizza without cheese due to a food allergy. That is unfortunate since we were from out of town and wanted to order pizzas for our family...among a few other items with the pizzas too. This place is not in the hospitality business and not trying to serve customers to be profitable. Guess the local Dominos gets more business tonight.

Review: I placed an order for pick up and told ready at 6pm per app. I was late and arrived at 6:30p and told by staff 3-4 minutes. Pizza finally given to me at 6:45p, now 45 minutes after the original time promised and it was the wrong pizza. When pointed out, the cashier answered the phone and ignored me, so I left with the wrong pizza. 
Food has always been good as was this visit, but I will never return!

Review: We love Zio Als!  I always like finding a good non-national chain pizza place to support and this is our go-to local pizza delivery option.

They have quite an extensive menu here, with lots of toppings and pre-made recipes for the pizzas.  My absolute favorites are the Signature Pizza (NY Style Crust, Pepperoni, Beef, Breakfast Bacon, Basil, Sliced Tomatoes and Mozarella) and Spinach Alfredo (Alfredo Sauce, Spinach, and Cheese).  They also have several crust options, including stuffed crust.

We've gotten some of the breadsticks/cheesesticks, apps, and desserts a few times, and they're decent.  It's the pizza itself that keeps us coming back.

Bonus: open late - until 3AM!

Review: Third time picking up from Zio and will be our last. Tonight we got the hand tossed half Hawaiian and half chicken pesto. Way too much cheese, threw it out of balance. The pesto sauce was very oily and somewhat an off putting taste. Combined with all the cheese, made for a terribly greasy pie. The Hawaiian portion was better. Our first visit was more than a year ago. Got deep dish, weren't fans and didn't plan on a return. A month ago friends ordered a margarita and pepperoni, thin crusts, which were good. You will notice that they offer 5 or 6 different types of crusts. My experience is few places can excel at all. Maybe thin crust is the way to go?

Review: Best thing about this place, it's open late. Fresh food late at night. 

I had their lemon pepper wings and man... these were huge!!! Extremely crispy and full of flavor. Highly recommend it. I also had their boneless wings with their signature sweet teriyaki sauce, would definitely get that next time except with flats. 

Now pizzas- another great service they offer- you can order half and half so obviously we did just that. 1 small pizza can easily fill up 4 people. We ordered the Buffalo pizza with half BBQ pizza. I liked the BBQ one more compared to buffalo. Second pizza was NY specialty and Meatball lovers. For this one, the sure win was the Meatball lover. Don't get me wrong, they were all great, just the meatball lover was the best. 

If you're in Dallas I would definitely recommend this place.

Review: The night shift worker is extremely rude she wears glasses. I came in one time & she asked me if i was going to tip & but  then she insisted that i didn't have too. Is that what you guys train your employees to do ? The cheesecake here is terrible.  the crust tastes old. Pizza here never looks great compared to the other locations. Im a loyal customer i've been to all the other locations throughout the metroplex . Not sure if this is a real policy but i asked if i could change the size of my pizza & she told me i couldn't because the pizza was in the oven already so if i wanted to get another size i would have to buy another pizza.  This one by far is the worst. If you guys don't mind the drive go to the one in McKinney they are 100x better pizza is amazing !

Review: I am a regular here until the food and service went down dramatically, I ordered wings and I got 8 of the smallest and thinest wings I ever seen I am eating bones w barely meat, on top of all of that the staff are all rude and they r v aggressive and ready to argue if needed, no one smile, I came once and the server wanted to seat me on a table that wasn't cleaned and I asked him to clean the table, he didn't like that I said that to him so he accused me of giving him an order and accused me of disrespecting him for saying that !! even the manager handled the situation very  poorly without Investigating the nature of the incident, Any ways I knew the owner I thought he should know I send him a text msg and I was ignored!!, they seem to careless about the customers, I will never go back again !

Review: We ordered the meatball sandwich and the chicken club. 
They were both good and everything was an appropriate warm temperature.  The fries were great,although not a large portion. 

I was highly irritated that if you want to have veggies or anything on it they up charge you for every single thing. It's exactly why i did not* order the wings, if you want any sauce/flavor on it they up charge an additional 99 cents! Insane. 

Service was fine, i ordered online and to go, so interaction was extremely minimal. 

If they stopped nickel and diming on the menu and provided a slightly larger portion to meet the high prices this place would 100% be 5 stars for the sandwiches.

Review: I was in town for 3 weeks on a business trip.  I asked a local friend who had really good authentic pizza?  She very highly recommended Zito Al's and boy I now see why.  I got the loaded meat pizza not one but twice while I was in town.  It was so easy to keep reaching in for another slice I ate the whole large pizza in one sitting each time.  The service was fantastic, and I had the same delivery driver both times and he was awesome, friendly and always on time.  The next time I'm back in the area which will be soon, I know where I'm going for great pizza.

Review: Zio Al's always come through clutch. Whether its late night or mid-day, their pizza is hands down delicious ! I've tried their chicken Alfredo, Margherita, and a few others, but long story short - I would never order from Domino's or any corporate chain again. Their wings are huge LOL. Zio Al's for the win every time !
